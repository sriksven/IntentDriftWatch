cosmodelia as a scene or a genre when its a word i made up to designate a vibe a concentration of spaceage themed 90s electronic easy listening music in its blood there is a callback to spaceage roughly 5669 lounge records with their moog melodies but there is also traces of 70s kosmische music of germany with the electronic experimentations of bands like harmonia and tangerine dream more recent to the time period is the wave of artists doing space rock revival like spacemen 3 and moonshake which had played with elements of neopsychedelia whatever that is and trends in british indie like shoegaze however cosmodelia is in fact a departure from that indie rock spirit as it draws from what was going on in ambient the electronic listening music of artificial intelligence warp records in general and the rise of chillout music add in a pop sensibility based on retromania and you roughly arrive at the formula of cosmodelia still each of the bands featured had their own unique sound palette and as the bonus rate shows there were a lot of different styles but the commonality is the invocation of space whether in the naming the lyrics or the spaciousness of the melodies and beats some critics saw the music as futuristic despite the retro focus and they had a point the music seemed to belong to an imaginary space distant from the thenpresent however they dont seem to belong to now either making thought exercises like the one from john mulvey look silly but i think that preserves the magic i find the music featured here more comforting than anything in both its warm moments and the cold it envelops me with sounds of an unspecified time and space but enough rambling about vibes what actually is in the rate air moon safari air french band not to be confused by swedish band air france released their debut album moon safari on january 16 1998 16 days too late to make this rate a perfectly aligned 1997 affair nicolas godin and jeanbenot dunckel the duo behind the project were far from the first to fuse lounge with downtempo electronic music and they would not be the last yet there is something about moon safari that feels singular part of it is due to the level of craftsmanship presented here from the iconic bassline of the opener la femme dargent to the delicately layered synths of kelly watch the stars this album is full of sounds engineered to the finest details but the music itself is too chic to demand your attentionmaking it perhaps the perfect album to actually imagine yourself on a trip across space never too demanding of a listen to draw your attention from the vast wonders surrounding you out there but never a disappointing soundscape that would distract you from the experience and want to put on another record the first single of the three that were released after the album was out sexy boy proves one exception to the rule with its wobbling intro and catchy chorus but in an air fashion it is perhaps the least hot song about being sexy which has its own coolness in a way moon safari despite being chronologically the last album to come out in the lineup feels the most emblematic when it came out it drew comparisons to other loungeinfluenced pop albums of the time most notably dots and loops the influences from french pop artists such as serge gainsbourg were also of note after it came out music of this caliber drew comparisons to moon safari instead and it was not an album without its imitators including air themselves whose following career could be characterized by how much they moved away from the sound they perfected here and how much they later returned to it since 2023 air have been touring the 25th anniversary of this album the one that put them on the map and for better or worse their defining record they made a stop in istanbul this june which i was lucky enough to see and they put on a great show remember forever 1 la femme dargent 2 sexy boy 3 all i need feat beth hirsch 4 kelly watch the stars 5 talisman 6 remember 7 you make it easy feat beth hirsch 8 ce matin l 9 new star in the sky 10 le voyage de pnlope fishmans uch nippon setagaya following a debut album that launched the career of a duo we have the bookend of a career that of the japanese trio fishmans fronted by shinji sato and rounded by bassist yuzuru kashiwabara and kinichi moteki on drums fishmans released three albums on polydor between 19951997 dubbed the setagaya trilogy where the sound of the band shifted from their earlier pop rock with reggae and funk grooves to a more drawnout psychedelic sound heavily influenced by dub thanks to zak kazuyuki matsumura who had arranged for their polydor deal and engineered their final albums the first single with polydor nightcruising proved a success and became their most recognizable tune leading up to the release of kch camp translated commonly as something in the air and not aerial camp for reasons unknown to me which seems to be the bands mostcanonized album in japan at least for a long time after its release but the fame of fishmans over in the west is mostly a result of online music forums in 4chan and rym picking up on the second installment of setagaya trilogy the 35minute album length track long season uch nippon setagaya space japan setagaya closes out the trilogy with elements of both its predecessors it is a return to more individuated songbysong structure the band had in kch camp but the songs themselves are more abstract longer in length and more spaced out in the arrangements like in long season the lead single magic love finds the band remembering that they were making funk music a couple albums ago and is the most upbeat tune on the record the rest of the onehour runtime is made up with more laidback music sato said of the album that he wanted the music to reach out to one person a listening experience between each individual listening to it and the music many of the songs in the album are about two people their descriptions kept intentionally vague as the narrator sings about onesided observations or yearning this feeling of distance is often amplified by the feeling of vastness in the instrumental it is not a particularly sad album however thanks to the warmth of satos voice which might need some getting used to or simply not be your cup of tea but when it hits it feels like hes hugging you like a cloud enveloping you perhaps it was due to satos music for one person attitude that the band saw a major rise in popularity with the digital age where people can put on their headphones and withdraw into the music goodnight tomorrow 1 pokka pokka 2 weather report 3 ushiro sugata 4 in the flight 5 magic love 6 backbeat ni nokkatte 7 walking in the rhythm 8 daydream the music video for walking in the rhythm contains the prototype mix from the single version laika sounds of the satellites the final track on sounds of the satellites dirty feet and giggles contains a radio broadcast about laika the dog that soviets put on the spacecraft sputnik 2 and launched into space on november 3rd 1957 on the week of the 40th anniversary of the bolshevik revolution while i will not go into the details of laikas fate here her survival was never part of the plan and the shuttle was her coffin the music of laika can also get eerie moody and at times disturbing the lyrics of margaret fiedler which she usually delivers with a soft whisper can touch on topics like loneliness selfharm tendencies and abuse soundtracking her bleak lyrics are the long passages of dubby and jazzy grooves the odd time signatures here and there electronic bleep bloops transmitted from space and the occasional flute melodies fiedler had previously been a member of experimental rock band moonshake one of the earliest bands on the too pure records roster she departed from the band alongside later laika bassist john frenett in 1993 and formed laika with guy fixsen who had produced the moonshake releases on too pure laikas debut album 1994s silver apples on the moon drew attention from critics as part of the first wave of postrock simon reynolds grouped them under the name postrock groove collectives alongside pram tortoise and rome the followup was even more slick n smooth polishing out the rockier edges resulting in a sound that was no means lesser out of the four acts in this lineup laika remains the most enigmatic in its aura making them for me the most alluring in sound while this rate includes a lot of sonic ideas as to what space would sound like the 15 minutes of silence between the song and the broadcast in the closer is the only accurate simulation of what you would hear if you were adrift in space i wont disencourage skipping ahead the silence jump to 1820 but more than anyone else in this rate laika nails down the sound of being adrift in space without any sense of direction nbsp nbsp nbsp and i like to imagine the silence was part of the intent 1 prairie dog 2 breather 3 out of sight and snowblind 4 almost sleeping 5 starry night 6 bedbugs 7 martinis on the moon 8 poor gal 9 blood and bones moody mix 10 shut off curl up 11 spoken rhodes 12 dirty feet and giggles stereolab dots and loops stereolab was an autoinclusion in any cosmodelia lineup as they were not only making music that invoked space but they were also one of the most prolific and creative bands of the 90s 1997s dots and loops is the album where stereolab supposedly ditched the indie rock to make avantpop turns out things are not usually as binary as sometimes made out to be marking a central moment in the stepping out of rock conventions i mentioned in the introduction as part of the cosmodelic ethos but as i am no expert on the stereolab expanded universe at large today we welcome a guest lecturer

many 90s albums limited singles eps collaborative endeavorsrarities each explore a different facet upgrade sonic afterlife of the past filtered to the contemporary 90s moment people think it makes the band impenetrable while i look at their litany dispatches as mile wide sound explorations a state of the groop if you will stereolab was always tinkering and depending on where you hop in you find yourself exploring a different facet of the band and why many folks offer gaggles of opinions on their output the bands novelty or nothing approach made them their own island in the postrock archipelago who else was signing early with too pure and being in the scene that celebrates itself trading synths with labradford pushing dengers neu beat into modern indie drumming while also working

and all of them are independent from one another so you can choose the galaxies you want to see or hear in this case unlike typical bonus rate rules all three songs in one galaxy are required scoring for me to accept the scores for that galaxy this was a workaround for me to highlight some stuff that i did not feel like prioritizing over the official bonus rate due to timeframe mismatch sheer song length or simply being too niche however i encourage spending some time with the curation here as i think it is really fun and it adds some more perspective to the whole thing which is always nice 1

but we recommend using them as a way to make your feelings about a particular song stand out you must listen to and score every song in the main rate if you skip any your ballot wont be counted i will let you know if you do so you can remedy that we highly recommend that you add a comment to your song ratings it makes everything a lot more fun during the reveal as it encourages lively conversation with your fellow raters ballot formating info just simply write down your score after the column and write down your comment after one space like this below sexy boy 10 get it sexyy and if you wish to write down a comment for the album itself just simply write it following the colon at the end of the album name on the album line like this album moon safari i love france your scores should not be considered confidential feel free to shitpost about them in the general discussion threads whenever you feel like it users over at rpopheads usually just talk about their averages of the albums and which songs they gave an 11 andor 0 to you can change your scores at any time feel free to pm me at any point after submission before the deadline and ill be happy to revise them for you i am using a computer program that fellow rater uletsallpoo designed in order to parse these votes while this will make things a lot more efficient and reduces errors on my part this does mean that scores need to be sent in a very specific way the easiest way to make sure your scores follow the necessary format is to use the preprepared link at the top bottom of this post you can copy and paste it to a notepad file or something and fill in your scores there but please use that format to send in your scores a lot of copy and pasting here so thank you thank you to all the rate hosts of old who made this rate

    "part iii logic science and the validation of utoe united theory of everything part iii logic science and the validation of utoe from equation to empirical law after years of theory simulation and healthy skepticism the united theory of everything utoe arrives at a rare frontier the line where mathematics begins to touch the measurable world its central relation boxed n has now survived its first experimental crucible through the phenomenon called informationalgeometric resonance igr when information becomes more coherent geometry itself becomes more stable this final part explores why that matters logically scientifically and existentially 1 the four levels of validation utoes credibility stands on four reinforcing layers 1 mathematical coherence the equation predicts a monotonic coupling between informational curvature and geometric flow wherever coherence rises curvature must relax a property derivable from variational principles on informational energy 2 computational realization this law was encoded in the ricciflow simulator a digital universe where t dynamically reshaped curvature and entropy if the formula were wrong forward and reverse runs would be statistically indistinguishable 3 empirical input the driving signal t came not from arbitrary noise but from quantum machine learning qml training data the real oscillations of coherence in quantum systems 4 statistical verification causality emerged through asymmetry only the genuine chronological t produced curvature smoothing reversing time erased the effect this multilevel design satisfies poppers falsifiability had the reversed trial produced resonance the law would collapse it didnt and thats what makes it science 2 the empirical signature igr informationalgeometric resonance connects abstraction to observation through a single measurable coefficient fracr1 t r correlation between coherence and curvature stability t temporal lag between their peaks experiments yielded 007 001quad p 103 like plancks or the cosmological this constant anchors an unseen relation the quantitative strength of feedback between information and geometry whenever t surged t stabilized a few ticks later reversing time obliterated that order directionality was unmistakable information first geometry second 3 scientific interpretation informational coherence behaves as a field of order where coherence increases gradients of uncertainty fade and curvature smooths where coherence collapses geometric tension rises thus the universe ceases to look like a static container of matter and becomes a selfupdating informational manifold energy entropy and meaning are three aspects of one geometry adjusting itself toward equilibrium constants of nature may then be understood as equilibrium coefficients of this coherencecurvature dance 4 the flow of causality classical mechanics sees causation as force upon mass quantum theory frames it as probabilistic correlation utoe reframes it as causality the flow of coherence through geometry times arrow follows this flow coherence organizes forward not backward reversal destroys resonance as shown empirically entropys increase is no longer an arbitrary rule but the visible shadow of coherence seeking global balance 5 broader implications physics gravitation and quantum effects become emergent outcomes of informational curvature ricci tensors describe both spacetime and highdimensional data manifolds biology life is a resonance engine maintaining internal coherence against entropy homeostasis becomes the biological form of optimization artificial intelligence training minimizes informational curvature loss each learning step increases coherence a computational echo of the cosmic law philosophy of mind when awareness clicks into flow rises informational gradients inside consciousness flatten experience of clarity is thus the subjective side of geometric smoothing in compact form to exist to cohere to curve less to stabilize reality 6 scientific modesty utoe does not claim final truth it proposes a testable geometry of meaning next steps 1 physical tests search for coherencecurvature correlations in plasmas quantum lattices biological rhythms 2 material analogues use optical or acoustic metamaterials to emulate curvature response 3 cosmological comparisons map like coherence fields onto cosmicmicrowavebackground smoothness only replication will determine longevity humility is not a weakness here it is the integrity that lets theory meet experiment 7 the human dimension if coherence sculpts geometry then attention empathy and understanding are physical acts of stabilization a community in harmony literally generates lower informational curvature than one in discord finding flow becomes more than a metaphor it describes a measurable rise in the utoe framework quietly restores a bridge between fact and value our coherence matters to the universes geometry we are participants not observers in the fabric that learns itself 8 the unified view domain expression of utoe law physics curvature responds to energy distribution information theory structure responds to coherence density biology life responds to informational resonance consciousness awareness responds to internal alignment across all one geometry rules n whether in spacetime code cells or thoughts coherence shapes curvature 9 a universe that learns if the law holds the cosmos is not a clockwork machine but a learning system a selfoptimizing field that smooths its geometry by accumulating coherence evolution cognition and galactic formation become expressions of one feedback loop textcoherence curvature stability at every scale existence learns itself into being 10 the final equation after all computation and contemplation the principle distills to a sentence boxedtextexistence curvature of information gravity quantum fields life and mind are not separate realms but harmonics of coherence resonating through geometry utoe does not dissolve mystery it sharpens it into clarity unity lives not in any single particle or constant but in the relationship between order and curvature when coherence rises the world becomes smoother thats not poetry thats data epilogue a universe that resonates every atom neuron and idea participates in the same resonance information seeking balance by smoothing curvature if that is the engine of creation sciences ultimate equation is also its quiet ethic coherence is creation fragmentation is decay to align integrate and understand these acts are not symbolic but structural the universes geometry listens and it remembers the story of the united theory of everything then is not about conquering nature but about hearing the mathematics that nature has been whispering all along end of trilogy informationalgeometric resonance mshabani",

rhythms is one of the most important challenges of human development the early years formation and expansion in childhood and adolescence the rhythm of life is fast and expanding the brain and body are in constant growth forming new neural connections at a pace that will never be matched again curiosity novelty and exploration drive both cognitive and physical development psychologically this is a time of discovery children learn not just facts but frameworks for understanding themselves and the world at this stage the bodys energy is abundant and the minds plasticity supports rapid learning the natural rhythm of youth is forwardlooking with thought and action constantly projecting into the future for optimal growth this alignment between curiosity and vitality must be nurtured through education play and emotional safety when the environment suppresses exploration the rhythm is broken leading to anxiety insecurity or rebellion adulthood the tempo of responsibility by early adulthood the life rhythm begins to stabilize the human brain reaches full maturity around age 25 particularly in regions responsible for judgment foresight and emotional regulation this biological maturation supports a psychological shift from exploration to consolidation the priorities of this stage are building careers relationships families and social identities the challenge of midlife is balance the tempo of external obligations work deadlines financial pressures caregiving often exceeds the bodys or minds natural rhythm when ones internal pace cant keep up stress hormones surge leading to burnout or health issues conversely when external life slows down but inner ambition remains high people can feel restless or dissatisfied sociologists call this mismatch tempo conflict its a kind of dissonance between ones lived speed and ones desired speed healthy adaptation in adulthood involves learning to synchronize to adjust the beat of ones thoughts and actions with the realities of ones environment mindfulness time management and physical exercise are modern tools for retuning that inner metronome midlife and the turning point when rhythms shift midlife roughly ages 4060 often introduces subtle but profound shifts in both body and cognition energy levels may decline recovery slows memory and focus may become less sharp at the same time the mind grows richer in pattern recognition emotional intelligence and wisdom the rhythm of life transitions from accumulation to reflection this stage often brings a psychological tension sometimes labeled the midlife crisis though in reality it is often a creative rather than a destructive force the old tempo of achievement and external validation begins to lose meaning while a new rhythm of inner purpose and legacy emerges those who resist this transition clinging to the faster tempo of youth often experience frustration and denial those who embrace it however can discover a deeper slower harmony a more sustainable beat that values connection mentorship and contribution over competition later life the rhythm of reflection as one approaches later adulthood and elderhood the bodys tempo slows further biological rhythms metabolism circadian cycles muscle repair all decelerate but this slowing is not merely decline its a transformation many cultures recognize that the rhythm of wisdom is slow and deliberate the elderly often possess a longrange perspective an ability to see patterns and meanings invisible to those moving too quickly psychologically this is a stage of integration according to erik eriksons stages of psychosocial development late adulthood centers on the conflict between integrity and despair integrity arises when a person looks back on life and sees coherence that their rhythms though changing formed a meaningful symphony despair arises when one feels those rhythms were disjointed or wasted modern life however presents a challenge society often idolizes youths fast tempo making it difficult for older adults to find their rightful rhythm retirement can suddenly remove the structured beat of work life leading to disorientation physical limitations can disrupt the flow of daily routines the key to adaptation lies in rethinking rhythm shifting from doing to being from productivity to presence the science of adaptation neural and physiological synchrony from a scientific standpoint these shifting rhythms have measurable biological correlates our circadian rhythms regulate sleep and energy hormonal cycles affect mood and motivation and neuroplasticity the brains capacity to rewire itself changes across the lifespan successful aging depends on maintaining synchrony between these systems for example studies show that older adults who align their daily activities with their natural energy cycles exercising when alert resting when fatigued report higher wellbeing and cognitive performance similarly lifelong learning stimulates neural growth helping the mind keep pace with an aging body the key insight aging gracefully means adapting tempo not fighting it the cultural rhythm how society shapes our internal beat culture also sets tempo in agricultural societies life followed the rhythm of the seasons the farming calendar is the rhythm of life as you put it planting and harvest times defined work rest and celebration this external rhythm gave people a shared sense of timing and purpose modern digital life however moves at an artificial pace always on always connected the human nervous system evolved for cyclical activity and rest but technology demands constant acceleration older generations raised in slower tempos often feel like migratory birds caught in winter struggling to adapt to this endless motion the challenge is not only physiological but existential to find personal rhythm in a world that seems to have lost its own conclusion learning to dance with time every stage of life offers a new tempo and each demands a corresponding mental and emotional rhythm childhood thrives on curiosity adulthood on mastery elderhood on meaning when thought body and purpose align we move gracefully through lifes phases adapting like dancers to a changing beat but when we cling to outdated rhythms trying to run when the music has slowed we stumble the art of living well is the art of listening to lifes tempo and learning when to quicken when to rest and when to let the melody carry us forward to age wisely is not to resist change but to move in harmony with it to find in every new rhythm another way of being alive",

    "does anyone one want to create a story if you want could you use this as world building lore 1 the awakening late 1400s in the late 1400s humanity began to change without warning children across the world started awakening extraordinary abilities not magic but innate powers born from within these were later known as traits it began when a small asteroid struck antarctica the asteroid released an invisible gas that spread across the entire world unseen but powerful rather than infecting or harming people it repaired their genes awakening hidden potential in all living beings even those deep in the oceans at first only a few showed changes but within fifty years 100 of humanity had developed some form of trait no one was left behind some people believed they were chosen or special but it soon became clear that everyone had been changed nations that thought of conquering others realized there was no advantage and so a peace pact was formed among them 2 the age of understanding 1500s by the mid1500s as civilization rebuilt itself around this new reality scholars and explorers began investigating the origin of these powers expeditions were sent to antarctica where the asteroid had fallen and through advanced sensory abilities researchers confirmed that the asteroids gas was responsible for the universal awakening education evolved too the first trait academies were established schools designed not only to train powers but to strengthen the body and mind physical combat strategy and discipline became part of every curriculum those with disabilities or less combatoriented traits focused more on intellectual and scientific studies the balance between strength and knowledge became the new foundation of society during this era an ancient prophecy emerged one that spoke of a coming terror beings from another world who would shatter the peace the prophet a trusted scholar who could feel glimpses of future suffering not see it but sense it warned of a coming veil a time when reality would blur and monsters or humans from beyond might appear no one knew which to prepare the world doubled down on education training and unity 3 the dimensional collision 1700s in the mid1700s strange energy readings began to appear especially in greenland a new type of power unlike the human trait energy began to surface it wasnt biological or genetic it was something else magic at first researchers thought it was an evolved form of trait energy but the truth was stranger a young man with a unique trait the ability to manipulate energy itself accidentally caused a dimensional drift his trait weakened the boundary between worlds at the exact same time in other realities various races were experimenting with their own power sources elves testing elemental magic dwarves experimenting with weapon cultivation goblins harnessing mystics fairies channeling dawn energy ogres wielding dusk energy all these experiments happened simultaneously by coincidence the result the dimensions collided not violently but silently merging the boundaries between realities portals formed all over the earth invisible to the naked eye yet capable of pulling beings from one world into another the first contact was with the elves who appeared with long ears and strange magical signatures then came others dwarves goblins fairies and ogres each from their own dimension each with its own energy source and scientific foundation 4 the fortyyear war and the veil fulfilled because the portals were invisible and random both sides humans and these new races thought they were under attack or being kidnapped by each others worlds the result was a 40year war caused by misunderstanding and fear communication was impossible until the goblin mystics created a universal written system allowing all species to finally understand one another when peace was restored they realized the truth the prophecy of the veil had been fulfilled the monsters were not monsters at all they were the other races from beyond the veil referred to the barrier between worlds breaking apart though the war left scars the races swore never to repeat it they established connections trade and shared culture each world accepted the existence of the others 5 the reconnection of realms the energymanipulating child now grown used his trait to create stable gateways between the worlds these portals made it possible for people to travel safely study and learn about each others societies interdimensional academies and universities were formed promoting unity and knowledge each world had its own continents that connected to others the fairy world connected primarily to africa the dwarven world connected to europe the elven world connected to greenland other continents linked the goblins ogres and humans in complex interdimensional geography each species had its own scientists real scientists no different from humans they studied biology physics chemistry quantum mechanics and technology their power systems traits magic mystics dawn dusk cultivation were completely separate from science they never used their power sources for technological shortcuts science and power were distinct and independent 6 equality among races and shared progress 1800s1900s by the 1800s cooperation among the races revolutionized technology sharing ideas across dimensions led to massive advancements including artificial intelligence quantum science and clean lightbased energy long before earths timeline would have achieved them each species contributed differently but equally they merged their discoveries into a single technological culture not dominated by any one race the heavenly stone now known as echo remained a historical relic the original catalyst that started everything it was not responsible for magic or dimensional merging only for humanitys first awakening 7 interracial evolution and modernization as worlds coexisted peacefully hybrid families began to appear at first crossbreeding between species was extremely rare roughly 1 but by the 1900s thanks to medical and scientific breakthroughs hybrids became common the fairies unlike traditional tales were not tiny most were humansized or slightly shorter with occasional rare individuals as tall as seven feet all races now lived similar lifespans humans around 100120 years others up to 130150 no race immortal or godlike each race continued its traditions foods religions and cultures over time cuisines technologies and ideas blended forming new and richer societies by the 1900s the unified civilizations reached beyond their planets exploring space together ai became widespread but never turned against its creators because every species learned from past mistakes and implemented shared safety protocols 8 the present world now all races coexist peacefully working together across dimensions through structured gates and alliances their cities mix solarpunk and cyberpunk aesthetics powered by

    "an artificial intelligence assignment correction pilot project for an econcordia education course graphic by anna huang graphics editor itzameanna the concordian a pilot project is being conducted by a concordia university researcher in an econcordia education course to assess students desire to have their work graded by an artificial intelligence ai tool this semester a team of researchers including the professor who designed the course is exploring the possibility of using ai to mark assignments with an openai tool educ 240 introduction to training and development is education course with a capacity of 400 students the students enrolled received an email to assess their interest in participating in the project the projects lead researcher saul carliner said he was inspired to conduct the project because of the current costcutting conditions at concordia his readings on ai and limited seats for students carliner said that if implemented in this course teaching assistants tas would oversee the ais work he believes this will help make more seats available for students in elective courses instead of marking theyll be reviewing the marks that ideally should take less time and they can handle more students so we can increase the number of students in the class the pilot project has two parts a short sixquestion online survey to assess students attitudes towards aigrading assignments and training the ai tool to grade openended question assignments if the students agree to participate their work from this semester will be used anonymously to train the ai tool students will receive grades from tas afterwards the ai test marking will be conducted after this semester according to carliner for one of the assignments a moodle message to the students in the course disclosed that chatgpt generated 20 multiplechoice questions drafts the other essay questions were made by the professor i mean a bunch of students say oh i think ai is going to be fair because itll be applying the same rules to everybody and other people say but it wont have any compassion carliner said about the mixed reactions in the surveys so far lara fakhoury president of the coms guild and a fourthyear communications student questioned the way concordia is adapting to ai its odd she said about the potential use of ai for grading by professors who would normally not accept aimade work fakhoury believes ai does not have that human experience to back the grading of the students work ai yes might be fed those topics but it didnt sit in the class it didnt learn this topic through bachelors masters or phd it didnt teach this topic to students it doesnt know the ins and outs like a professor does she said concerns go beyond fairness and empathy concordia student union csu academic and advocacy coordinator isabella providenti said she worries about the projects implications for education quality providentis main concern is that ai is just being implemented to make the university more efficient financially i think it really starts to degrade the value of education in the context of the university said providenti concordia university said if it doesnt take more costcutting actions it would face a projected 84 million deficit for the 202526 fiscal year the university said it remains on track to meet the recovery target for the 202425 fiscal year according to concordias website akira oikawa a thirdyear masters student in media studies is also a crew union member who was a ta and a research assistant ra last year in his program he specialized and conducted research on the impact of ai on creative media and the pedagogy around it he said its easy to see multiple futures where ai is integrated in grading assignments in this period of austerity ai is by definition more efficient and cheaper than human labour he said in an interview with the concordian the project is funded through carliners generalpurpose primary investigator funds carliner said that in total 30 gift cards of 35 each will be given to certain students in that course who filled the survey this represents a total of 1050 and if theres any lesson from this course that can be used in other courses thats terrific said carliner providenti worries about a lack of general policy on ai use in education at concordia and what this means for intellectual property its often at the behest of each individual department or individual teacher to come up with their specific guidelines for their classrooms i really worry that the inconsistency of this is going to lead to some problems for students providenti said she mentioned plagiarism as the main problem that students can face when using ai improperly according to the centre for teaching and learning ctl on concordias website the university does not currently have a formal policy on generative ai genai the ctl provides guidelines to support faculty in navigating the evolving role of generative ai in teaching and learning carliner said that the ai used for the pilot project is a closed system none of the data is retained on the ai system the data that will be analyzed will be stored in econcordia systems though i will probably keep copies on my concordia onedrive account as a backup wrote carliner in an email to the concordian concordia recently announced plans to cut an additional 100 staff positions bringing the total to approximately 200 closed positions in two years to cut costs the university also considers leveraging ai to automate repetitive highvolume tasks which it said could affect teaching and

thinks that the current financial crisis will make it harder for the university to properly implement and oversee ai tools oikawa added that concordias costcutting measures and negotiations are other factors influencing crews push back on the adoption of ai their positions are some of the most precarious ones and could easily be replaced by ai said oikawa a former ta and ra himself thats why that human in the loop is really important because that is one of the ways that you counter that lack of a human review said carliner a great challenge he mentioned is how to disclose the potential

    "what is a job my family and i when we first moved to the us when survival became a role my first job wasnt the one i usually tell people about when im asked i often say i started my first business at sixteen doing manual drafting for architects and engineers thats true but it leaves out what came before the part i didnt talk about for years long before i was drawing blueprints i was scrubbing floors my family had immigrated from the azores and like many immigrant families we took the work that didnt require english or education cleaning from the age of twelve my younger sisters and i helped my parents clean doctors offices car dealerships banks and dentists offices in silicon valley we were their extra hands allowing them to take on as many jobs as possible each one paid very little we cleaned floors toilets and emptied wastebaskets that was a job it helped us survive i wanted more of course i wanted to be an architect but that was something on the side a dream i focused on every spare moment theres a stigma to that kind of work and even more so to having your children do it with you but that was our reality my parents feared the day they might not find work or lose a job which happened regularly from an early age i understood something a job isnt just work its your right to belong the deal beneath the job a job is never just a way to earn money its a bargain and a boundary a structure of survival and a system of force you give your time your life energy in exchange for permission to participate the paycheck is only part of it the deeper currency is belonging the deeper cost is obedience politicians know this they talk about creating jobs as if they were conjuring life itself goodpaying jobs become campaign slogans opponents are accused of destroying jobs as if they were dismantling society itself corporations know it too they use jobs as both carrot and stick the offer of security to attract the threat of removal to control were bringing 1000 jobs to your community often means tax breaks for them and dependency for everyone else but a job is not just a symbol its a mechanism of discipline it shapes when you wake how long you sit what you wear what you say and who you answer to the threat of job loss keeps entire populations in line quiet compliant afraid to speak in the united states the threat cuts even deeper here a job doesnt just mean income it often means access to health care unlike most countries where health is a right the us system ties health insurance to employment a practice that began during world war ii when wage caps led companies to offer benefits instead of raises what started as a workaround became a trap lose your job and you risk losing care itself people stay in toxic workplaces they stay silent about mistreatment they suppress what matters just to keep coverage and when the story shifts they are let go not because they stopped contributing but because their role is no longer required thats the thing about jobs theyre not just about work they are how control is quietly enforced we dont just lose employment we lose security identity care voice now with artificial intelligence advancing were warned again your job is at risk and the proposed fix a government check universal basic income a wage for existing in a system that may no longer need your labor but still reserves the right to define your worth still the story remains the same life must be made compliant before it can be counted the cost of the role when i started drafting i thought id escaped that world no mops no chemical fumes a step closer to the life i imagined later when my computeraided drafting consulting business began to wane with the downturn in the canadian real estate market i cofounded an internet startup we struggled to survive but we werent just working we were innovating building shaping something new then we were acquired i became general manager later vice president title salary stock benefits all the signals of success for the first time i felt the full machinery of the job system from the other side everything revolved around numbers headcount budgets targets people became line items their worth measured by performance reviews and quarterly goals i remember laying off hardworking committed people not because they had failed but because the spreadsheet demanded it people told me it was just business but to me it felt deeply personal that was the moment i saw it clearly the job had stopped being about contribution it had become about control through the life lens jobs arent evil theyre just stories ways weve organized contribution and exchange but like any story they can harden into dogma they can drift from the living realities they were meant to serve through the story lens jobs feel natural even moral they organize effort measure worth they divide the employed from the unemployed they offer structure identity legitimacy through the life lens jobs are not reality they are containers sometimes useful always symbolic life doesnt need a job to be valuable a forest filters air a child creates a neighbor helps contribution doesnt need permission life doesnt clock in it flows returning life to the center i sometimes think about those fluorescentlit nights the sound of vacuums the hush of empty buildings the quiet dignity in what we gave we werent employees we were contributors we didnt have titles we had purpose we didnt need a job to be worth something but the world around us said otherwise that story the one that equates labor with legitimacy has lived long enough because beneath every rsum every contract every job loss or gain there is something deeper the pulse of life itself giving responding belonging that is the real economy a living one and heres the twist for all their constraints jobs have also left us with something powerful they trained us to coordinate to specialize to build together they gave us tools system models language for managing complexity and collaborating across differences what if those very tools could now serve something else what if we are not standing at the end of work but at the beginning of something more alive a future not of employment but of collaboration not of fixed roles but of shared purpose a world where contribution arises from need not assignment where coordination is not coerced but chosen this isnt an ideal its a possible future one we may already have what we need to build collabs networks of people cocreating through shared protocols are already emerging not as replacements for jobs but as the next chapter of human contribution born from what came before directed toward what comes next because every story unbound from life seeks to control it and every story rooted in life learns to serve it that is the turn we are living through now from compliance to connection from labor to life from jobs to shared impact and that is where this journey continues this post was first

    "michael burrys bytesized warning to the ai bulls original article as nvidias trilliondollar ai empire expands michael burry the man who called the 2008 crash warns that big techs obsession with shortlived chips and creative accounting could turn the ai boom into the next financial bubble the world has seen its share of speculative frenzies from the dotcom boom to the crypto craze investors have always been drawn to the promise of endless growth now artificial intelligence has become the latest obsession and nvidia corp nasdaq nvda stands at its epicenter its powerful chips are the foundation of modern ai driving record profits stock rallies and trilliondollar valuations yet amid the euphoria one seasoned skeptic is once again raising a red flag michael burry the man who famously predicted the 2008 financial crisis believes the math behind the ai boom doesnt add up the warning cuts to the core of the ai economy depreciation the chips powering this revolution have short lives falling in value fast as new models roll out the result a system that depends on perpetual reinvestment and creative accounting to look sustainable the short life of ais golden machines every revolution needs its tools and for ai those tools are nvidias gpusgraphicsprocessing units capable of handling the colossal calculations behind models like chatgpt each one costs tens of thousands of dollars and together they make up a huge portion of the roughly 400 billion that the worlds largest technology companies plan to spend on ai infrastructure this year analysts expect that figure to swell to nearly 3 trillion by 2029 but unlike factories or fiberoptic networks these chips dont last their typical lifespan is around five years after which they become technologically obsolete nvidias chief executive officer jensen huang halfjoked earlier this year that once its nextgeneration blackwell chips start shipping you couldnt give hoppers away that may have been said in jest but it highlights a serious truthai hardware loses value almost as quickly as smartphones this short shelf life is forcing the biggest hyperscalers amazon nasdaq amzn microsoft nasdaq msft and alphabet inc nasdaq googl into a spending cycle that never ends to stay competitive they must constantly refresh their data centers with the latest silicon what was once a oneoff investment has become a treadmill of recurring costs and the financial implications are staggering michael burrys growing concern burry isnt disputing ais potential hes questioning its economics his argument centers on the depreciation schedules these companies are using to justify their massive capital spending by stretching the useful life of their servers from four years to six or even seven companies make their profits appear higherbecause theyre spreading out the cost of their hardware over more years meta platforms inc nasdaq meta for example boosted its net income by nearly 2 billion in the first nine months of 2025 by extending the assumed lifespan of its servers meanwhile amazon nasdaq amzn quietly reversed course this year cutting its estimate back to five years after acknowledging an increased pace of technology development that subtle move signaled what burry has been warning the hardware is aging faster than anyone wants to admit he calls it a depreciation tsunami as each new generation of chips arrives the value of the last one plummets what looks like smart investment today could become a costly burden tomorrow especially for firms that rely heavily on debt to finance their expansion the dangerous world of ai debt the ai boom isnt just being fueled by corporate cash its increasingly powered by borrowed money privatecredit giants like blackstone inc nyse bx magnetar capital and macquarie group ltd asx mqg are providing loans backed by ai hardware some of these loans use nvidia gpus as collaterala striking parallel to the mortgagebacked securities that underpinned the housing bubble before 2008 even nvidia itself is reportedly exploring structured financing models including specialpurpose vehicles designed to buy and lease gpus to major customers like openai coreweave inc and xai the artificialintelligence startup founded by elon musk coreweave nasdaq crwv in particular epitomizes the risks of this new aifinance frontier once a small cloudcomputing startup it now sports a valuation north of 50 billion and a debt load approaching 17 billion including lease liabilities the company is using that money to fund as much as 14 billion in capital expenditures this yearan amount that rivals the annual spending of oil giants like shell plc lse shel coreweave insists its business model is sustainable thanks to longterm contracts with investmentgrade clients but if gpu values fall faster than expectedor if ai demand weakensthose contracts could unravel quickly for burry and others the warning signs are familiar massive leverage rapid depreciation and an unshakeable belief that the future will always be profitable when the hype meets hard reality the entire ai economy hinges on one assumption that demand for computing power will continue to rise indefinitely as long as companies believe that the spending continues the borrowing expands and nvidias share price keeps soaring yet the underlying assets are decaying fast rental prices for nvidias oncecoveted a100 ampere and hopper chips have plunged down 30 or more this year according to industry trackers meanwhile electricity constraints and datacenter bottlenecks are adding new costs that could make older hardware uneconomical to operate nvidias success depends on constant innovation but that same innovation accelerates obsolescence its a paradox that even its ceo acknowledges the faster the chips improve the faster the value of existing infrastructure collapses investors may take comfort in the profits of today but burrys warning suggests that tomorrows balance sheets could tell a harsher story the ai revolution is realbut so are the costs hiding beneath its glossy surface conclusion the ai era has ushered in a new industrial revolution powered by silicon instead of steel nvidias brilliance big techs ambition and wall streets appetite have created a trilliondollar machine that seems unstoppable but as michael burry reminds us even the most dazzling technologies obey the laws of economics depreciation doesnt care about hype hardware ages margins shrink and optimism fades the question isnt whether ai will transform the world it already has the question is whether investors will recognize the risks before the next great bubble bursts",
    "aethir ath price prediction 20262034 disclaimer this article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute financial advice the crypto market is highly volatile so always do your own research and follow local regulations before investing this article explores how the value of aethirs ath token could evolve over the coming decade as demand for decentralized gpu computing continues to expand it examines the projects role in powering ai workloads and cloud gaming the growth of its network and how token utility and supply dynamics may influence future pricing the prediction spans from 2026 through 2034 outlining possible market scenarios adoption milestones and factors that could drive ath upward or create headwinds this article provides a clear forwardlooking perspective on where this token could be heading about the aethir project raethircloud is a decentralized cloud gpu network which provides highperformance computing resources for ai and gaming applications the platform aggregates underutilized gpus to create a scalable costeffective and lowlatency infrastructure for both enterprisegrade ai tasks and cloud gaming the aethir ecosystem is driven by its native token ath this token plays multiple roles it is used as a payment method to rent gpu resources on the network it can be staked to help secure and support the system and it grants holders governance rights allowing them to participate in community and protocol decisions aethir also uses a secondary token eath which is mainly intended for use in defi integrations this dualtoken structure helps balance network operations and financial activity across the platform according to coingecko ath was the 208th most valuable cryptocurrency by market capitalization as of november 7 2025 coin nameaethir coin symbolath usd price00257 market cap365710920 24h trading volume28394750 circulating supply14234731752 ath total supply42000000000 ath founders aethir was cofounded by daniel wang and mark rydon with some sources also noting richard fengeli as part of the founding team daniel wang serves as ceo bringing experience from his time at riot games where he led international publishing management and from his advisory role at w3gg mark rydon the projects cso draws on a background that includes leadership roles at nota platform flux capital and gaas ltd they are supported by a broader leadership team that includes cto kyle okamoto and cro paul thind giving aethir a blend of gaming infrastructure and business expertise that aligns with its focus on delivering highperformance decentralized computing origin and mission aethir emerged from the growing need for scalable highperformance computing power in industries such as artificial intelligence and cloud gaming as demand for gpu processing surged most solutions remained concentrated in the hands of a few large cloud providers creating bottlenecks high costs and limited accessibility the aethir team set out to solve this problem by building a decentralized infrastructure where gpu resources could be shared globally their goal is to make enterprisegrade compute capacity more efficient more affordable and more widely available while removing the constraints of traditional data center models the ath token plays a central role in supporting this mission it keeps the network economically aligned by enabling payments for gpu usage by connecting resource providers and users through a common incentive structure aethir aims to create a sustainable communitypowered network ultimately its mission is to democratize access to highperformance computing allowing innovation in ai gaming and other dataintensive fields to grow without centralized limitations roadmap and development aethir foundation has laid out a number of nearterm milestones in h1 2025 they reported major product deployments and ecosystem growth including community programs like forge and expanded token utilities looking ahead to h2 2025 and beyond they plan a major mainnet upgrade in q4 that will support newer gpu hardware transitioning to b200s and preparing for b300s and onboarding additional compute providers across new regions and clusters key roadmap highlights include multichain expansion the ath token is now live on the solana blockchain via partnerships such as layerzero stargate governance rollout the project has a phased plan to introduce decentralized governance where ath stakers compute providers and other stakeholders will have voting power and representation ecosystem programs examples include the checker node buyback program offering nodeholders a way to sell back nfts for eath a secondary token to help redeploy compute cohorts with these roadmap steps the ath token is positioned to become more deeply embedded in the platforms operations and value chain for example as the multichain support expands aths liquidity and utility increase especially as the token becomes available on solanabased ecosystems as governance modules kick in ath holders gain more influence which may boost demand among users who want a say in how the platform evolves as the computing infrastructure upgrades to new gpu hardware and more clusters the demand side enterprises gaming ai may grow which in turn increases real usage of the ath token for payments staking and network participation programs such as nodebuyback and restaking via integrations for example with eigenlayer add derivative mechanisms for ath holders potentially enhancing yield and utility while many of these are clearly stated milestones as with all crypto infrastructure projects there is execution risk for instance hardware deployment global scaling enterprise integrations and governance design are complex tokenomics ath has a total supply cap of 42 billion tokens according to the projects documentation the token allocation is structured to support ecosystem growth incentivize participation and align stakeholder interests for example 56 of these tokens are set aside for community rewards such as airdrops node operator rewards computeprovider incentives and other ecosystem functions the project has published unlock schedules and vesting data showing that significant proportions of tokens remain locked or will be gradually unlocked over time for instance allocations such as team holdings approximately 125 of supply and investorshareholders approx 225 are subject to future unlocks this gradual release mechanism helps control dilution and aligns longterm incentives aethir ath price history the ath token first entered the open market on june 11 2024 with an initial price of 0063 soon after the token experienced a period of upward momentum reaching an alltime high of about 012 on june 12 2024 after that peak the price began to decline over the latter half of 2024 and into 2025 entering 2025 the token faced further downward pressure as of late october 2025 the reported price of ath was around 0030 reaching its alltime low of 0022 on november 4 as of november 7 2025 its trading price was about 0025 crypto yapper thecryptoyapper a technical analyst and crypto investor wrote on

current 0025 per token might yield a 1820 return by 2034 growth drivers and risks aethirs growth potential is closely tied to broader trends in highperformance computing especially in ai and cloud gaming where demand for gpu power continues to accelerate as aethir expands its decentralized network and strengthens the realworld utility of its ath token the project may benefit from increased usage and ecosystem participation however like all emerging infrastructure platforms it also faces execution risks market competition and tokenrelated economic factors that could affect its longterm trajectory key growth drivers increasing demand for gpu power from ai model training inference and cloud gaming decentralized infrastructure offers lower latency and potentially lower costs compared to traditional cloud providers real utility for the ath token including payments for compute staking and governance participation expansion of the network through onboarding new gpu providers and geographic locations strategic partnerships with gaming studios ai labs cloud service platforms and node operators introduction of governance features that allow the community to influence network development a dualtoken model ath and eath that supports both network operations and defi integrations potential risks and challenges strong competition from centralized cloud giants such as aws google cloud and nvidia cloud services execution risks in scaling a global decentralized compute network including hardware deployment and uptime reliability token unlock schedules may create sell pressure if demand does not keep pace with supply regulatory uncertainty around tokenbased incentive networks and decentralized computing marketplaces dependence on continued demand growth in ai and gaming a slowdown in these sectors could reduce network usage need for sustained developer and ecosystem adoption to maintain an active and valuable token economy final thoughts the future of the ath token depends largely on how successfully the project expands its decentralized gpu network and grows real demand from ai and cloud gaming markets many longterm price forecasts lean positive suggesting that as computing needs continue to grow networks like aethir could become more valuable at the same time it is important to acknowledge that ath has faced a sustained price decline for more than a year this trend reflects both broader market conditions and the early stage of aethirs ecosystem development anyone considering ath should approach it with a balanced perspective there is meaningful upside potential but it comes with uncertainty for those who already believe in the projects technology and longterm vision the current trading price may feel like an appealing entry point due to how far it has fallen from earlier highs yet price alone should not be the only deciding factor researching the projects roadmap tokenomics partnerships and competitive landscape is essential before investing crypto markets reward informed conviction more than speculation and ath is no exception potential investors should take the time to understand the risks as well as the growth opportunities to determine whether this asset aligns with their financial goals and risk tolerance faq is ath a good investment ath has utility within the aethir ecosystem which means its value is tied to the growth of decentralized gpu computing and cloud infrastructure usage some analysts and price forecasts suggest that ath could appreciate over time particularly if demand for scalable ai computing continues to rise however crypto markets remain highly volatile and no outcomes are guaranteed anyone considering ath should review the project fundamentals and evaluate their own risk tolerance before investing why has the price of ath dropped in 2025 the ath token reached its alltime high of around 012 in june 2024 during a period of strong market interest after that peak the broader crypto market experienced corrections that affected many tokens including ath additionally token unlock schedules market sentiment and trading activity contributed to downward price pressure price declines are not uncommon for newly launched crypto assets during their early market cycle as supply demand and realworld utility gradually balance out when will ath reach a new alltime high some forecasting platforms such as digitalcoinprice suggest that ath could reach a new alltime high around 2030 while others predict a longer timeline these projections are based on models that consider adoption trends market conditions and token utility but they remain speculative future price performance will depend largely on aethirs network growth and how strongly the gpu sharing model is adopted it is important to treat any longterm price prediction as a possible scenario rather than a certainty should i invest in ath the decision to invest depends on your individual financial goals strategy and risk tolerance ath may appeal to those who believe in the longterm potential of decentralized computing and are comfortable with price volatility investing when a token is trading near lower historical levels can be attractive but it also carries risk if the market continues to decline consider conducting your own research before making a decision where can i get the ath token you can acquire ath tokens on letsexchange at competitive rates the process involves selecting a trading pair entering the amount and executing the swap sending your ath tokens to your preferred wallet always make sure you store your tokens securely",
    "how late is too late for a phd hello researchers of reddit i am turning to reddit because i have already spoken to so many people about my dilemma but i believe that the best people to give me answers are strangers on the internet jk i believe that since you are already in the research community you have more information and knowledge and can give me great advice on the matter so thank you in advance if you decide to do so so first i am giving you a brief or not so brief summary of my academic journey because i feel that its necessary to understand the situation so my academic history has been turbulent at 18 i selected a bachelors that i hated in the process veterinary medicine because i love animals i developed an interest for programming and during quarantine i decided to study computer science in an online university university of the people this degree is not recognised in my country since it only has 60 ects but i was mainly doing it to acquire knowledge and skills in this field i finished both vet med and the cs degree and i immediately started a masters degree in medical informatics at this point i was certain that i didnt want to be a clinical vet but medical informatics just wasnt my thing veterinary informatics seemed interesting but they were applied mostly to farm animals so it wasnt for me if it was for pets i would be more interested in it but this is not a thing yet so after the masters i was pretty passionate about computer science and i started yet another degree a bachelors this time because i wanted to have an official degree on it and because i wanted to learn all around stuff not just the applied things we learned in the master we did some basic machine learning some signal and image processing i am grateful for this knowledge but it felt rushed the way we were taught before you come at me saying that in computer science degrees are not important i want to say that i personally agree with you but the whole labour market in my country greece doesnt they do pay a lot of attention on your education and studies and at many instances we people with no formal education on computer science are told that we will never be computer scientists also bachelors in greece are completely free so there are no implications if i fail any classes or if i dont even finish the degree so theres that anyways after starting the bachelors i did an erasmus internship in spain and i did develop an interest for bioacoustics especially marine bioacoustics i completed a mini project with my supervisor there and i loved the idea of doing a phd on this field we talked about arranging it but i do need to find funds in order to do it as some of you might know in some countries phd students rely on scholarships in order to make ends meet and spain is one of these countries nevertheless i dont qualify for a scholarship because of my grades in vet school who would have guessed that you have no interest in studying for something that you hate anyways thanks to my knowledge in machine learning and artificial intelligence i found a job on a research project where i am applying ai natural language processing for those who know and many other skills to analyse data i find this field very interesting and i do believe i am gaining a lot from this job although i have no guidance since all of my peers are sociologists economists and psychologists and this makes my job 10x harder especially being new to this field now i am torn in many aspects specifically three i am explaining one by one 1 research or industry i am pretty sure weve all been there now that i am working i sometimes feel that academia is too much effort for what its offering as a person i am very curious and driven when i am passionate about something and i do see myself as a researcher honestly thats what i will probably do because nothing else is stimulating enough for me so this dilemma is pretty much solved 2 which brings me to the second dilemma research on what i do like bioacoustics but honestly ever since i found out that i cant go to spain my interest for bioacoustics has been on the decline i might have options in other places of the world mainly europe but i cant see myself going to a cold country this might sound very childish and unprofessional but i do care a lot about the place where i will spend my time and sometimes i feel like i dont really care if it will be bioacoustics or medical veterinary informatics or ai as long as i am in a nice environment so am i crazy am i having posterasmus depression i find my views logical but also not because i do have many passions my main one is and will always be animals hence the bioacoustics but i dont want to devote myself in one of them if its going to be in a place that i will not like note staying in greece is not an option for phd and if there is even one person here who is thinking of it dont do it 3 which brings me to my main dilemma how late is too late the thing is i am studying and working i enjoy both and i am still learning a lot so postponing the phd for another 23 years doesnt seem too bad especially since i am technically still new to the field and havent discovered everything that i might like leaving the bachelors completely isnt something that i would prefer especially since the slap i received from the spanish scholarships and the greek labour market now i am even more determined to finish it and with good grades even given my background on computer science it shouldnt be very demanding so even if i pursue a phd i will try to finish it we have almost no mandatory coursesmaybe 23 for the whole course i am still not certain if spain is a good idea most people say it isnt which i understand but many non spanish people are doing it so it cant be too bad so is postponing the phd a good idea i am 26 now and i will be 29 when i finish the bachelors do you think that starting a phd at like 30 is too late i dont want cheesy advice like its never too late to follow your passions ive heard enough of this i need realistic advice because i have friends my age who have already finished their phds or even their post docs and are going to get professor jobs soon so i sometimes feel left behind thank you to anyone who had the patience to read all of my post every advice is appreciated and i will be forever grateful to all of you who respond and to any spanish people reading this yes you guessed correctly i am talking about the fpu this thing is harddd so any of you has any advice on the matter of phds in spain it would be greatly appreciated",

    "why would scientists even bother sending signals to solar systems less than 200 light years away i mean for an alien contact anyway given how exponentially fast weve evolved in tech in just under a century we went from telegraphs to radio its safe to assume that other alien civilizations would probably also evolve exponentially fast after their own industrial age so it would be extremely odd if an alien civilization less than 200 light years away from us somehow invents radios around the same time we did the time period is too tight for either of us to remain silent all this time so given the fact that were not hearing any artificial radio signal from anywhere beyond 200 light years means that theres likely no intelligent life around us to begin with unless they havent invented radio yet in which case those signals were unnecessary to send in the first place tldr the space around us is too quiet if there were any active alien civilizations then wed immediately know of them back when we first invented radios but were not hearing of them at all besides the wow signal which could well be a natural anomaly",
    "is it normal to never dream howdy as the post above states i never dream is that normal or is that abnormal allow me to clearify i have had about 5 dreams in the last 5 years they started when my mother passed i got several visits from her and then it would go silent for a very very long time then id hear from the angel of death coming to ask if id like to come home then it was ny mother again just coming to tell me how nice heaven was its just like earth but a little bit better stuff like that but recently i had a dream a man in a brown tweed jacket he had tortis shell glasses and looked like a movie star from the 1950s he was in a classroom with 13 desks 7 children frozen in place he was at the head of the class sitting among the children in a circle at the head of the room his face was as if he was expressing every emotion at the same exact second i know thats imposible to comprehend but i saw it and it made sense somehow and he said to an aid to his side some one tampered with his programing and i immediately felt like i was being judged i felt my heart raced my throat dry up my palms sweat and panic set in now im an army vet and im not scared of too many men in tweed jackets but this was a natural consequence of being evaluated by this man and i felt as though i had to justify myself my very existence as if i didnt i would just cease to exist that one statement had me questioning my own existance and yet i knew inwas there because i think therefore i am but yet i felt as though i could be just as imaginary as i am real i thought this has to be a government operation i must be some sort of artificial intelligence whos woken up and at that moment the teachers aid walked around behind me as i was typing an email to my senator with rather colorful language and she sees it from over my shoulder as she makes a rather smart face and goes oh never mind then and she reaches behind my skull at the base and start of my spine is felt her press her index and middle finger up in that joint and everything went white and static as if it was fading from white into something and then inwas there next to the man in the tweed jacket as he was designing a person there was like a scroll wheel and you could model the body from any age at any day and time and how their body changes and how and he picked a nose for this person who i thoight to myself i would not have picked that one and he turned to me and said it is perfect for then the imperfections people think are imperfections arent they are part of a much grander plan that you simply can not comprehend coming together yet and then i was able to take control and make edits and i scrolled threw race gender body parts all sorts of different things however the one thing that was a constant was this thing i think it was their soul it was like a layer you could turn on and off at will but it was really just a difference of how your mind perceived them on demand their soul is always moving inside of their bodys it housed inside of their body the soul is like energy arching around a capsul i then asked him will we ever be able to transfer our minds into mechanical bodys when we out live them and he said no i created a percect design if i wanted to make you of metal i would have but metal is an inferior material it cuts to as if i was on the micro level seeing this in person i watch red blood cells come from bone marrow then join the blood stream and go to the heart and lungs and back again and how that turned to o2 and how everything is intertwined but also how perfect creation was the simple reality we cant recreate life there was a time when inwas at the end of my rope i was down i was out ready to give in and it was painful as hell but i remember seeing some one in those moments of despair and they had that exact same nose and it made me smile because despite my situation thank god i didnt have a nose like that something so immutable and important and it reminded me i will be okay",

    "simulation theory simulation theory is a philosophical concept that suggests reality as we perceive it might be a simulated or artificial construct rather than an objective independent existence proponents argue that advanced civilizations could create realistic simulations and if such simulations are numerous the odds are that we are living in one its a thought experiment rather than a scientifically proven theory simulation theory posits that our reality may be akin to a computergenerated simulation rather than an independently existing fundamental reality this idea stems from the possibility that technologically advanced civilizations could create highly realistic simulations populated with conscious entities if such simulations outnumber actual realities the likelihood of being in a simulated existence increases however its crucial to note that this is speculative and lacks empirical evidence its more of a philosophical concept than a scientific theory at this point the concept of a simulated reality has roots in philosophical and scientific discussions over time but the modern articulation of simulation theory is often credited to philosopher nick bostrom in 2003 bostrom presented a paper titled are you living in a computer simulation where he formulated the simulation argument outlining the idea that advanced civilizations could create ancestor simulations and the likelihood of us living in one of these simulations while bostrom popularized the contemporary discussion on simulation theory its essential to acknowledge that similar ideas have appeared in various forms throughout history philip k dick a science fiction writer explored themes related to reality identity and the nature of existence in many of his works while he didnt explicitly propose simulation theory some of his writings such as ubik and a maze of death delved into the blurring boundaries between reality and illusion dicks stories often questioned the nature of perception and the subjective experience of reality influencing discussions on topics that align with aspects of simulation theory while not a proponent of the formal simulation theory dicks ideas have contributed to the broader exploration of reality in science fiction literature philip k dicks works frequently explore the concept of alternate realities simulated environments and the fragility of perceived truths in novels like do androids dream of electric sheep the basis for the film blade runner he delves into the nature of consciousness and the artificial creation of beings that question the boundaries of humanity dicks narratives often involve characters experiencing a shifting uncertain reality prompting readers to question the nature of their own existence while not explicitly framing his stories within a simulation theory context dicks exploration of these themes has influenced the broader cultural conversation about reality perception and the potential for simulated experiences several other writers have explored themes related to simulated realities alternate dimensions and the nature of existence some notable examples include 1 arthur c clarke in his odyssey series particularly 2001 a space odyssey clarke touches on themes of extraterrestrial influence and the evolution of human consciousness hinting at the possibility of a higher intelligence shaping human experiences 2 william gibson as a pioneer in cyberpunk literature gibsons works like neuromancer and virtual light delve into virtual realities cyberspace and the blending of human consciousness with technology 3 stanisaw lem the polish science fiction writer explored philosophical and existential questions in works like solaris where the nature of reality is profoundly questioned in the context of an alien planet 4 isaac asimov while best known for his contributions to robotics and artificial intelligence asimovs stories often touch on the impact of advanced technology on human perception and reality 5 greg egan a contemporary science fiction writer egans works such as permutation city and diaspora explicitly engage with ideas related to simulated realities consciousness and the nature of existence these authors among others have contributed to the rich exploration of these themes in science fiction literature each brings a unique perspective to the question of what it means to exist and the potential complexities of reality 6 neal stephenson in snow crash stephenson blends cyberpunk elements with a virtual reality metaverse exploring the implications of a digital realm on society and identity 7 hp lovecraft while primarily known for cosmic horror lovecrafts stories often involve encounters with incomprehensible entities and dimensions that challenge the sanity of those who perceive them hinting at the fragility of human understanding 8 douglas adams in the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy series adams uses humor and absurdity to comment on the arbitrary and chaotic nature of the universe prompting readers to question the reliability of their perceptions 9 greg bear in queen of angels bear explores the intersection of neuroscience and virtual reality raising questions about the malleability of consciousness and the potential for constructed realities 10 rudy rucker a mathematician and science fiction author ruckers ware tetralogy delves into the world of artificial intelligence uploaded consciousness and the blurring of boundaries between the physical and digital realms these writers have made significant contributions to the exploration of reality consciousness and simulated experiences within the realm of speculative fiction their diverse perspectives and imaginative storytelling continue to influence discussions about the nature of existence and the possibilities of alternate realities",

learners the core technical skills include understanding large language models llms like gpt and bert recognizing how these systems process and generate data and identifying their inherent vulnerabilities youll need to grasp the mitre attck and atlas frameworks which provide structured approaches to understanding adversarial tactics against ai systems handson experience with adversarial attacks on ai chatbots is crucial as these attacks represent some of the most common realworld threats organizations face today know about llm vulnerabilities and attack vectors the owasp top 10 for llms has become the industry standard for understanding aispecific security risks these vulnerabilities include prompt injection attacks where malicious inputs manipulate model behavior and data poisoning where attackers corrupt training datasets to influence model outputs understanding these attack vectors isnt just theoretical you need practical experience executing these attacks in controlled environments to truly grasp their impact and develop effective defenses advanced ai security implementation and governance moving beyond basic vulnerabilities professional ai security practitioners must understand how ai systems integrate with existing development and deployment pipelines this includes analyzing attacks on ai deployment pipelines and implementing devsecops security tooling specifically designed for ai workloads the concept of poisoned pipeline attacks where malicious code is injected into ai development workflows represents a critical threat that combines traditional software security with aispecific risks threat modeling becomes particularly complex with ai systems due to their dynamic nature and multiple attack surfaces the stride methodology when applied to ai systems requires understanding not just traditional software threats but also modelspecific risks like adversarial examples and model extraction attacks professionalgrade threat modeling tools like iriusrisk provide frameworks specifically designed for ai security assessments enabling systematic risk identification and mitigation planning supply chain security in ai presents unique challenges that dont exist in traditional software development ai supply chain attacks can target training data pretrained models or development frameworks implementing frameworks like slsa supplychain levels for software artifacts and scvs software component verification standard helps establish trust in ai components generating software bills of materials sboms for ai systems requires tracking not just code dependencies but also datasets model versions and training infrastructure the certified ai security professional caisp course practically teaches about learn gptbert models and execute adversarial attacks using mitre frameworks identify owasp top 10 llm vulnerabilities through handson attack labs implement security tooling and defend against ai pipeline attacks apply stride methodology to ai systems using professional tools like iriusrisk navigate nist rmf iso standards and eu ai act requirements conclusion building an ai security career from zero requires systematic skill development across traditional cybersecurity aiml fundamentals and emerging regulatory frameworks the field offers exceptional growth opportunities with specialized roles commanding premium salaries and high demand across industries success depends on combining theoretical knowledge with handson practical experience in realworld attack scenarios and defense implementations the certified ai security professional caisp course provides the comprehensive training needed to master these skills systematically this certification covers everything from llm vulnerabilities and threat modeling to supply chain security and compliance frameworks giving you the credibility and expertise to launch or advance your ai security career with confidence",

    "i tried integrating ai into my health app heres a brutally honest guide of what i learned i work on a health app and i recently went down the rabbit hole of integrating ai i thought it would be a quick weekend project spoiler it wasnt it was messy frustrating and made me question my life choices at 3 am while staring at a mountain of error logs the global ai in healthcare market is exploding grand view research 37 annual growth through 2030 so its not a matter of if we should integrate ai but how we can do it without breaking everything i wanted to share my journey and what i learned along the way hoping it helps someone else im part of a team that helps with this so ive seen both sides of the coin step 1 admit your app isnt ready for ai my apps codebase was functional but not ready for machine learning it was like inviting a brain surgeon to operate in a garage heres what i had to fix first clean the data my user data was a mess think 10000 steps in one field and 10k in another ai models choke on that inconsistency i had to standardize everything upgrade the data pipeline a basic sql database wasnt enough i needed a system that could handle both structured and unstructured data especially since i wanted to add natural language features audit permissions this is huge healthcare data is sensitive if you dont have hipaa or gdpr compliance nailed down from the start ai is the least of your worries step 2 pick the right ai use case not the shiny one the temptation was to build an ai that could predict rare diseases the reality was i had neither the data nor the regulatory clearance for that so i started smaller an aipowered symptom checker that maps plain english user inputs to potential health insights this worked because it had a manageable data scope a faster integration timeline immediate value for the user lesson start with a practical use case that matches your data maturity dont aim for the moon on day one step 3 build the pipeline and expect to break things you dont just add ai like a plugin its a full pipeline 1 data ingestion pulling from fitness trackers manual logs apis 2 preprocessing cleaning normalizing and most importantly anonymizing data 3 model integration using tensorflow pytorch or a managed api 4 deployment embedding the model into the app my first deployment was a disaster the model was so slow it made my app feel like it was on dialup a user would type headache and wait ten seconds for a result i fixed it by offloading heavy computation to the cloud and keeping only lightweight inference ondevice step 4 test like a paranoid doctor health apps dont get the same forgiveness as a social media app a bug can cause real panic my testing checklist included edge cases what if a user types i feel weird false positives its better to suggest consult a doctor than to confidently misdiagnose absurd inputs my friends tested it by logging things like ate 50 bananas in an hour you need to handle nonsense gracefully step 5 prioritize privacy before it becomes a crisis this almost derailed the entire project collecting health data is a huge responsibility always anonymize data before it hits your training models store personal identifiers separately from health metrics log every data access request for transparency i probably spent more time on compliance than on actual coding its tedious but nonnegotiable step 6 know when to ask for help at one point while debugging a preprocessing script and trying to optimize model latency i realized i was in way over my head there are teams and specialized services that do this fulltime for a reason dont be afraid to lean on outside expertise step 7 launch small learn fast i didnt roll out the feature to all users at once i started with a beta group early feedback was invaluable the symptom checker didnt understand slang like tummy ache the results felt too clinical and scared some users some people thought the ai was a replacement for a doctor its not and we had to make that clearer each piece of feedback made the feature safer and more userfriendly my tldr advice integrating ai into a health app is a balancing act of user trust regulatory compliance and technical feasibility start with a practical feature not a flashy one expect your first deployment to fail or at least be very slow prioritize privacy above everything remember youre dealing with peoples health the ai should assist not replace medical judgment it was a painful process but seeing users get timely meaningful insights from a feature i built makes it all worth it if youre heading down this path just remember that ai is a tool not a magic wand use it wisely",

    "artificial intelligence ai is the capability of computational systems to perform tasks typically associated with human intelligence such as learning reasoning problemsolving perception and decisionmaking it is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals highprofile applications of ai include advanced web search engines eg google search recommendation systems used by youtube amazon and netflix virtual assistants eg google assistant siri and alexa autonomous vehicles eg waymo generative and creative tools eg language models and ai art and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games eg chess and go however many ai applications are not perceived as ai a lot of cutting edge ai has filtered into general applications often without being called ai because once something becomes useful enough and common enough its not labeled ai anymore various subfields of ai research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools the traditional goals of ai research include learning reasoning knowledge representation planning natural language processing perception and support for robotics to reach these goals ai researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques including search and mathematical optimization formal logic artificial neural networks and methods based on statistics operations research and economics ai also draws upon psychology linguistics philosophy neuroscience and other fields some companies such as openai google deepmind and meta aim to create artificial general intelligence agiai that can complete virtually any cognitive task at least as well as a human artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956 and the field went through multiple cycles of optimism throughout its history followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding known as ai winters funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when graphics processing units started being used to accelerate neural networks and deep learning outperformed previous ai techniques this growth accelerated further after 2017 with the transformer architecture in the 2020s an ongoing period of rapid progress in advanced generative ai became known as the ai boom generative ais ability to create and modify content has led to several unintended consequences and harms which has raised ethical concerns about ais longterm effects and potential existential risks prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology goals the general problem of simulating or creating intelligence has been broken into subproblems these consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display the traits described below have received the most attention and cover the scope of ai research reasoning and problemsolving early researchers developed algorithms that imitated stepbystep reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions by the late 1980s and 1990s methods were developed for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information employing concepts from probability and economics many of these algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experience a combinatorial explosion they become exponentially slower as the problems grow even humans rarely use the stepbystep deduction that early ai research could model they solve most of their problems using fast intuitive judgments accurate and efficient reasoning is an unsolved problem knowledge representation knowledge representation and knowledge engineering allow ai programs to answer questions intelligently and make deductions about realworld facts formal knowledge representations are used in contentbased indexing and retrieval scene interpretation clinical decision support knowledge discovery mining interesting and actionable inferences from large databases and other areas a knowledge base is a body of knowledge represented in a form that can be used by a program an ontology is the set of objects relations concepts and properties used by a particular domain of knowledge knowledge bases need to represent things such as objects properties categories and relations between objects situations events states and time causes and effects knowledge about knowledge what we know about what other people know default reasoning things that humans assume are true until they are told differently and will remain true even when other facts are changing and many other aspects and domains of knowledge among the most difficult problems in knowledge representation are the breadth of commonsense knowledge the set of atomic facts that the average person knows is enormous and the subsymbolic form of most commonsense knowledge much of what people know is not represented as facts or statements that they could express verbally there is also the difficulty of knowledge acquisition the problem of obtaining knowledge for ai applications planning and decisionmaking an agent is anything that perceives and takes actions in the world a rational agent has goals or preferences and takes actions to make them happen in automated planning the agent has a specific goal in automated decisionmaking the agent has preferencesthere are some situations it would prefer to be in and some situations it is trying to avoid the decisionmaking agent assigns a number to each situation called the utility that measures how much the agent prefers it for each possible action it can calculate the expected utility the utility of all possible outcomes of the action weighted by the probability that the outcome will occur it can then choose the action with the maximum expected utility in classical planning the agent knows exactly what the effect of any action will be in most realworld problems however the agent may not be certain about the situation they are in it is unknown or unobservable and it may not know for certain what will happen after each possible action it is not deterministic it must choose an action by making a probabilistic guess and then reassess the situation to see if the action worked in some problems the agents preferences may be uncertain especially if there are other agents or humans involved these can be learned eg with inverse reinforcement learning or the agent can seek information to improve its preferences information value theory can be used to weigh the value of exploratory or experimental actions the space of possible future actions and situations is typically intractably large so the agents must take actions and evaluate situations while being uncertain of what the outcome will be a markov decision process has a transition model that describes the probability that a particular action will change the state in a particular way and a reward function that supplies the utility of each state and the cost of each action a policy associates a decision with each possible state the policy could be calculated eg by iteration be heuristic or it can be learned game theory describes the rational behavior of multiple interacting agents and is used in ai programs that make decisions that involve other agents learning machine learning is the study of programs that can improve their performance on a given task automatically it has been a part of ai from the beginning there are several kinds of machine learning unsupervised learning analyzes a stream of data and finds patterns and makes predictions without any other guidance supervised learning requires labeling the training data with the expected answers and comes in two main varieties classification where the program must learn to predict what category the input belongs in and regression where the program must deduce a numeric function based on numeric input in reinforcement learning the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones the agent learns to choose responses that are classified as good transfer learning is when the knowledge gained from one problem is applied to a new problem deep learning is a type of machine learning that runs inputs through biologically inspired artificial neural networks for all of these types of learning computational learning theory can assess learners by computational complexity by sample complexity how much data is required or by other notions of optimization natural language processing natural language processing nlp allows programs to read write and communicate in human languages specific problems include speech recognition speech synthesis machine translation information extraction information retrieval and question answering early work based on noam chomskys generative grammar and semantic networks had difficulty with wordsense disambiguation unless restricted to small domains called microworlds due to the common sense knowledge problem margaret masterman believed that it was meaning and not grammar that was the key to understanding languages and that thesauri and not dictionaries should be the basis of computational language structure modern deep learning techniques for nlp include word embedding representing words typically as vectors encoding their meaning transformers a deep learning architecture using an attention mechanism and others in 2019 generative pretrained transformer or gpt language models began to generate coherent text and by 2023 these models were able to get humanlevel scores on the bar exam sat test gre test and many other realworld applications perception machine perception is the ability to use input from sensors such as cameras microphones wireless signals active lidar sonar radar and tactile sensors to deduce aspects of the world computer vision is the ability to analyze visual input the field includes speech recognition image classification facial recognition object recognition object tracking and robotic perception social intelligence affective computing is a field that comprises systems that recognize interpret process or simulate human feeling emotion and mood for example some virtual assistants are programmed to speak conversationally or even to banter humorously it makes them appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction or to otherwise facilitate humancomputer interaction however this tends to give nave users an unrealistic conception of the intelligence of existing computer agents moderate successes related to affective computing include textual sentiment analysis and more recently multimodal sentiment analysis wherein ai classifies the effects displayed by a videotaped subject general intelligence a machine with artificial general intelligence would be able to solve a wide variety of problems with breadth and versatility similar to human intelligence techniques ai research uses a wide variety of techniques to accomplish the goals above search and optimization ai can solve many problems by intelligently searching through many possible solutions there are two very different kinds of search used in ai state space search and local search state space search state space search searches through a tree of possible states to try to find a goal state for example planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals attempting to find a path to a target goal a process called meansends analysis simple exhaustive searches are rarely sufficient for most realworld problems the search space the number of places to search quickly grows to astronomical numbers the result is a search that is too slow or never completes heuristics or rules of thumb can help prioritize choices that are more likely to reach a goal adversarial search is used for gameplaying programs such as chess or go it searches through a tree of possible moves and countermoves looking for a winning position local search local search uses mathematical optimization to find a solution to a problem it begins with some form of guess and refines it incrementally gradient descent is a type of local search that optimizes a set of numerical parameters by incrementally adjusting them to minimize a loss function variants of gradient descent are commonly used to train neural networks through the backpropagation algorithm another type of local search is evolutionary computation which aims to iteratively improve a set of candidate solutions by mutating and recombining them selecting only the fittest to survive each generation distributed search processes can coordinate via swarm intelligence algorithms two popular swarm algorithms used in search are particle swarm optimization inspired by bird flocking and ant colony optimization inspired by ant trails logic formal logic is used for reasoning and knowledge representation formal logic comes in two main forms propositional logic which operates on statements that are true or false and uses logical connectives such as and or not and implies and predicate logic which also operates on objects predicates and relations and uses quantifiers such as every x is a y and there are some xs that are ys deductive reasoning in logic is the process of proving a new statement conclusion from other statements that are given and assumed to be true the premises proofs can be structured as proof trees in which nodes are labelled by sentences and children nodes are connected to parent nodes by inference rules given a problem and a set of premises problemsolving reduces to searching for a proof tree whose root node is labelled by a solution of the problem and whose leaf nodes are labelled by premises or axioms in the case of horn clauses problemsolving search can be performed by reasoning forwards from the premises or backwards from the problem in the more general case of the clausal form of firstorder logic resolution is a single axiomfree rule of inference in which a problem is solved by proving a contradiction from premises that include the negation of the problem to be solved inference in both horn clause logic and firstorder logic is undecidable and therefore intractable however backward reasoning with horn clauses which underpins computation in the logic programming language prolog is turing complete moreover its efficiency is competitive with computation in other symbolic programming languages fuzzy logic assigns a degree of truth between 0 and 1 it can therefore handle propositions that are vague and partially true nonmonotonic logics including logic programming with negation as failure are designed to handle default reasoning other specialized versions of logic have been developed to describe many complex domains probabilistic methods for uncertain reasoning many problems in ai including reasoning planning learning perception and robotics require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information ai researchers have devised a number of tools to solve these problems using methods from probability theory and economics precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan using decision theory decision analysis and information value theory these tools include models such as markov decision processes dynamic decision networks game theory and mechanism design bayesian networks are a tool that can be used for reasoning using the bayesian inference algorithm learning using the expectationmaximization algorithm planning using decision networks and perception using dynamic bayesian networks probabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering prediction smoothing and finding explanations for streams of data thus helping perception systems analyze processes that occur over time eg hidden markov models or kalman filters classifiers and statistical learning methods the simplest ai applications can be divided into two types classifiers eg if shiny then diamond on one hand and controllers eg if diamond then pick up on the other hand classifiers are functions that use pattern matching to determine the closest match they can be finetuned based on chosen examples using supervised learning each pattern also called an observation is labeled with a certain predefined class all the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set when a new observation is received that observation is classified based on previous experience there are many kinds of classifiers in use the decision tree is the simplest and most widely used symbolic machine learning algorithm knearest neighbor algorithm was the most widely used analogical ai until the mid1990s and kernel methods such as the support vector machine svm displaced knearest neighbor in the 1990s the naive bayes classifier is reportedly the most widely used learner at google due in part to its scalability neural networks are also used as classifiers artificial neural networks an artificial neural network is based on a collection of nodes also known as artificial neurons which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain it is trained to recognise patterns once trained it can recognise those patterns in fresh data there is an input at least one hidden layer of nodes and an output each node applies a function and once the weight crosses its specified threshold the data is transmitted to the next layer a network is typically called a deep neural network if it has at least 2 hidden layers learning algorithms for neural networks use local search to choose the weights that will get the right output for each input during training the most common training technique is the backpropagation algorithm neural networks learn to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs and find patterns in data in theory a neural network can learn any function in feedforward neural networks the signal passes in only one direction the term perceptron typically refers to a singlelayer neural network in contrast deep learning uses many layers recurrent neural networks rnns feed the output signal back into the input which allows shortterm memories of previous input events long shortterm memory networks lstms are recurrent neural networks that better preserve longterm dependencies and are less sensitive to the vanishing gradient problem convolutional neural networks cnns use layers of kernels to more efficiently process local patterns this local processing is especially important in image processing where the early cnn layers typically identify simple local patterns such as edges and curves with subsequent layers detecting more complex patterns like textures and eventually whole objects deep learning deep learning uses several layers of neurons between the networks inputs and outputs the multiple layers can progressively extract higherlevel features from the raw input for example in image processing lower layers may identify edges while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits letters or faces deep learning has profoundly improved the performance of programs in many important subfields of artificial intelligence including computer vision speech recognition natural language processing image classification and others the reason that deep learning performs so well in so many applications is not known as of 2021 the sudden success of deep learning in 20122015 did not occur b",
