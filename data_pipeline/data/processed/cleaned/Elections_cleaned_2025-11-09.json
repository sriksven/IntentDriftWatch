    "the life and times of octavia e butler 2025 in these times link the life and times of octavia e butler in a new biography susana m morris reflects on the devolution of american empire through the lens of butlers life by aina marzia 20251009 art by rachel k dooleyphotos by malcolm aliwire image leo alexander the summer before susana m morris turned 16 an age when she wasnt quite grown but not a kid anymore either she read octavia butlers 1993 novel parable of the sower first encountering the black teenage girl at its center as an adult reckoning with americas political climate morris describes trumps encouragement of violence against journalists and detractors as something right out of the 1998 sequel parable of the talents now a scholar of black feminism at georgia tech morris has taught the novel countless times noting that nearly every student reacts with the same question how did octavia know new admirers of butlers work might otherwise struggle to imagine the butler who faced rejection letters and once pawned her typewriter to pay bills before catching her big break years later in morris new biography positive obsession the life and times of octavia e butler she tries to answer that question tracing butlers life from the young introvert sometimes described as a kind of misanthrope who preferred her own company to her posthumous legacy as a literary mastermind whose oeuvre has become a centerpiece of black liberation for morris the biography also works as a dedication to blackness and an opportunity to understand her own existence as a black queer woman in the united states we learn about butlers writing from childhood in postwar pasadena calif through the black power movement and the reagan administration and into her last moments at age 58 in 2006 shadowed by the iraq war and war on terror butlers early awareness of power structures shifted her mindset into one that wondered whether those who didnt have much power could empower themselves and others and change the world morris describes how many adults attempted to discourage a young butler from pursuing a writing career and how she became known as a news junkie as early as age 13 fed by the 1960 election of president john f kennedy details from butlers upbringing manifest throughout her frequently dystopian work which routinely envisioned futures with black women at the center changing the course of human life and culture a 1951 fire that burned her grandmothers house is a mirror to the drug addicted pyros who enjoy lighting and watching fires that consume neighborhoods in parable of the sower in kindred a slave narrative that incorporates time travel butler hints at her mothers upbringing on a southern plantation asking us to reassess the legacy of american slavery wild seed an unapologetically weird novel and the fourth in the patternist series asks what it means to be human while kindred and her other novels speak to a mother and feminine black existence one that could hold the fate of humanity within it in the pantheon of literary icons positive obsession places butler alongside a museum of literary icons including audre lorde toni morrison and alice walker writers who like butler took on patriarchy white supremacy and other structures of power in dynamic ways that centered black womens experiences and intellectual contributions the title comes from an article butler wrote for essence in 1989 i was writing science fiction and fantasy for gods sake at that time nearly all professional science fiction writers were white men as much as i loved science fiction and fantasy what was i doing well whatever it was i couldnt stop positive obsession is about not being able to stop just because youre afraid and full of doubts positive obsession is dangerous its about not being able to stop at all whats special about the book is how closely it sits with butler in the throes of her obsession as she clanks away at her remington typewriter during time snatched from jobs in factories and laundries in the 1971 short story crossover she writes about a woman who is brought to the brink of insanity as she works in a factory new admirers of butlers work might otherwise struggle to imagine the butler who faced rejection letters and once pawned her typewriter to pay bills before catching her big break years later as an introvert and avid reader butlers young mind became a dreamscape other inspirations include for example her local library and grocerystore science fiction magazines we learn the telepathic humans from the patternist series for example were influenced by zenna hendersons 1961 novel pilgrimage which featured similar strong women characters and an alien telepathic force that spoke up about their unique struggles we also get notes from butlers journals and diaries which butler sometimes wrote in spanish or code to speak freely they frequently share butlers early interest in utopian societies as she wondered whether socialist or communist models could come to fruition as people will not live together without taking advantage of each other if they possibly can they will not stop considering themselves better because their skin is light the same journals reveal how butler was known by estelle her middle name in childhood since she and her mother share the name octavia and how she grappled with the weight of poverty isolation and frustration early in her career morris shows how butlers early financial struggles led her to publish the book survivor despite being a commentary on settler colonialism butler reveals that she regretted hastily accepting editors changes and publishing something that felt to her like bad writing positive obsession eloquently tells the story of octavia the trailblazer who simply wanted to write the kinds of work she wanted to read and for morris it works as an opportunity to reconnect with that young teenager first encountering a black girl hero in a book",

20th century intellectuals in the tapestry of modern islamic thought few figures shine as brightly as muhammad iqbal the philosopherpoet whose voice echoed far beyond the borders of british india to the people of pakistan he is the thinker who dreamed the dream of nationhood to the wider muslim world he is a spiritual revolutionary a poet of awakening who called upon the muslim ummah to rediscover its historical unity pride and divine purpose iqbal 18771938 was a poet philosopher politician and visionary thinker widely regarded as the spiritual founder of pakistan and one of the most influential muslim intellectuals of the 20th century known as allama iqbal the learned iqbal in south asia he wrote in persian and urdu blending islamic mysticism western philosophy and political

renaissance a place where muslims could rediscover the power of khudi the self that stands tall before god and history in 1932 muhammad iqbal visited cordoba in spain where he prayed and penned his famous poem about the lament of the great umayyad mosque in the city in this poem iqbal reminded muslims that empires fall dynasties vanish but the light of islamic faith that built the great mosque of cordoba lives on beyond time a voice for the muslim ummah the power of iqbals message was that it was never confined to one land writing in both urdu and persian he reached audiences from tehran to istanbul from kabul to cairo in iran he is revered as iqbalelahori placed alongside classical persian greats his admiration for maulana jalaluddin rumi whom he called his spiritual guide allowed him to enter the hearts of those who cherished sufi thought at a time when the muslim world was fractured by colonialism and internal divisions iqbal spoke of panislamic unity not as a political alliance alone but as a spiritual awakening he envisioned a world where muslims regardless of borders and languages would remember they were part of a single caravan bound by faith and destiny we are waves of the same sea leaves of the same tree the walls between us are illusions let them fall free though this verse is a poetic interpretation of his philosophy rather than a literal translation it captures the essence of iqbals call for unity a unity of hearts of purpose and intellect the call for selfhood and action through his passionate and eloquent poetry iqbal warned against stagnation urging muslims to rise above despair and reclaim their forgotten legacy of leadership and learning his iconic lines remain a rallying cry khudi ko kar buland itna ke har taqdeer se pehle khuda bande se khud poochhe bata teri raza kya hai here iqbal challenges the believer to elevate their character and soul until even destiny seeks their permission it is a philosophy not of resignation but of empowerment a bold reminder that faith is not passive submission but an active journey toward excellence today statues of the revolutionary poet muhammad iqbal stand in tehran his poetry is recited in turkey roads are named after him in kabul and dhaka conferences in central asia celebrate his thought and in pakistan he is a national icon where his words are etched into textbooks hearts and national memory iqbal did not merely write poetry he ignited movements he did not merely speak of freedom he breathed soul into it he called upon muslims to rise not in anger but in awareness to build not just empires of land but empires of intellect morality and islamic unity the poet still speaks iqbal never saw the creation of pakistan he died of a throat illness on april 21 1938 in lahore and was buried near the badshahi mosque but his legacy outlived him recognised as pakistans national poet his birthday november 9 is a public holiday known as iqbal day his thought influenced the pakistan movement iranian revolution thinkers and global muslim reform the iqbal academy pakistan preserves his works streets universities and airports across pakistan iran and beyond bear his name in an age where the muslim world continues to face strife and fragmentation iqbals voice remains hauntingly relevant he reminds us that true liberation begins within that nations crumble when their spirit fades and that unity is not born of slogans but of shared islamic purpose and moral awakening as we look across the modern landscape of the muslim world iqbals message returns like a timeless echo lift your gaze o traveller of faith you were not made to walk with your head bowed the caravan of the ummah waits rise and take your place among the builders of destiny in 1922 the british government tried to tame the revolutionary poet by granting him a knighthood and granting him the title sir after being appointed a knight bachelor by king george v iqbal nevertheless continued his scathing criticism of colonial rule and continued his calls for an intellectual and political awakening amongst the muslims of india and far beyond therefore there is no doubt that in remembering muhammad iqbal we do more than just honour a poet we revive a vision for the muslim ummah",

    "is there a reason why we think zohran wont ratfuck us just like all the other dsa backed candidates whenever i point out zohrans mistakes like calling cuba and venezuela a dictatorship and his statement this last october 7th people are like duh obviously hes not going to usher in a revolution thats not why were supporting him that isnt our position stop being a wrecker i get frustrated by this because its not my position that the prozohran people believe zohran is going to overthrow capitalism or whatever rather my position is hes probably going to be like the other progressive candidates in the democratic party prop up the system and not actually make any meaningful change on the ground everyone already knows why bernie and aoc suck they both ended up supporting israel when it mattered the most less attention is given to ilhan omar and rashida tlaib also dsabacked candidates since october 7th theyve rightly been criticizing israel and zionism as a whole but they are not antiimperialists tlaib supported the uighur genocide narrative and voted to give weapons to ukraine and taiwan omar also voted to give weapons to ukraine and taiwan i wont go so far to say that they are not meaningfully different from the us foreign policy establishment but are siding with the us government on many issues outside of the middle east and even in the middle east they arent that great omar and tlaib both praised assad getting replaced by al qaeda in syria and omar has some weird stances on turkey its cool that they are against the very worst iterations of us foreign policy genocide but im not seeing a meaningful difference on everything outside of that so lets bring this back to zohran in 2020 zohran tweeted a news article that announced a maoist politician in india in local elections and said we need more of this so i believe he knows whats up which is why i was so disappointed in the venezuela and cuba dictatorship remarks he knows the history of those countries and how us aggression has crippled them i dont believe he doesnt know any better and even if youre a true believer in democratic socialism and reject the leninist one party model that cuba operates under why call venezuela a dictatorship there are still opposition parties in venezuela that are openly anti chavezmaduro all of this is only made worse by the fact that were now openly attacking venezuela zohrans statements help manufacture consent for that ive seen people say well he had to say that because he was asked the question he couldnt just say nothing did he though hes a politician he can say deflect and say something like however you feel about the maduro and diaz we must stand against the trump administrations illegal and inhumane attacks and embargos agaisnt these countries and ive also seen people say it was a strategic move how is this strategic zohran was so successful because he put forth a genuinely progressive image and was bucking the establishment the type of people who are antivenezuela and anticuba arent going to be persuaded to vote for him because of a statement like that and so you may say well hes the mayor of new york he has no control over foreign policy what matters is how he runs the city first hes still knowingly manufacturing consent even if he follows it up with the blockadestrikes on the boats are wrong which to his credit he did say second if hes willing to capitulate on something that doesnt matter why do we think hes going to hold the line on things that do matter like taking on the rich in nyc i have no doubt that zohran will be a better mayor than cuomo would have been but why do we think hes going to be our guy on the actual administration of nyc hes already walked back his statements about the nypd ill actually give him some leeway on this because the nypd is basically a gang and they will physically fuck with you if you come down too hard on them like they did with de blasio but given that and his lukewarm foreign policy statements i really dont think hes going to make nyc a substantially better place hes already schmoozing with the establishment and donors like alex soros and sure he has to work within the system but given all of this i am struggling to understand where this belief that hes actually going to deliver comes from because he said nice things to be clear i live in nyc voted for zohran and even canvassed for him while knowing all of this i do not have the infantile disorder i agree with lenin that we need to meet people where they are at his election is a positive thing overall because it gets more people into leftwing politics and were breaking new ground here all the major demsoc politicians have only been legislators now were going to see someone with actual administrative power to do things but i believe so many people here have way too much misplaced faith in him and we need to be more critical about what he does instead of just dismissing all criticisms of him as wrecker behavior what is fundamentally different about zohran compared to bernie aoc tlaib and omar that warrants all this support also he got married in dubai",

    "prophecy from 2016 eerily correct this popped up as a facebook memory from 2016 a text that sarcasticallysatirically described the fictional day in 2029 when president trump passed away its jarring for me to see how many of this can already be the speed with which it all happened as well and by then people thought he would be a single term fluke you risked our future for that dad yesterday on june 12th 2029 president donald trump two days short of his 83rd birthday died peacefully in the white house just five months after winning a fourth term vice president sarah palin was immediately sworn in as his successor the announcement has shaken the country to its core provoking a quiet period of contemplation about the trump years and what comes next america has changed in ways that few believed possible when he was first elected in 2016 trump offered what many americans wanted he projected himself as a strong man who would turn back the clock and restore the country to what he thought was the greatness of the past in the 1950s and 1960s workingclass men in particular overwhelmingly supported trumps perplexing promise to return their manufacturing jobs and their middleclass lives as though they faced no new competition from women minorities and other countries those who understood the dangers to democracy that a man like trump represented had assumed that our system of checks and balances would keep him from going too far but they were wrong once in power trump accumulated more power with each passing year relying in part on a fiercely partisan congress and a compliant supreme court which included the three new members hed appointed those who disagreed with him including the press were slowly silenced by lawsuits threats personal attacks and imprisonment trump came to power in one of the nations most bizarre presidential elections it featured two widely unpopular major party candidates and two smaller party candidates hillary clinton trumps main competitor was widely expected to win the election according to polls and pundits across the spectrum trump however shocked the political world winning with just 46 percent of the vote after voters either ignored the polls or thought their vote didnt matter once inaugurated trump quickly acted on the promises hed made during the campaign many of which were laid out in his first 100 days plan over time all taxes on the rich and corporations were eliminated while spending on the military was increased by a third the national debt exploded trade deals were torn up but instead of creating new manufacturing jobs it caused the loss of 5 million jobs dependent upon exports the cost of imported goods doubled and tripled with new tariffs and trade wars hundreds of walmarts and bargain stores were forced to close abortion was outlawed samesex marriage was criminalized coal mining and offshore drilling were dramatically increased while all support for renewable energy was halted to reduce burdensome regulations the clean air act and the clean water act were gutted and in just a few years americans once again saw smog clouds over its cities acid rain in places like maine and rising pollution in its rivers and shorelines all actions to respond to climate change were stopped nearly all gun laws were eliminated including the ban on militarystyle heavy and tactical weapons millions of children of illegal immigrants were sent back to the country of their parents origin even though they were born here many died trying to return while the nations food industry nearly collapsed from the lack of harvesters food prices skyrocketed immigration was sharply curtailed except for white european christians muslims were excluded altogether in an aging country many companies were forced to close because of a lack of employees nuclear weapons spread to 12 new countries including at least four in danger of being overtaken by extremists who have pledged to use those weapons to eliminate americas major cities reckless taunting and overreactions have engaged the country in five new wars since 2020 as trump promised the world fears america but most of that fear is felt by our former allies who increasingly see the us as an erratic unreliable and dangerous superpower the country is now deeply settled in a second great depression leading to more calls for a dictatorship the children of america have begun to ask some hard questions of their parents at kitchen tables across the country what did you do to stop the rise of trump they ask parents often deny voting for trump others offer sheepish explanations i never thought he would win all the polls had clinton winning i thought i was free to use my vote as a protest against the system but dad didnt you hear what trump was saying didnt you know that there was only one candidate who could have stopped him why didnt you vote for her dad im sorry sweetie i didnt like her very much but why well she used

    "an election is a formal group decisionmaking process whereby a population chooses an individual or multiple individuals to hold public office elections have been the usual mechanism by which modern representative democracy has operated since the 17th century elections may fill offices in the legislature sometimes in the executive and judiciary and for regional and local government such as cities or towns this process is also used in many other standardized associations public businesses and organizations from clubs to voluntary association and corporations the global use of elections as a tool for selecting representatives in modern representative democracies is in contrast with the practice in the democratic archetype ancient athens where the elections were considered an oligarchic institution and most political offices were filled using allotment which is also known as sortition by which office holders were chosen by lot electoral reform describes the process of introducing fair electoral systems where they are not in place or improving the fairness or effectiveness of existing systems psephology is the study of results and other statistics relating to elections especially with a view to predicting future results election is the fact of electing or being elected to elect means to select or to nominate and so sometimes other forms of ballot such as referendums are referred to as elections especially in the united states history elections were used as early in history as ancient greece and ancient rome and throughout the medieval period to select rulers such as the holy roman emperor see imperial election and the pope see papal election the pala king gopala ruled c 750s 770s ce in early medieval bengal was elected by a group of feudal chieftains such elections were quite common in contemporary societies of the region in the chola empire around 920 ce in uthiramerur in presentday tamil nadu palm leaves were used for selecting the village committee members the leaves with candidate names written on them were put inside a mud pot to select the committee members a young boy was asked to take out as many leaves as the number of positions available this was known as the kudavolai system the first recorded popular elections of officials to public office by majority vote where all citizens were eligible both to vote and to hold public office date back to the ephors of sparta in 754 bc under the mixed government of the spartan constitution athenian democratic elections where all citizens could hold public office were not introduced for another 247 years until the reforms of cleisthenes under the earlier solonian constitution c 574 bc all athenian citizens were eligible to vote in the popular assemblies on matters of law and policy and as jurors but only the three highest classes of citizens could vote in elections nor were the lowest of the four classes of athenian citizens as defined by the extent of their wealth and property rather than by birth eligible to hold public office through the reforms of solon the spartan election of the ephors therefore also predates the reforms of solon in athens by approximately 180 years questions of suffrage especially suffrage for minority groups have dominated the history of elections males the dominant cultural group in north america and europe often dominated the electorate and continue to do so in many countries early elections in countries such as the united kingdom and the united states were dominated by landed or ruling class males by 1920 all western european and north american democracies had universal adult male suffrage except switzerland and many countries began to consider womens suffrage despite legally mandated universal suffrage for adult males political barriers were sometimes erected to prevent fair access to elections see civil rights movement contexts elections are held in a variety of political organizational and corporate settings many countries hold elections to select people to serve in their governments but other types of organizations hold elections as well for example many corporations hold elections among shareholders to select a board of directors and these elections may be mandated by corporate law in many places an election to the government is usually a competition among people who have already won a primary election within a political party elections within corporations and other organizations often use procedures and rules that are similar to those of governmental elections electorate suffrage the question of who may vote is a central issue in elections the electorate does not generally include the entire population for example many countries prohibit those who are under the age of majority from voting all jurisdictions require a minimum age for voting in australia aboriginal people were not given the right to vote until 1962 see 1967 referendum entry and in 2010 the federal government removed the rights of prisoners serving for three years or more to vote a large proportion of whom were aboriginal australians suffrage is typically only for citizens of the country though further limits may be imposed in the european union one can vote in municipal elections if one lives in the municipality and is an eu citizen the nationality of the country of residence is not required in some countries voting is required by law eligible voters may be subject to punitive measures such as a fine for not casting a vote in western australia the penalty for a first time offender failing to vote is a 2000 fine which increases to 5000 if the offender refused to vote prior voting population historically the size of eligible voters the electorate was small having the size of groups or communities of privileged men like aristocrats and men of a city citizens with the growth of the number of people with bourgeois citizen rights outside of cities expanding the term citizen the electorates grew to numbers beyond the thousands elections with an electorate in the hundred thousands appeared in the final decades of the roman republic by extending voting rights to citizens outside of rome with the lex julia of 90 bc reaching an electorate of 910000 and estimated voter turnout of maximum 10 in 70 bc only again comparable in size to the first elections of the united states at the same time the kingdom of great britain had in 1780 about 214000 eligible voters 3 of the whole population naturalization can reshape the electorate of a country candidates a representative democracy requires a procedure to govern nomination for political office in many cases nomination for office is mediated through preselection processes in organized political parties nonpartisan systems tend to be different from partisan systems as concerns nominations in a direct democracy one type of nonpartisan democracy any eligible person can be nominated although elections were used in ancient athens in rome and in the selection of popes and holy roman emperors the origins of elections in the contemporary world lie in the gradual emergence of representative government in europe and north america beginning in the 17th century in some systems no nominations take place at all with voters free to choose any person at the time of votingwith some possible exceptions such as through a minimum age requirementin the jurisdiction in such cases it is not required or even possible that the members of the electorate be familiar with all of the eligible persons though such systems may involve indirect elections at larger geographic levels to ensure that some firsthand familiarity among potential electees can exist at these levels ie among the elected delegates systems electoral systems are the detailed constitutional arrangements and voting systems that convert the vote into a political decision the first step is for voters to cast the ballots which may be simple singlechoice ballots but other types such as multiple choice or ranked ballots may also be used then the votes are tallied for which various vote counting systems may be used and the voting system then determines the result on the basis of the tally most systems can be categorized as either proportional majoritarian or mixed among the proportional systems the most commonly used are partylist proportional representation list pr systems among majoritarian are firstpastthepost electoral system single winner plurality voting and different methods of majority voting such as the widely used tworound system mixed systems combine elements of both proportional and majoritarian methods with some typically producing results closer to the former mixedmember proportional or the other eg parallel voting many countries have growing electoral reform movements which advocate systems such as approval voting single transferable vote instant runoff voting or a condorcet method these methods are also gaining popularity for lesser elections in some countries where more important elections still use more traditional counting methods while openness and accountability are usually considered cornerstones of a democratic system the act of casting a vote and the content of a voters ballot are usually an important exception the secret ballot is a relatively modern development but it is now considered crucial in most free and fair elections as it limits the effectiveness of intimidation campaigns when elections are called politicians and their supporters attempt to influence policy by competing directly for the votes of constituents in what are called campaigns supporters for a campaign can be either formally organized or loosely affiliated and frequently utilize campaign advertising it is common for political scientists to attempt to predict elections via political forecasting methods the most expensive election campaign included us7 billion spent on the 2012 united states presidential election and is followed by the us5 billion spent on the 2014 indian general election timing the nature of democracy is that elected officials are accountable to the people and they must return to the voters at prescribed intervals to seek their mandate to continue in office for that reason most democratic constitutions provide that elections are held at fixed regular intervals in the united states elections for public offices are typically held between every two and six years in most states and at the federal level with exceptions for elected judicial positions that may have longer terms of office there is a variety of schedules for example presidents the president of ireland is elected every seven years the president of russia and the president of finland every six years the president of france every five years president of the united states every four years predetermined or fixed election dates have the advantage of fairness and predictability they tend to greatly lengthen campaigns and make dissolving the legislature parliamentary system more problematic if the date should happen to fall at a time when dissolution is inconvenient eg when war breaks out other states eg the united kingdom only set maximum time in office and the executive decides exactly when within that limit it will actually go to the polls in practice this means the government remains in power for close to its full term and chooses an election date it calculates to be in its best interests unless something special happens such as a motion of noconfidence this calculation depends on a number of variables such as its performance in opinion polls and the size of its majority postponing elections beyond the full term has been associated with democratic backsliding snap elections are early elections before the full term of office rolling elections are elections in which all representatives in a body are elected but these elections are spread over a period of time rather than all at once examples are the presidential primaries in the united states elections to the european parliament where due to differing election laws in each member state elections are held on different days of the same week and due to logistics general elections in lebanon and india the voting procedure in the legislative assemblies of the roman republic are also a classical example in rolling elections voters have information about previous voters choices while in the first elections there may be plenty of hopeful candidates in the last rounds consensus on one winner is generally achieved in todays context of rapid communication candidates can put disproportionate resources into competing strongly in the first few stages because those stages affect the reaction of latter stages undemocratic or unfair in many of the countries with weak rule of law the most common reason why elections do not meet international standards of being free and fair is interference from the incumbent government dictators may use the powers of the executive police martial law censorship physical implementation of the election mechanism etc to remain in power despite popular opinion in favour of removal members of a particular faction in a legislature may use the power of the majority or supermajority passing criminal laws and defining the electoral mechanisms including eligibility and district boundaries to prevent the balance of power in the body from shifting to a rival faction due to an election nongovernmental entities can also interfere with elections through physical force verbal intimidation or fraud which can result in improper casting or counting of votes monitoring for and minimizing electoral fraud is also an ongoing task in countries with strong traditions of free and fair elections problems that prevent an election from being free and fair take various forms lack of open political debate or an informed electorate the electorate may be poorly informed about issues or candidates due to lack of freedom of the press lack of objectivity in the press due to state or corporate control or lack of access to news and political media freedom of speech may be curtailed by the state favouring certain viewpoints or state propaganda scheduling frequent elections can also lead to voter fatigue violation of political egalitarianism gerrymandering wasted votes and manipulating electoral thresholds can prevent that all votes count equally interference with campaigns exclusion of opposition candidates from eligibility for office needlessly high nomination rules on who may be a candidate are some of the ways the structure of an election can be changed to favour a specific faction or candidate those in power may arrest or assassinate candidates suppress or even criminalize campaigning close campaign headquarters harass or beat campaign workers or intimidate voters with violence foreign electoral intervention can also occur with the united states interfering between 1946 and 2000 in 81 elections and russia or the soviet union in 36 in 2018 the most intense interventions utilizing false information were by china in taiwan and by russia in latvia the next highest levels were in bahrain qatar and hungary tampering with mechanisms this can include falsifying voter instructions violation of the secret ballot ballot stuffing tampering with voting machines destruction of legitimately cast ballots voter suppression voter registration fraud failure to validate voter residency fraudulent tabulation of results and use of physical force or verbal intimation at polling places other examples include persuading candidates not to run such as through blackmailing bribery intimidation or physical violence shams a sham election or show election is an election that is held purely for show that is without any significant political choice or real impact on the results of the election sham elections are a common event in dictatorial regimes that feel the need to feign the appearance of public legitimacy published results usually show high voter turnout and high support typically at least 80 and close to 100 in many cases for the prescribed candidates or for the referendum choice that favours the political party in power dictatorial regimes can also organize sham elections with results simulating those that might be achieved in democratic countries sometimes only one governmentapproved candidate is allowed to run in sham elections with no opposition candidates allowed or opposition candidates are arrested on false charges or even without any charges before the election to prevent them from running ballots may contain only one yes option or in the case of a simple yes or no question security forces often persecute people who pick no thus encouraging them to pick the yes option in other cases those who vote receive stamps in their passport for doing so while those who did not vote and thus do not receive stamps are persecuted as enemies of the people sham elections can sometimes backfire against the party in power especially if the regime believes they are popular enough to win without coercion fraud or suppressing the opposition the most famous example of this was the 1990 myanmar general election in which the governmentsponsored national unity party suffered a landslide defeat by the opposition national league for democracy and consequently the results were annulled aristocratic some scholars argue that the predominance of elections in modern liberal democracies masks the fact that they are actually aristocratic selection mechanisms that deny each citizen an equal chance of holding public office such views were expressed as early as the time of ancient greece by aristotle according to french political scientist bernard manin the inegalitarian nature of elections stems from four factors the unequal treatment of candidates by voters the distinction of candidates required by choice the cognitive advantage conferred by salience and the costs of disseminating information these four factors result in the evaluation of candidates based on voters partial standards of quality and social saliency for example skin colour and good looks this leads to selfselection biases in candidate pools due to unobjective standards of treatment by voters and the costs barriers to entry associated with raising ones political profile ultimately the result is the election of candidates who are superior whether in actuality or as perceived within a cultural context and objectively unlike the voters they are supposed to represent evidence suggests that the concept of electing representatives was originally conceived to be different from democracy prior to the 18th century some societies in western europe used sortition as a means to select rulers a method which allowed regular citizens to exercise power in keeping with understandings of democracy at the time the idea of what constituted a legitimate government shifted in the 18th century to include consent especially with the rise of the enlightenment from this point onward sortition fell out of favor as a mechanism for selecting rulers on the other hand elections began to be seen as a way for the masses to express popular consent repeatedly resulting in the triumph of the electoral process until the present day this conceptual misunderstanding of elections as open and egalitarian when they are not innately so may thus be a root cause of the problems in contemporary governance those in favor of this view argue that the modern system of elections was never meant to give ordinary citizens the chance to exercise power merely privileging their right to consent to those who rule th",
