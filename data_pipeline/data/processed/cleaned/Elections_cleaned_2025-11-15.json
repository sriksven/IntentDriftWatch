therefore materiality calculations as a percentage of market cap and shares outstanding cannot be performed the significance assessment is based on the absolute size of the ownership stake impact evaluation ownership concentration an ownership stake of 371 is highly significant and represents a controlling interest in the company this gives berkshire hathaway substantial influence over corporate matters including the election of directors and major strategic decisions dilution impact this filing is a statement of ownership and does not involve the issuance of new shares therefore there is no dilutive impact on existing shareholders transaction significance the significance is rated high due to the filers reputation warren buffetts berkshire hathaway and the sheer magnitude of the stake any action taken by an entity with 371 ownership is inherently material to the company and its stock market impact analysis stock impact prediction direction neutral reasoning this is an amendment to a previously disclosed position not a new purchase or sale the market is already aware of berkshires large stake this filing serves to confirm that the position remains largely intact

    "trump says he will sue bbc for at least 1bn over panorama edit bbc news us president donald trump has said he will take legal action against the bbc next week over how his speech was edited by panorama after the corporation apologised but refused to compensate him speaking to reporters on board air force one on friday evening trump said well sue them for anywhere between 1bn and 5bn probably sometime next week the bbc has said the edit of the 6 january 2021 speech had unintentionally given the mistaken impression that president trump had made a direct call for violent action the bbc apologised but said it would not pay financial compensation the controversy led to the resignations of bbc director general tim davie and head of news deborah turness i think i have to do it trump told reporters of his plan to take legal action they cheated they changed the words coming out of my mouth he said he had not raised the issue with prime minister sir keir starmer but that he would call him over the weekend earlier this week the us presidents lawyers threatened to sue the bbc for 1bn in damages unless the corporation issued a retraction apologised and compensated him searches of public court record databases earlier showed no legal action had been filed so far federal and state courts in florida where a case would likely be filed are now closed for the weekend in an interview aired on gb news on saturday and recorded before trump confirmed he would take legal action the us president said ive been doing this for a long time ive never seen anything like that thats thats the most egregious i think that was worse than the kamala thing with cbs and 60 minutes in july this year us media company paramount global agreed to pay 16m 135m to settle a legal dispute with trump regarding an interview it broadcast on cbs with former vicepresident kamala harris i think i have an obligation to do it he said if you dont do it you dont stop it from happening again with other people the bbcs apology came hours after a second similarly edited clip broadcast on newsnight in 2022 was revealed by the daily telegraph in its corrections and clarifications section published on thursday evening the bbc said the panorama programme had been reviewed after criticism of how trumps speech had been edited we accept that our edit unintentionally created the impression that we were showing a single continuous section of the speech rather than excerpts from different points in the speech and that this gave the mistaken impression that president trump had made a direct call for violent action the statement said lawyers for the bbc have written to president trumps legal team in response to a letter received on sunday a bbc spokesperson said on thursday bbc chair samir shah has separately sent a personal letter to the white house making clear to president trump that he and the corporation are sorry for the edit of the presidents speech on 6 january 2021 which featured in the programme they said they added while the bbc sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim in its letter to trumps legal team the bbc set out five main arguments for why it did not think it had a case to answer first it said the bbc did not have the rights to and did not distribute the panorama episode on its us channels when the documentary was available on bbc iplayer it was restricted to viewers in the uk secondly it said the documentary did not cause trump harm as he was reelected shortly after thirdly it said the clip was not designed to mislead but just to shorten a long speech and that the edit was not done with malice fourthly it said the clip was never meant to be considered in isolation rather it was 12 seconds within an hourlong programme which also contained lots of voices in support of trump finally an opinion on a matter of public concern and political speech is heavily protected under defamation laws in the us",

    "never remember democrats are the party of slavery and communist fascist rradditlies descends into chaos over magas goals of creating a white christian enthnostate in the us source context rradditlies is a new sub created for right wingers to complain about being censored on reddit highlights never remember democrats are the party of slavery and communist fascist someone isnt a student of history i see go on yes the party that supported slavery was a far right party called the democrats but the parties swapped ideologies the democrats of the past are the republicans of today the right wing ideology doesnt change ideas the parties do top paragraphsthe democratic and republican parties have not always had the same ideals that they have today in fact americas two dominant political parties have essentially flipped ideologies in the time since they were founded the democratic party was founded in 1828 while the republican party dates back to 1854 in its early years the republican party was considered quite liberal while the democrats were known for staunch conservatism this is the exact opposite of how each party would be described today prime example of why republicans want to cut education but send their kids to ivy league schools doe has been failing for 30 years how long do pump money into a sinking ship before you say fuck it and build a new one us education hit its highest point 20 years after the creation of the doe and even if that wasnt true thats like saying hey there was an ecoli outbreak lets defund the fda since they didnt stop it thats nice and shiny but no democrats just switched from abusing slaves to abusing government and government services while holding minorities down while blaming the republicans like most of history you cant believe everything you read democrats are the same type of people we just live in different times holy mental gymnastics democrats saying their republicans is olympic level gymnastics first off its theyre buddy come on this is like 3rd grade english stuff second the party swap happened pretending it didnt is historical revisionism dressed up as a hot take the only revisionist here is you attempting to say the parties flipped historical facts bear that out they indeed did not flip except that did in every matter ideologically you can literally see democrat politicians switching to the republican party over time if you look at any of the prominent politicians of the time lmao democrats realizing that direct racism isnt going to win elections anymore doesnt magically flip the parties the party flip or southern strategy was a political pr campaign to fix democrats image the dude who came up with it wrote the book on it so youre fine with democrats tearing down confederate war memorials then i dont approve of the technique used nor do i care for anything confederate great then next time someone proposes tearing them down stay shut then you wont mind people tearing down all those george floyd statues for supporting a violent criminal a violent criminal who overdosed when he died and also pointed a gun at a pregnant womans stomach during a home invasion oh shit you have new information this is well known information just not to the propagandizedpsyopd i mean even the police brutality narrative false apart once you bring reality into that conversation but to leftists facts and stats are racism bigotry and oppression lol no actual facts support your feelings on this i know that maga cultists dont like those pesky facts though elaborate george floyd never committed a crime right before his arrest george floyd didnt have a lethal combo of meth and fetty in his system when he died george floyd didnt point a gun at a pregnant womans belly during a home invasion or that he wasnt a total scumbag more generally idk what exactly you are disputing try harder or dont bother commenting or is that me oppressing you by even asking you to actually try idk the rules of the everchanging farleft cultic orthodoxy what some lefties dont understand is that farleft people want to exterminate people too killallmen is far left kill all men is shitposting mate maybe so but there have been other examples my now ex friend celebrated charlie kirk getting shot youll live unlike kirk kirks death was probably just brought on by fentanyl or something we shouldnt be caring about a criminal thug yeah until we see the toxicology report we really dont know funny how the republicans love hitler and ethnic cleansing last i checked democrats support planned parenthood i sure do your point good to meet a fellow fascist who also wants to participate in eugenics thats not eugenics genius you dont know what it means or the definition of the word obviously stop using neat big words you heard on the interwebs without educating yourself on what they mean no excuse google is available to all of us somebody going to planned parenthood of their own volition to get plan b or whatever isnt eugenics getting an abortion of your own will isnt eugenics it isnt fascism to provide medical care that they do in about 90 of westernized countries we cant let those disgusting poor people reproduce only viable offspring of collegeeducated elites we can trust to rear their offspring properly i like the tendency to use air quotes around things no one has said i want to enslave all nonwhites evasionplan some republicans have stated this is a white only country and this is a christian country there is also a strong antiimmigrant component to the republican party there is also the nazi component who wouldnt have a problem genociding nonwhites source alligator lives matter the good news is alligators are guaranteed at least 65 million meals if we get started now this is a troll post by a fringe right person the post also doesnt have anything to do with race christians or immigrants shes been flying on air force one what does that have to do with anything when youre traveling with the president you aint exactly fringe no more says who be for real 12 more comments of these two arguing i dont need the left wing to take care of my needs i also dont need them forcing me to take care of someone elses needs you do realize that the gop just wants you to take care of billionaire needs right you do realize posts on reddit are uniformly wildly wrong heres why he isnt modern life is built on interdependence you dont grow your own food mine your own metal generate all your own power or build your own roads you rely on other peoples labor infrastructure and institutions thats what makes advanced societies possible was this a response to the right comment wdym you said that comments like his were wrong i provided evidence to the contrary to the best of my ability then you did an awful job because it was a word salad you also misunderstood my point seemingly and what was your point if you were not calling the other guy wrong what i was saying that almost any if not literally any post on reddit which is an echochamber of online losers that begins as it does is retarded that is it liberals are like fight fascism rights are like good thing we have our guns then right lefties are like we need to take away guns the lefties have never been about taking guns away smoothbrain take oh yea i forgot its the right that takes away guns imagine lol reagan enacted more gun control than any single president ever true totally relevant because the living rightoids are all advocating for stricter gun laws you mean like the current doj fighting to take away gun rights from marijuana users is that living enough for you now thats a good argument but its still better than the alternative i personally agree with regulating guns of people who habitually smoke should do the same but stricter with those for alcohol so you support more gun control than the left does because gun bans drug addicts having guns lmfao i do support people regulations thats for sure 10 more comments of these two arguing righties are like 3 hitler uwu in texts and lefties are like hey that seems kinda bad and then the righties are like nuh uhh ur the bad bad not saying that i support the real nazis that my great grandfather fought but there is a thing called dark humor ah yes the dark humor that involves elected officials saying they want to see people burn and praising hitler what silly little jokesters its no different than the leftists making memes of charlie kirk getting shot right people on reddit quoting kirks shitty opinions is equal to rightwing politicians literally praising hitler weird stretch there lad i guess youve been blind to your own sides actions i see what we do you refuse to see what you do nah when there is a democrat organization who leaks texts about wanting to round up everyone on the right into camps and install a communist government let me know happened during covid quite a bit no it didnt thats a dumb thing to say righties are like 3 hitler uwu in texts private texts and lefties are like hey that seems kinda bad lefties are actually like you must be literally nazi fascists because of that and then the righties are like nuh uhh ur the bad bad righties are actually like uh no it was a joke you rtard there fixed it for you comrade its pretty funny that you dont realize how bad this makes you look our politicians just joke about loving hitler leftie reminds me of when my friend got an anime body pillow as a joke lmao like i dont think he was fucking the pillow but it was equally weird to have it in his bed either way exactly like these people think it makes their elected politicians look better by saying they were just joking about mass killing their political rivals and praising a genocidal dictator about mass killing their political rivals and praising a genocidal dictator the crazy part is that youre not joking you believe this shit unironically you are deranged yes i believe the thing that objectively provably did happen i know that must be crazy to a maga youre insufferable to be clear im saying that you believe that youre opponents are hitler lovers unironically and that that is crazy and deranged i am not saying that its deranged to believe hitler was real and did the holocaust ofcourse he did ofcourse it one of the worst things to happen in humanity ofcourse no serious person believes it didnt happen or was good you wanting to believe your political opponents believe such a heinous thing does not make it true as much as you would like that to be the case for an easy win but ive wasted too much breath already you are deranged you will never be convinced your political opponents are just normal people you need to believe theyre evil so you can accept that your side lost an election or two please try to punch a nazi at a 2nd amendment rally id hate to be around your circle of people if you think its normal to praise hitler and make racist slurs about black people kinda just validating what we all think about you to be honest also now you are using dogwhistles to say you hope i get shot why are maga such absolute pieces of shit are you saying punch a nazi is not a slogan you agree with and not an acceptable way to engage in politics im a literal jewish man and i joke about hitler all the time its not that fucking deep if you cant laugh in this world you have nothing stop criminalizing words edit im no longer replying to bad faith gotchas if you think im a nazi for laughing at things so be it second edit this randomly got astroturfed ive now had a dozen replies in literally 2 minutes when this thread was mostly quiet for over an hour in your political organizations groupchat you tell hitler jokes all the time what a brave pioneer you are patriot false

    "epstein and trump may have remained social im not able to post a series of screenshots to rpolitics or the other subs i tried first but im happy to share here looking through the files i came across some emails which challenge claims by trump and his supporters that he cut epstein off because he was a creep the first email is from christmas of 2016 right after the election in which epstein says he is with all the trump boys a claim which did not get a surprised response from his friend boris nickolic described by fox business as a biotech venture capitalist second is an email chain with nicholas ribis a mutual friend of epsteins and trumps who served as ceo of trump hotels casino resorts until 2000 in which epstein says he has heard that trump was claiming to have ended their friendship 15 years earlier for reasons unrelated to him being a creep which ribis says was to discredit or downgrade u to the person he said it to now if trump was uninvolved in epsteins sex crimes and broke off their friendship over epstein poaching girls it would make a lot more sense that he might discredit epstein based on him being a convicted sex offender who poached girls yet instead trump felt a need to make up a story about epstein not helping him in a lawsuit this throws into question trumps potential motive for distancing from epstein if he did at all and the third image is the thanksgiving 2017 email which has actually made the rounds i had it in my screenshots so im sharing it here in addition to the christmas 2016 one these dont prove what sort of relationship trump and epstein may have had at this point by this point epstein had been badmouthing trump to whoever would listen they were in the same social circles however so at the very least they may have maintained a cordial relationship",

custom was buried because the phial rings drove their wearers mad this was an intended effect as they were actually soulstealing rings that ragisis was sacrificing young witches to so he could bolster his own power upon discovering this the four witches killed ragisis before the madness of the rings got to them and they created the dungeon that custom is trapped in today rance resolves to free the witches from the control of the corrupted rings and does so one witch at a time 2 of them make prominent reappearances in later games maria custard is the first witch rance rescues despite being a mage she is much more skilled at engineering building a series of mechanical weapons called tulips that are unlike anything the continent has ever seen shizuka masou is the last witch rance rescues and the strongest of them all her single minded drive to get revenge on the man who killed her father kicks off an important subplot later down the line maria left and shizuka right in the dungeon is also where rance encounters feliss a devil devils serve the devil god rathowm and are tasked with collecting human souls to empower him feliss tries to sign off rances soul in exchange for 3 wishes but with his 3rd wish he breaks off the contract leaving feliss thoroughly humiliated after saving all the witches and retrieving the rings ragisis steals back the phial rings and together with the four witches of custom rance manages to defeat the tyrannical wizard once and for all rance stands strong against a transformed ragisis rance 03 the fall of leazas the helman empire leazas enemy to the north and the largest human nation on the continent has a succession crisis the country is divided between patton helman firstborn bastard son of the emperor and sheila the emperors secondborn legitimate daughter patton trying to rally support allies with the dark lords noce ithere and satella to invade leazas the dark lords are servants to the demon king but the person meant to serve as the demon king went into hiding and suppressed their powers allowing the dark lords to do as they please currently they are at war amongst themselves over whether to make dark lord kayblis the demon king by killing the current one or to let the current one fully come into their role these objectives divide the kayblis faction and hornet faction respectively the dark lords contacted by patton all serve the hornet faction with help from the obscenely powerful dark lords patton invades easily but lias personal ninja kanami kentou manages to flee the palace to get word to rance who lia hopes will rescue the kingdom from this dilemma after being promised due compensation rance treks through the continent crossing and meeting many old allies and new enemies in the city of custom he joins the four witches and former leazish troops in the leazas liberation army he also meets with feliss again whos doing significantly worse after the stunt he pulled back in 02 after learning the devils true name rance binds her to his servitude and her reluctant aid becomes key at multiple points throughout the journey the power of a devil is no joke it turns out dark lord noce had his own reasons for helping patton noce swore undying loyalty to demon king gele who was sealed by the previous demon king underneath what is currently the capital of leazas as the leazas liberation force approaches the capital noce almost kills patton before moving to undo the seal on demon king gele patton is thankfully saved by his mentor hunty kalar who teleports them far away from the conflict geles seal is maintained by the demon sword chaos one of the only weapons in the world that can harm dark lords and the demon king thanks to their otherwise impenetrable invincibility fields that shield them from all damage rance takes chaos who can talk btw before using it to slaughter the dark lords and with help from all his allies gele herself however before dying gele teleports him and sill to an obscene location the wargod city of ylapu floating 2500 meters in the sky rance iv the legacy of the sect during the reign of the previous demon king gi successor to gele an interesting historical development took place esteemed magic researcher luca rune discovered a way to transmute living flesh into magically enhanced metal called biometal he used this invention to create cyborg tousho soldiers robotic toushin warriors and even giant floating islands known as toushin toshi all to do war against the demon king luca rune leading his five aces however due to the dark lords invincibility fields this conflict known as the dark lord war proved ineffective in the end a powermad rune was killed by his mentorturnedtousho freak paraffin and his immortal ally hunty kalar this all took place around 600 years ago regardless now rance and sill are on one such toushin toshi and so are an expeditionary force sent by helman to try and secure anything thatd help in the war against leazas which has since ended but they are still unaware at the same time the forces of leazas discover rances location and on lias orders form the rance rescue corps to bring him back rance the helman expedition and the rescue corps all race to secure the 4 keys required to unlock one of the last living toushin war machines toushin upsilon the leader of the helman expedition is adamant on retrieving it for his country so he can get a promotion inevitably toushin upsilon is released and only the combined efforts of rance and everyone on the island of ylapu can put it down for good following the destruction of its cargo the floating landmass begins crashing down to earth requiring a speedy getaway by rance and co amongst it all helman expeditionary hubert lipton meets freak paraffin who had been studying and maintaining the toushin toshi for centuries hubert is a close friend of pattons and quickly befriends freak as well when the island begins crashing who is there to rescue them but hunty kalar who teleports them to safety in order to meet with patton as they begin planning for a return to helman rance 5d the lonely girl on one random day following the events of rance 4 rance and sill are lost in a seemingly unnavigable dungeon there they meet copandon dott a dedicated capitalist who believes luck and money rule the world eventually the duo escape and happen upon genbu castle which in actuality is a spacetime bubble created by a dark lord long ago to forever trap and maintain the youth of their unwilling lover the castle holds up to one person at a time in suspended animation and to leave one must trap another in their place rizna lanfbitt is a former mage from zeth who has been trapped in genbu castle eternally young for the past 30 years everyone who has happened upon her manipulated and abused her trust to escape while leaving her behind at first she thinks rance is no different and attempts to manipulate him instead but once she starts being honest with rance and tells him the whole story the adventurer concocts a cunning plan to seal one of his bothersome enemies in the castle and escape with rizna copandon and sill in tow its also in this game where the devil feliss becomes pregnant with rances first child though the adventurer makes liberal use of contraceptive magic in this game rance ends up boning feliss while shes on her flux the devil equivalent of a period this is extremely dangerous and feliss almost ends up dying because rance doesnt know how dangerous a flux can be rance vi the collapse of zeth the magic kingdom of zeth follows a strict hierarchy between mages and nonmages nonmages in zeth are second class citizens and their lives are essentially forfeit allowing the noble class of mages to enslave or kill them as they please zeth also shares a border with the monster realm and can only fend off the monster army that serves under the demon king and dark lords thanks to the maginot line a wall armed with insanely lethal magic defenses maintaining such a powerful defense takes up 40 of the national budget but without it monsterkind would most likely exterminate humanity when rance and sill venture into zeth they end up joining a resistance movement called ice flame dedicated to equal rights for nonmages ice flame is led by urza pranaice who recently lost her way after being traumatized by the death of her family in a failed mission on some of their missions they run into pentagon an extremist nonmage rights group that seeks to reverse the social order and put nonmages on top both groups end up being puppeted by a dark lord named sieg into attacking the 4 mana batteries that power the maginot line the rationale is that depowering the maginot line will cause a national crisis allowing a nonmage military takeover while urza objects she is not strong enough to stop the plan from unfolding rance also occasionally encounters his and felisss son dark rance it turns out that in devil society having a child with a human is the highest possible offense and feliss now lives on the run barely able to survive or protect her child dark rance swears revenge on his father for ruining his mothers life and attempts to kill him for several games but to no avail when the maginot line shuts down monsters predictably begin to invade all of zeth both mage and nonmage is forced to unite to brave the crisis they migrate and regroup at adams fortress near the border with leazas rances involvement thankfully means lia wont take advantage of this weakened zeth for being a skilled combatant able to wield chaos one of humanitys only hopes against dark lords and the demon king rance earns the respect of the king of zeth ragnarokarc super gandhi ragnarokarc offers to let rance marry his daughter magic the gandhi to which rance accepts magic might need more convincing though urza having attained selfactualization after realizing the wishes of the people before her steps into her role as a proper leader together she and ragnarokarc mobilize an elite squad to use the last surviving mana battery and a spare underneath the maginot line to reactivate the line and clear out the monsters rance obviously joins such a squad and together with his allies kills dark lord sieg defeats several apostles servants of dark lords and seals the elite dark lord camilla without their foremost commanders and with the maginot line reactivated the monster army falls into chaos and is easily expelled from zeth in the chaos rance and sill depart for nippon without a word leaving a frustrated magic waiting at the altar zeth is reformed without them and through urzas efforts mages and nonmages eventually begin living in harmony during the zethan conflict rance gets to know and fight alongside a reformed patton misnarge who snuck into zeth to train incognito in the time since rance 03 patton has grown into a mighty inspiring and understanding leader by witnessing the zeth catastrophe and rances strength firsthand he develops several new ideas for how to bring reform to his homeland of helman there is also a notable addition to shizukas story nagi su ragarl a powerful mage and political figure in zeth turns out to be shizukas half sister conceived when chenezale do ragarl killed shizukas father and raped her mother nagi was raised her whole life to kill shizuka but upon realizing the resemblance to her mother an old and decrepit chenezale began obsessing over shizuka instead eager to recapture her fathers affection nagi makes a show of dueling and killing shizuka right in front of him a fate the witch manages to avoid with the help of her friends and rance failing this nagi goes completely insane accidentally kills her father and storms off in a cloud of hatred shizuka though technically fulfilling her revenge feels empty and vows to find nagi and help her recover as the same man ruined both their lives rance vii sengoku rance rance and sill arrive on the island nation of nippon for some rest and relaxation right in the middle of its 4th sengoku war warlords from across the country are all vying for dominance in an obvious homage to the sengoku jidai of real japanese history caught in the middle of this power struggle rance allies himself with a sickly oda nobunaga and begins commanding the forces of oda from the shadows rance also gets acquainted with nobunagas kid sister kouhime who nobunaga cares for more than anyone while conquering across nippon he meets many grand and important figures among them are the catlike kunoichi suzume the honorable isoroku yamamoto the battlehungry senhime the combatmaid mouri teru the frigid tourin sanada and nippons strongest swordswoman uesugi kenshin meanwhile xavier an ancient dark lord sealed in nippon millennium ago and carefully guarded by the nations religion the tenshi sect begins his revival though his soul was sealed in 8 tenshiist gourds scattered throughout the nation by breaking one and then possessing oda nobunaga xavier is able to steal gourds from the nations rance pillages before rejoining with their contents xavier gets pretty far this way until hes discovered by rance and kouhime though nobunaga uses the last of his strength to let rance and co score a decisive killing blow xavier manages to escape by the skin of his teeth its at this point that rance allies himself with miki kurusu and kentarou ogawa the runaway demon king and her boyfriend respectively she and kentarou have been searching all over the continent for a way to safely return mikis humanity to quell the bloodlust that comes with being demon king she needs to regularly eat hirami lemons when kentarou faces one of xaviers apostles he ends up dying and miki turns him into a dark lord to save him ashamed at what shes done miki runs away but doesnt bring any hirami lemons bringing her dangerously close to reawakening as the demon king when rance kentarou and sill find her in this state miki lashes out and uses one of the demon kings spells the eternal ice before being force fed a hirami lemon by kentarou the spell ends up hitting sill freezing her in an unmelting chunk of ice rance pushes through the heartbreak of losing sill to face xavier one final time taking all of nippon back from the dark lords clutches he then resolves to leave sill with kouhime as he wanders the continent in search of a cure kentarou and miki return to their own journey of seeking a cure for miki rance viii rance quest magnum searching for a way to break sills curse rance attempts to contact the kalars of kalar forest however while searching for a way in he unwittingly bones the kalar queen pastel during her artificial impregnation ritual which earns him the ire of the entire kalar race pastel is furious over this transgression and curses rance with the abstinence morurun which prevents him from having sex with any girl under level 35 rance proceeds to spend most of the game searching for highlevel women and trying to break his own curse pastel has rances daughter named reset and sends her to kill rance however reset gets along with her father swimmingly and the whole plan fails opting for revenge over reason pastel then takes the 3 ancient kalar treasures to kill rance all of which are promptly confiscated by crook mofus crook is one of 4 candidates for the al churchs papacy which becomes relevant later the loss of the 3 kalar treasures weakens the barrier protecting the kalar forest allowing helman to invade rance swoops in to save the day ingratiating himself to the kalars and rendering any further offense pastel had against him useless before pastel tries to hang herself in shame the previous kalar queens possess her body and challenge rance one after another in a gauntlet only after he defeats them all and returns pastels body is she finally able to accept him with pastel on his side rance calls in a favor from the kalar queen seeking to use her expertise on curses to lift the one cast on sill pastel tries her best but in the end sill is incurable and rance nearly loses all hope to get him back on his feet lia parapara leazas lets rance know of a curseremoving artifact hidden in helmans royal coffers she has no confirmation of its existence but even if it turns out to not exist rance destabilizing her political rivals in helman is an opportunity she certainly wont turn down also in the time since rance 5d copandon dott has succeeded in her venture capitalist journey and has ascended to one of the richest people on the continent with this immense wealth she has become the defacto leader of the free cities alliance and as thanks to rance for saving her all those years ago funds the construction of rance castle to provide the adventurer with a lavish permanent residence in the expanded magnum storyline rance helps crook overcome her selfdoubt and she fully applies herself to winning the mula race becoming pope of alism the continents dominant religion at around the same time an organization called the shepherds incite mayhem and suffering all across the continent corrupting peoples souls and attempting to plunge them into complete despair one such plot involves sacrificing feliss to the demon sword chaos to empower its blade with the blood of a devil they torture and begin to kill feliss slowly but rance saves her at the last moment before sheltering her in rance castle only once crook becomes pope and communicates with the goddess alice founder of alism does the reason for the shepherds actions become clear the gods of the rance world serve the creator god ludo rathowm with the express purpose of providing him entertainment by making the world as tragic and dramatic as possible the al church is merely a pawn in the game of the gods steering the continent towards chaos and away from peace keeping the continent at war merely to entertain ludo rathowm he relishes in the suffering of humans and loves nothing more than toying with his creations before crushing their hopes and dreams the shepherds led by a former pope of alism named am yisael intend to combat this vicious cycle by corrupting souls and sending them to the devil god rathowm rathowm intends to usurp the creator god ludo rathowm and to do so will need all the souls he can get filling souls with despair is the easiest way to send them to rathowm empowering him so he may one day topple the gods from their selfrighteous thrones while opposed to the gods heartless treatment of their creations crook also disagrees with ams methods for getting revenge so with rances help crook defeats the shepherds and imprisons am yisael for the time being rance ix the helmanian revolution helman is a nation with a long history founded 600 years ago by freak paraffin and hunty kalar it was built on the ruins of mm runes holy magic sect lying dormant beneath its capital are the long forgotten toushin war machines created by the sect with power on par with the dark lords patton misnarge villainous instigator of rance 03 and ally to rance during his adventures in zeth has finally completed his preparation to stage a revolution in helman and reclaim his rightful kingdom having seen the anomalous power of rance firsthand during the events of rance vi patton recruits the adventurer as the commander of the revolutionaries elite strike team the outlaws rance eager to experience the women in helman and to uncover its curseremoving artifact to save sill jumps on the opportunity soon after making it to the wintry land the party is joined by russian kalette a slave they save from a trading caravan as the outlaws begin their assault on helmans key cities pattons powerful allies begin making their moves hunty kalar distracts the brunt of helmans military might by funneling patrols from the monster realm towards helmans borders while raising smaller revolutions far from where the outlaws plan to strike freak paraffin recovers an old invention from the days of the dark lord war the hoverfort this moving fortress ferries the outlaws from city to city allowing them to scale helmans impenetrable walls meanwhile turmoil is brewing among the helmanian top brass stessel romanov current prime minister of helman is revealed to be a descendant of the holy mages that worked with mm rune on the toushin toshi a severe sociopath and narcissist he believes that being pureblooded holy mage entitles him to world domination stessel manipulated and seduced his way into power orchestrating pattons disastrous defeat to leazas installing his daughter sheila as a puppet monarch and getting to work reviving the ultimate toushin meant to be commanded by mm rune to defeat the demon king toushin mm with its power he intends to conquer the entirety of the continent sheila herself resents being kept powerless and completely trapped by stessels need for control she enacts a plan to sneak out of the capital by using magic to swap identities with her maid peruele donning the name russian kalette she intends to escape to leazas however peruele jealous of having always held a lower station sells her to slave traders instead this is how she encounters rance and company and for a majority of the game her true identity remains a secret regardless the outlaws face off against helmans toughest generals and even supernatural threats but continue to emerge victorious eventually they capture the fake princess peruele and sheila is forced to reveal herself along the way shizuka and nagi resolve their dispute for the past 3 games nagi has been chasing shizuka across the continent enhancing her body by any means necessary at the cost of her health in hopes she can kill shizuka and finally be fulfilled in helman nagis body begins crumbling apart due to all the modifications and as a last ditch effort to save her shizuka performs a forbidden spell storing nagis soul in her body before splitting her body mass in two essentially shizuka performs mitosis and gives the new being nagis soul giving the girl a new life and identity approaching the capital freak paraffin gives his life trying to protect the group from stessels tousho bodyguard bastet hunty is devastated by the loss but rekindles her determination to continue blazing towards the future with patton by her side supported by the strength of defecting helmanian generals the outlaws finally arrive at the capital city toppling stessel from power and even stopping the rampage of toushin mm at pattons coronation he crushes the crown between his fists and announces the birth of a new democratic republic in helman sheila is elected helmans first president and every revolutionary takes a hand in shaping the new nations future meanwhile rance books it

    "an election is a formal group decisionmaking process whereby a portion or all of a population or group votes to chooses an individual or multiple individuals to hold public office or other position of responsibility elections have been the usual mechanism by which modern representative democracy has operated since the 17th century elections may fill offices in the legislature sometimes in the executive and judiciary and for regional and local government such as cities or towns this process is also used in many other standardized associations public businesses and organizations from clubs to voluntary association and corporations the global use of elections as a tool for selecting representatives in modern representative democracies is in contrast with the practice in the democratic archetype ancient athens where the elections were considered an oligarchic institution and most political offices were filled using allotment which is also known as sortition by which office holders were chosen by lot electoral reform describes the process of introducing fair electoral systems where they are not in place or improving the fairness or effectiveness of existing systems psephology is the study of results and other statistics relating to elections especially with a view to predicting future results the term elect means to select or to nominate so sometimes other forms of balloting such as referendums are referred to as elections especially in the united states history elections were used as early in history as ancient greece and ancient rome and throughout the medieval period to select rulers such as the holy roman emperor see imperial election and the pope see papal election the pala king gopala ruled c 750s 770s ce in early medieval bengal was elected by a group of feudal chieftains such elections were quite common in contemporary societies of the region in the chola empire around 920 ce in uthiramerur in presentday tamil nadu palm leaves were used for selecting the village committee members the leaves with candidate names written on them were put inside a mud pot to select the committee members a young boy was asked to take out as many leaves as the number of positions available this was known as the kudavolai system the first recorded popular elections of officials to public office by majority vote where all citizens were eligible both to vote and to hold public office date back to the ephors of sparta in 754 bc under the mixed government of the spartan constitution athenian democratic elections where all citizens could hold public office were not introduced for another 247 years until the reforms of cleisthenes under the earlier solonian constitution c 574 bc all athenian citizens were eligible to vote in the popular assemblies on matters of law and policy and as jurors but only the three highest classes of citizens could vote in elections nor were the lowest of the four classes of athenian citizens as defined by the extent of their wealth and property rather than by birth eligible to hold public office through the reforms of solon the spartan election of the ephors therefore also predates the reforms of solon in athens by approximately 180 years questions of suffrage especially suffrage for minority groups have dominated the history of elections males the dominant cultural group in north america and europe often dominated the electorate and continue to do so in many countries early elections in countries such as the united kingdom and the united states were dominated by landed or ruling class males by 1920 all western european and north american democracies had universal adult male suffrage except switzerland and many countries began to consider womens suffrage despite legally mandated universal suffrage for adult males political barriers were sometimes erected to prevent fair access to elections see civil rights movement contexts elections are held in a variety of political organizational and corporate settings many countries hold elections to select people to serve in their governments but other types of organizations hold elections as well for example many corporations hold elections among shareholders to select a board of directors and these elections may be mandated by corporate law in many places an election to the government is usually a competition among people who have already won a primary election within a political party elections within corporations and other organizations often use procedures and rules that are similar to those of governmental elections electorate suffrage the question of who may vote is a central issue in elections the electorate does not generally include the entire population for example many countries prohibit those who are under the age of majority from voting all jurisdictions require a minimum age for voting in australia aboriginal people were not given the right to vote until 1962 see 1967 referendum entry and in 2010 the federal government removed the rights of prisoners serving for three years or more to vote a large proportion of whom were aboriginal australians suffrage is typically only for citizens of the country though further limits may be imposed in the european union one can vote in municipal elections if one lives in the municipality and is an eu citizen the nationality of the country of residence is not required in some countries voting is required by law eligible voters may be subject to punitive measures such as a fine for not casting a vote in western australia the penalty for a first time offender failing to vote is a 2000 fine which increases to 5000 if the offender refused to vote prior voting population historically the size of eligible voters the electorate was small due to the size of groups or communities and to the limited number privileged to vote like aristocrats and men of a city citizens with more people having bourgeois citizen rights outside of cities expanding the term citizen the electorates grew to numbers beyond the thousands elections with an electorate in the hundred thousands appeared in the final decades of the roman republic by extending voting rights to citizens outside of rome with the lex julia of 90 bc reaching an electorate of 910000 and estimated voter turnout of maximum 10 in 70 bc only again comparable in size to the first elections of the united states at the same time the kingdom of great britain had in 1780 about 214000 eligible voters 3 of the whole population naturalization can reshape the electorate of a country candidates a representative democracy requires a procedure to govern nomination for political office in many cases nomination for office is mediated through preselection processes in organized political parties nonpartisan systems tend to be different from partisan systems as concerns nominations in a direct democracy one type of nonpartisan democracy any eligible person can be nominated although elections were used in ancient athens in rome and in the selection of popes and holy roman emperors the origins of elections in the contemporary world lie in the gradual emergence of representative government in europe and north america beginning in the 17th century in some systems no nominations take place at all with voters free to choose any person at the time of votingwith some possible exceptions such as through a minimum age requirementin the jurisdiction in such cases it is not required or even possible that the members of the electorate be familiar with all of the eligible persons though such systems may involve indirect elections at larger geographic levels to ensure that some firsthand familiarity among potential electees can exist at these levels ie among the elected delegates systems in a democracy the members of the government are elected by a portion of the people who vote in an election elections are a way for an electorate to elect that is choose from several different candidates many countries in the world see an elections fought principally between two opposing parties these two will be the most established and most popular parties in the country for example in the us the competition is between the republicans and the democrats o in an indirect democracy voting is the method by which the person elected in charge represents the people whilst making decisions direct democracy is the complete opposite the people make the policy decisions directly without selecting a representative to do it for them a majority vote is when more than half of voters vote for the same person or party however whilst it is usually said each individuals vote does count many countries use a combination of factors to decide who has power not the atlarge popular vote most influential of these factors are districts that divide the electorate for example in the uk a party winning plurality in a majority of constituencies wins majority government but they may not always have the most individual votes ie they may have lose the popular vote but still win the seat count it is also possible for a party to win plurality in a minority of constituencies but more than any other one party and thus win minority government electoral systems are the detailed constitutional arrangements and voting systems that convert the vote into a political decision the first step is for voters to cast the ballots which may be simple singlechoice ballots but other types such as multiple choice or ranked ballots may also be used then the votes are tallied for which various vote counting systems may be used and the voting system then determines the result on the basis of the tally most systems can be categorized as either proportional majoritarian or mixed among the proportional systems the most commonly used are partylist proportional representation list pr systems among majoritarian are firstpastthepost electoral system single winner plurality voting and different methods of majority voting such as the widely used tworound system mixed systems combine elements of both proportional and majoritarian methods with some typically producing results closer to the former mixedmember proportional or the other eg parallel voting many countries have growing electoral reform movements which advocate systems such as approval voting single transferable vote instant runoff voting or a condorcet method these methods are also gaining popularity for lesser elections in some countries where more important elections still use more traditional counting methods while openness and accountability are usually considered cornerstones of a democratic system the act of casting a vote and the content of a voters ballot are usually an important exception the secret ballot is a relatively modern development but it is now considered crucial in most free and fair elections as it limits the effectiveness of intimidation electoral systems there are many electoral methods the purpose of an election may be to choose one person such as a president or a group such as a committee or a parliament in electing a parliament either each of many small constituencies can elect a single representative as in britain or each of a lesser number of multimember constituencies may elect two or more representatives as in ireland or multimember districts and some singlemember districts can be used or the entire country can be treated as one atlarge district as in the netherlands different voting systems require different levels of support to be elected plurality voting firstpastthepost voting elects the candidate with more votes than any other single candidate it does not require the winner to achieve a voting majority to have more than half of the total votes cast in firstpastthepost voting when more than two candidates run the winner commonly has less than half of the vote as few as 18 percent was recorded in 2014 in toronto in instantrunoff voting a candidate must have a majority of votes to be elected although presence of exhausted votes may mean that the majority at time of final count is not majority of votes cast in stv any candidate who takes quota usually set at much less than half of the votes is elected others without quota but with more votes than any other single candidate may be declared elected as well side effects of firstpastthepost voting include a waste of votes due to vote splitting a twoparty system and political polarization due to electing candidates that do not support centrism to understand why a race using firstpastthepost voting tends to favor lesscentric candidates consider a simple lab experiment where students in a class vote for their favorite marble if five marbles are assigned names and are placed up for election and if three of them are green one is red and one is blue then a green marble will rarely win the election the reason for the greens lack of success is vote splitting the three green marbles will split the votes of those who prefer green in fact in this analogy the only way that a green marble is likely to win is if more than threefifths of the voters prefer green if the same number of people prefer green as those who prefer red and blue that is to say if onethird of the voters prefer green onethird prefer blue and onethird prefer red then each green marble will only get oneninth of the vote if the green marbles each take same number of votes while the red and blue marbles will each get onethird putting the green marbles at a serious disadvantage if the experiment is repeated with other colors the color that is in the majority if the majority is split among multiple choices will still rarely win in other words from a purely mathematical perspective a singlewinner system tends to favor a winner that is different from the majority if the majority runs multiple candidates and if the minority group runs just one candidate this minority rule success can also result if multiple winners are elected and voters cast multiple votes plurality block voting but even if the majority is split among multiple candidates proportionate results can still be produced if votes can be transferred as under stv or if multiple winners are elected and each voter has just one vote alternatives to firstpastthepost voting include approval voting tworound proportional representation and instantrunoff voting with approval voting voters are encouraged to vote for as many candidates as they approve of so the winner is much more likely to be any one of the five marbles because people who prefer green will be able to vote for every one of the green marbles with tworound elections the field of candidates is thinned prior to the second round of voting in most cases the winner must receive a majority of the votes which is more than half if no candidate obtains a majority in the first round then the two candidates with the most significant plurality run again for the second round of voting variants exist regarding these two points the requirement for being elected at the first round is sometimes less than 50 and the rules for participation in the runoff may vary instantrunoff voting and stv uses single ranked votes block voting are often used for atlarge positions such as members of a city council in a voting system that uses multiple votes plurality block voting the voter can vote for a multiplemember subset of the running candidates so a voter might vote for alice bob and charlie rejecting daniel and emily approval voting uses such multiple votes in irv if no single candidate has 50 of the vote then the candidate with the fewest votes is excluded and their votes are redistributed according to the voters nominated order of preference the process repeats itself until a candidate has 50 or more votes the system is designed to produce the same result as an exhaustive ballot but using only a single round of voting under stv ranked voting is also used in a pr format prstv is used in australia ireland and malta voters rank candidates to provide backup preferences quota is calculated in say a fourseat constituency quota if droop quota is used is 20 percent of the valid vote plus 1 every candidate with quota of 1st preferences alone or combination of first preferences and later preferences will be elected if a candidate has more than a quota and seats are yet to be filled hisher surplus will be distributed to other candidates in proportion to the candidates next usable preferences marked on the vote if any if there are still candidates to be elected and no surplus votes to be transferred the leastpopular candidate is eliminated as above in av or irv and the process continues until four candidates have reached a quota or are declared elected when the field of candidates is thinned to the number of remaining open seats in the quota borda system qbs the voters also cast their preferences 1234 as they wish in the analysis all 1st preferences are counted all 2nd preferences are counted after these preferences have been translated into points per the rules of a modified borda count mbc the candidates points are also counted seats are awarded to any candidates with a quota of 1st preferences to any pair of candidates with two quotas of 1st2nd preferences and if seats are still to be filled to those candidates with the highest mbc scores in a voting system that uses a ranked vote the voter ranks the candidates in order of preference for example they might mark a preference for bob in the first place then emily then alice then daniel and finally charlie ranked voting systems such as those used in australia and ireland use a ranked vote in a voting system that uses a scored vote or range vote the voter gives each alternative a number between one and ten the upper and lower bounds may vary see cardinal voting systems some multiplewinner systems such as the single nontransferable vote sntv used in afghanistan and vanuatu give a single vote or one vote per elector even though multiple members are being elected in the district the condorcet rule is used sometimes in decisionmaking the voters or elected representatives cast their preferences on one some or all options 1234 as in prstv or qbs in the analysis option a is compared to option b and if a is more popular than b then a wins this pairing next a is compared with option c then d and so on likewise b is compared with c d etc the option which wins the most pairings if there is one is the condorcet winner campaigns when elections are called politicians and their supporters attempt to influence policy by competing directly for the votes of constituents in what are called campaigns supporters for a campaign can be either formally organized or loosely affiliated and frequently utilize campaign advertising it is common for political scientists to attempt to predict elections via political forecasting methods the most expensive election campaign included us7 billion spent on the 2012 united states presidential election and is followed by the us5 billion spent on the 2014 indian general election timing the nature of democracy is that elected officials are accountable to the people and they must return to the voters at prescribed intervals to seek their mandate to continue in office for that reason most democratic constitutions provide that elections are held at fixed regular intervals in the united states elections for public offices are typically held between every two and six years in most states and at the federal level with exceptions for elected judic",
