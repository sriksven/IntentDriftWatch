    "traditional hedge funds with nearly 1 trillion in aum are increasing their crypto exposure",
    "the rise of digital deception how modern con artists exploit social media across every major social platform a new breed of opportunist has emerged they dress in designer clothes speak in seductive shortcuts and promise everything their desperate audience wants to hear overseas careers without qualifications instant wealth from obscure cryptocurrencies automated systems that generate passive income overnight these selfproclaimed experts dont teach they exploit vulnerability the evolution of the scam from polished to shameless the con has transformed previous generations of fraudsters invested heavily in their disguise professional studios expensive suits polished websites rented luxury cars they understood that selling dreams required looking the part the illusion needed maintenance todays operators have discovered something darker the facade no longer matters they film from cramped apartments with poor lighting they wear the same wrinkled shirt across multiple videos the exhaustion shows on their faces the desperation leaks through their forced smiles yet the promises grow larger sixfigure salaries milliondollar opportunities generational wealth the shame has vanished entirely point a camera at your face recycle the same lies collect a few dollars per thousand views repeat the math is simple if one hundred people believe and ten people pay thats enough to survive another week and film another hundred videos the business model of false hope these digital deceivers have cracked the code of the attention economy visibility translates directly to revenue their currency isnt truth but engagement their content comes fast and flashy packed with hollow phrases like proven system limited spots exclusive access and lifechanging opportunity behind the polished facade lies no verifiable track record no transparent methodology no legitimate success only repackaged deception optimized for maximum reach the irony is brutal they promise millions while surviving on pennies they guarantee sixfigure jobs while unable to afford basic presentation quality they sell financial freedom while clearly trapped in their own cycle of desperation targeting emotion over intelligence the strategy is deliberate bypass critical thinking and appeal directly to emotion people searching for opportunity become transactions those seeking escape become revenue streams success for these operators doesnt require accuracy only virality each view share and comment fills their accounts while draining their audience of both money and rational judgment the target audience often mirrors the gurus actual financial situation but the guru has discovered the ultimate shortcut instead of escaping poverty through legitimate work monetize the desperation of others still trapped in it the contrast with genuine expertise legitimate professionals operate differently they construct rather than convince they demonstrate processes instead of making proclamations they present evidence case studies and verifiable results but authenticity struggles against algorithms designed to reward controversy and emotion measured expertise gets buried beneath sensational content promising overnight transformation this creates a perverse marketplace where manufactured hype consistently outperforms substance the carnival barkers multiply while researchers educators and actual innovators watch their work ignored the expanding ecosystem of exploitation these operators thrive because their business model requires no shame only followers who believe transformation awaits behind a paywall theyre constructing pyramids of misinformation where each new believer becomes another foundation stone supporting someone elses wealth the pattern is predictable create urgency manufacture scarcity promise exclusivity deliver disappointment then vanish before accountability arrives rinse and repeat with a new persona platform or promise the visible desperation what makes the current era particularly brazen is the transparency of the fraud you can see the struggle in their environment the bare walls the poor audio quality the single angle shot because theres no room to move the camera the same background in every video because theres nowhere else to film they promise luxury while sitting in poverty they guarantee success while embodying failure and somehow this blatant contradiction no longer stops people from believing the algorithm rewards volume over quality so they produce content frantically each video another lottery ticket hoping someone somewhere will click and pay the antidote critical thinking the solution exists but demands discipline healthy skepticism before believing any claim demand evidence before investing time or money verify credentials treat extraordinary promises as red flags requiring extraordinary proof questions to ask what verifiable results can they demonstrate who independently validates their claims what happens to people who follow their advice why is urgency always part of their pitch if theyre so successful why does their presentation suggest otherwise look at what they have not what they promise a true millionaire doesnt need to convince you from a cluttered bedroom a genuine job placement expert doesnt beg for engagement real wealth whispers desperation screams in a digital marketplace saturated with deception your skepticism isnt cynicism its survival the most valuable thing these operators want isnt your money but something more fundamental your unquestioning belief protect it accordingly",

resilience science also available in portuguese and spanish highlights nine key takeaways on the topic satellite imagery of the hektoria glacier in antarctica found that it shrank by 50 in only two months from novemberdecember 2022 the paywalled study indicates that the glaciers retreat primarily resulted from an ice plain calving process rather than atmospheric or oceanic conditions as suggested previously presaging future disastrous glacier breakdown if larger glaciers retreat at a similar rate a paywalled study in nature sustainability concluded that regions more dependent on landoriginating water are more prone to insufficient rainwater supply and soil moisture deficits during the main growing season the study indicates that the tipping point for regions seems to be around 36 dependence on landoriginating water and that such locations are likely to become waterstressed east africa and the us midwest are of particular concern because of patterns of irrigation water storage and drought i honestly dont know why we bother paying attention to the cop climate conferencesthe entire thing seems to be a kabuki show longhijacked by energy companies who invariably succeed at blocking even the most modest of reforms now theyre just rubbing it in netzero is dead the eu passed a watered down climate agreement on wednesday before cop30 began the agreement targets a roughly 70 reduction of fossil fuel emissions by 2035 when compared to 1990 levels however that isnt legally binding and critics say that emissions outsourced by the bloc will not count towards their total however they did pass a binding decision to cut emissions by 90 by 2040 this cop brazil is pitching a 125b plan in a scheme that they believe will help about 75 tropical countries profit from protecting their rainforest the idea is simple governments and private investors pay into a large fund then the combined capital is plowed into emerging markets to generate profits which after interest repayments to investors flow to tropical countries with low deforestation rates as confirmed by satellite money comes first as always the united states is allegedly the elephant not in the room wielding an unspoken threat to sabotage serious climate commitments by tariffing or otherwise estranging smaller states that push for ambitious carbon biodiversity targets whats it going to take to make real environmental progress a nature communications psychology study evaluated peoples attitudes in four european countries plus nigeria and the us to answer this question they determined that there was a psychological distance between them and climate change they needed to feel like they were personally affected like with flooding extreme heat etc another successful intervention was to use the principles of system justification theory to frame climate change as threatening the participants way of life specific to their nation and promote climate action as the patriotic response approaches that emphasized the 99 consensus among scientists and the letter to future generations technique were not so helpful an expos into the sierra clubs dwindling influence suggests that their membership cratered after a hard shift towards social justice and away from pure environmentalism humans and other animals generally find effort aversive and avoid it even when exerting effort obtains rewards known as the theory of least effort or effort aversion this aversion to effort is magnified in social contexts where the direct benefit is not immediately for ourselves with people less willing to engage in effortful behaviours that help otherspeople were more willing to choose effortful actions to protect the environment and provide food when the positive impact was greater or the action was easiercomputational modelling precisely captured how individuals devalued proenvironmental benefits by the effort required to obtain them in the absence of intervention participants were more willing to work to provide food to prevent starvation than reduce carbon emissions to mitigate climate change however several psychological interventions particularly based on psychological distance and system justification significantly reduced this bias and increased relative proenvironmental motivation finally motivation to help the environment was associated with both climaterelevant

    "unsolved mystery of quadrigacx founder dead or alive part 2 gerald cotten if you havent read part 1 yet start here first part 1 you need the full context of gerald cottens suspicious death the 215 million theft and the strange circumstances in india before this theory will make sense a note before we begin the gerald cotten case remains officially unsolved his death has never been independently verified through exhumation or autopsy the missing cryptocurrency has never been fully recovered and several key figures have never been properly investigated what follows is speculative analysis but its not wild conspiracy theory this is based on documented facts established patterns of financial fraud criminal psychology and the logical connections between three people whose stories are far too convenient to accept at face value we are not saying this is definitely what happened were saying this is what the evidence could suggest if you stop taking everyones word at face value when multiple people benefit from a crime multiple people might be involved lets examine the theory that almost nobody is willing to say out loud let me add the chapter that should have been in the original story the one that makes the most sense if you stop assuming everyone is telling the truth the couple and the criminal a perfect triangle heres what we know for certain jennifer gerald jennifer robertson married cotten just months before his death inherited 96 million in assets claims she had absolutely no knowledge of the fraud was listed on property deeds and bank accounts accompanied him to india where he conveniently died has never been charged questioned under oath or called as a witness in criminal proceedings michael patryn omar dhanani michael patryn omar dhanani convicted identity fraudster and money launderer cofounded quadrigacx with cotten allegedly left in 2016 but most fraud occurred after that has expertise in creating false identities and disappearing resurfaced years later working in crypto under new aliases has never explained his real relationship with cotten or the missing money gerald cotten gerald cotten career scammer since age 15 ran the daytoday operations as ceo created the fake trading accounts signed his will 12 days before traveling to india died under suspicious circumstances or didnt die and is the greatest escape artist in crypto history now what if these three people werent separate actors in this drama what if they were partners the threeway con how it could have worked phase 1 building the infrastructure 20132016 patryn and cotten cofound quadrigacx patryn brings his expertise in money laundering and identity fraud cotten brings his experience running online ponzi schemes together they build canadas largest cryptocurrency exchange specifically designed to be defrauded why else would you create an exchange where only one person has access to the cold wallets thats not security protocol thats preparation for exactly what eventually happened patryn leaves in 2016 but this isnt a departure its strategic distancing he removes his name from public documents while maintaining hidden access and control now when the fraud is eventually discovered hes not officially involved phase 2 enter jennifer robertson 20162018 cotten meets robertson but what if she wasnt a naive girlfriend who had no idea what her fianc did for a living what if she was recruited specifically for the endgame think about it shes listed on property deeds she has access to accounts she accompanies him on business trips and she somehow never asks basic questions about how her boyfriend runs canadas largest crypto exchange entirely by himself with no backup systems that level of incuriosity is not normal its deliberate ignorance or its a performance cotten marries her because he needs a legitimate heir who can inherit his assets when he dies he cant leave everything to patryn because that would immediately raise suspicions but what about a grieving widow thats sympathetic thats a perfect vehicle for moving money phase 3 the exit strategy late 2018 by octobernovember 2018 the walls are closing in cibc has frozen 26 million customers are complaining the ponzi is collapsing they need an exit heres how the threeway con executes november 27 cotten signs his will leaving everything to robertson this is step one ensuring the assets are legally protected before the death november 28 cotten and robertson travel to india but what if patryn was already there waiting what if the honeymoon was actually the final meeting to coordinate the escape december 9 cotten dies in a hospital in india but consider these scenarios scenario robertson and patryn are in on it but something goes wrong maybe cotten actually dies because his partners decide hes a liability the plan was to fake the death but they make it real instead and split whatever money theyd already moved robertson plays the grieving widow perfectly because she genuinely didnt expect him to actually die decemberjanuary 2019 theres a full month between cottens death and quadrigacxs announcement what happened during that month maybe robertson and patryn were moving remaining funds cleaning up evidence and coordinating their stories the delay wasnt administrativeit was logistical they needed time to ensure everything was in place before triggering the investigation they knew was coming fortis hospital jaipur the evidence that supports this theory lets look at what actually happened after cottens death robertsons behavior she negotiated to keep 12 million in assets instead of having everything seized shes never been charged with any crime despite being married to and business partners with a man who stole 215 million shes never been compelled to testify under oath about what she knew she lives comfortably in canada with millions acquired through fraud shes given carefully managed media interviews where she maintains complete ignorance if you stole 215 million and needed someone to hold your legitimate assets while you disappeared wouldnt you want them to act exactly like jennifer robertson has acted patryns silence he disappeared from public view after quadrigacx collapsed he resurfaced under new identities in crypto projects hes never explained his real relationship with cotten hes never been investigated for his potential role in the fraud he has all the skills necessary to help someone disappear fake ids money laundering international connections if you needed help faking your death and creating a new identity wouldnt you want to partner with exactly someone like michael patryn the december 2022 bitcoin movements remember those 100 bitcoin that moved four years after cottens death ernst young didnt do it no known party did it but someone with access to the private keys did what if that someone was patryn accessing funds from a shared wallet structure that had always been part of the plan or what if it was cotten himself proving hes still alive the movement of those funds is evidence that someone involved in quadrigacx is still active still has access and still knows how to operate in the shadows michael patryn omar dhanani this theory makes the most sense think about the alternative were supposed to believe that cotten ran a massive fraud entirely alone his wife had no idea despite being on property deeds and bank accounts his cofounder with a criminal history of identity fraud had nothing to do with it cotten coincidentally died right when the fraud was being discovered in india where death certificates can be forged after signing his will 12 days earlier and nobody thought this was suspicious enough to verify the body that requires believing in an absurd number of coincidences but if you assume robertson and patryn were partners from the beginning everything makes sense the singleperson access to cold wallets was designed to enable the fake death exit strategy patryns 2016 departure was strategic distancing robertsons marriage was preparation for inheriting assets the india location was chosen because its perfect for faking deaths the timing was deliberate not coincidental the monthlong silence was coordination time the refusal to investigate is because powerful people know the truth and dont want it exposed the money question if this theory is correct wheres the money robertson has 12 million in legitimate assets that she successfully negotiated to keep thats her payment for playing the grieving widow and never breaking character patryn likely has whatever portion was moved to offshore accounts before the collapse potentially 50100 million in cryptocurrency remaining hidden funds that was successfully hidden and can be accessed slowly over years through mixing services and exchanges why nobody wants to investigate this heres the ugly truth actually investigating this theory would be devastating for everyone involved for canada it would mean admitting that not only did a massive fraud occur but that the widow walked away with millions and has never been properly investigated it would mean acknowledging that a convicted identity fraudster cofounded the countrys largest crypto exchange and was never properly vetted for victims it would mean acknowledging that the money is probably gone forever and that the three people most responsible are all living comfortably while 115000 people lost everything so instead everyone accepts the official story cotten died robertson knew nothing patryn wasnt involved and its just one of those unfortunate mysteries jennifer robartson the perfect crime if this theory is true they have executed something close to a perfect crime whether cotten is alive or dead almost doesnt matter at this point the con worked the money is gone and 2 people whether through planning or luck got away with it the question we should be asking the real question is not is cotten alive or dead the real question is why hasnt jennifer robertson been investigated why hasnt michael patryn been questioned why has nobody looked at the obvious possibility that this was a coordinated operation and the answer is probably simple because investigating would require admitting that the authorities missed it its easier to blame the dead guy even if he might not actually be dead somewhere right now two or three people know the truth about what happened to quadrigacx maybe one of them is in a grave in halifax maybe all three are alive and well living on different continents accessing their shares of 215 million through carefully structured cryptocurrency transactions that can never be fully traced well probably never know for sure because the people who could answer these questions have every reason not to and the authorities who could force them to answer have every reason not to ask thats how you get away with stealing 215 million you dont do it alone you do it with partners who can cover for each other when one of you needs to die and you pick partners who are very very good at keeping secrets michael patryn speculation vs investigation im not claiming to have solved this mystery im not saying i have proof what i am doing is pointing out patterns that deserve investigation and asking why nobody with actual authority seems interested in investigating them the truth is probably somewhere in the gray areas whether that someone is dead or alive is the mystery we may never solve what do you think drop your theories in the comments but remember keep it logical keep it evidencebased and keep it respectful to the 115000 people who lost everything",

    "a cryptocurrency colloquially crypto is a digital currency designed to work through a computer network that is not reliant on any central authority such as a government or bank to uphold or maintain it however a type of cryptocurrency called a stablecoin may rely upon government action or legislation to require that a stable value be upheld and maintained individual coin ownership records are stored in a digital ledger or blockchain which is a computerized database that uses a consensus mechanism to secure transaction records control the creation of additional coins and verify the transfer of coin ownership the two most common consensus mechanisms are proof of work and proof of stake despite the name which has come to describe many of the fungible blockchain tokens that have been created cryptocurrencies are not considered to be currencies in the traditional sense and varying legal treatments have been applied to them in various jurisdictions including classification as commodities securities and currencies cryptocurrencies are generally viewed as a distinct asset class in practice the first cryptocurrency was bitcoin which was first released as opensource software in 2009 as of june 2023 there were more than 25000 other cryptocurrencies in the marketplace of which more than 40 had a market capitalization exceeding 1 billion as of april 2025 the cryptocurrency market capitalization was already estimated at 276 trillion history in 1983 american cryptographer david chaum conceived of a type of cryptographic electronic money called ecash later in 1995 he implemented it through digicash an early form of cryptographic electronic payments digicash required user software in order to withdraw notes from a bank and designate specific encrypted keys before they could be sent to a recipient this allowed the digital currency to be untraceable by a third party in 1996 the national security agency published a paper entitled how to make a mint the cryptography of anonymous electronic cash describing a cryptocurrency system the paper was first published in an mit mailing list october 1996 and later april 1997 in the american law review in 1998 wei dai described bmoney an anonymous distributed electronic cash system shortly thereafter nick szabo described bit gold like bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies that would follow it bit gold not to be confused with the later goldbased exchange bitgold was described as an electronic currency system that required users to complete a proof of work function with solutions being cryptographically put together and published in january 2009 bitcoin was created by pseudonymous developer satoshi nakamoto it used sha256 a cryptographic hash function in its proofofwork scheme in april 2011 namecoin was created as an attempt at forming a decentralized dns in october 2011 litecoin was released which used scrypt as its hash function instead of sha256 peercoin created in august 2012 used a hybrid of proofofwork and proofofstake cryptocurrency has undergone several periods of growth and retraction including several bubbles and market crashes such as in 2011 2013201415 20172018 and 20212023 in august 2014 the uk announced its treasury had commissioned a study of cryptocurrencies and what role if any they could play in the uk economy the study was also to report on whether regulation should be considered its final report was published in 2018 and it issued a consultation on cryptoassets and stablecoins in january 2021 in june 2021 el salvador became the first country to accept bitcoin as legal tender after the legislative assembly had voted 6222 to pass a bill submitted by president nayib bukele classifying the cryptocurrency as such in august 2021 cuba followed with resolution 215 to recognize and regulate cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin in september 2021 the government of china the single largest market for cryptocurrency declared all cryptocurrency transactions illegal this completed a crackdown on cryptocurrency that had previously banned the operation of intermediaries and miners within china in september 2022 the worlds second largest cryptocurrency at that time ethereum transitioned its consensus mechanism from proofofwork pow to proofofstake pos in an upgrade process known as the merge according to the ethereum founder the upgrade would cut both ethereums energy use and carbondioxide emissions by 999 on 11 november 2022 ftx trading ltd a cryptocurrency exchange which also operated a crypto hedge fund and had been valued at 18 billion filed for bankruptcy the financial impact of the collapse extended beyond the immediate ftx customer base as reported while at a reuters conference financial industry executives said that regulators must step in to protect crypto investors technology analyst avivah litan commented on the cryptocurrency ecosystem that everythingneeds to improve dramatically in terms of user experience controls safety customer service formal definition according to jan lansky a cryptocurrency is a system that meets six conditions the system does not require a central authority its state is maintained through distributed consensus the system keeps an overview of cryptocurrency units and their ownership the system defines whether new cryptocurrency units can be created if new cryptocurrency units can be created the system defines the circumstances of their origin and how to determine the ownership of these new units ownership of cryptocurrency units can be proved exclusively cryptographically the system allows transactions to be performed in which ownership of the cryptographic units is changed a transaction statement can only be issued by an entity proving the current ownership of these units if two different instructions for changing the ownership of the same cryptographic units are simultaneously entered the system performs at most one of them in march 2018 the word cryptocurrency was added to the merriamwebster dictionary altcoins after the early innovation of bitcoin in 2008 and the early network effect gained by bitcoin tokens cryptocurrencies and other digital assets that were not bitcoin became collectively known during the 2010s as alternative cryptocurrencies or altcoins sometimes the term alt coins was used or disparagingly shitcoins paul vigna of the wall street journal described altcoins in 2020 as alternative versions of bitcoin given its role as the model protocol for cryptocurrency designers a polytechnic university of catalonia thesis in 2021 used a broader description including not only alternative versions of bitcoin but every cryptocurrency other than bitcoin as of early 2020 there were more than 5000 cryptocurrencies altcoins often have underlying differences when compared to bitcoin for example litecoin aims to process a block every 25 minutes rather than bitcoins 10 minutes which allows litecoin to confirm transactions faster than bitcoin another example is ethereum which has smart contract functionality that allows decentralized applications to be run on its blockchain ethereum was the most used blockchain in 2020 according to bloomberg news in 2016 it had the largest following of any altcoin according to the new york times significant market price rallies across multiple altcoin markets are often referred to as an altseason stablecoins stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable level of purchasing power notably these designs are not foolproof as a number of stablecoins have crashed or lost their peg for example on 11 may 2022 terras stablecoin ust fell from 1 to 26 cents the subsequent failure of terraform labs resulted in the loss of nearly 40b invested in the terra and luna coins in september 2022 south korean prosecutors requested the issuance of an interpol red notice against the companys founder do kwon in hong kong the expected regulatory framework for stablecoins in 202324 is being shaped and includes a few considerations memecoins memecoins are a category of cryptocurrencies that originated from internet memes or jokes the most notable example is dogecoin a memecoin featuring the shiba inu dog from the doge meme memecoins are known for extreme volatility for example the recordhigh value for a dogecoin was 73 cents but that had plunged to 13 cents by mid2024 scams are prolific among memecoins physical crypto physical cryptocurrency coins have been made as promotional items and some have become collectibles some of these have a private key embedded in them to access crypto worth a few dollars there have also been attempts to issue bitcoin bank notes the term physical bitcoin is used in the finance industry when investment funds that hold crypto purchased from crypto exchanges put their crypto holdings in a specialised bank called a custodian these physical representations of cryptocurrency do not hold any value by themselves these are only utilized for collectable purposes for example the first incarnation of the bitcoin casascius coins made of silver brass or aluminum sometimes with gold plating or titan bitcoin which in silver or gold versions are sought after by numismatists architecture cryptocurrency is produced by an entire cryptocurrency system collectively at a rate that is defined when the system is created and that is publicly stated in centralized banking and economic systems such as the us federal reserve system corporate boards or governments control the supply of currency in the case of cryptocurrency companies or governments cannot produce new units and have not so far provided backing for other firms banks or corporate entities that hold asset value measured in it the underlying technical system upon which cryptocurrencies are based was created by satoshi nakamoto within a proofofwork system such as bitcoin the safety integrity and balance of ledgers are maintained by a community of mutually distrustful parties referred to as miners miners use their computers to help validate and timestamp transactions adding them to the ledger in accordance with a particular timestamping scheme in a proofofstake blockchain transactions are validated by holders of the associated cryptocurrency sometimes grouped together in stake pools most cryptocurrencies are designed to gradually decrease the production of that currency placing a cap on the total amount of that currency that will ever be in circulation compared with ordinary currencies held by financial institutions or kept as cash on hand cryptocurrencies can be more difficult for seizure by law enforcement blockchain the validity of each cryptocurrencys coins is provided by a blockchain a blockchain is a continuously growing list of records called blocks which are linked and secured using cryptography each block typically contains a hash pointer as a link to a previous block a timestamp and transaction data by design blockchains are inherently resistant to modification of the data a blockchain is an open distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way for use as a distributed ledger a blockchain is typically managed by a peertopeer network collectively adhering to a protocol for validating new blocks once recorded the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all subsequent blocks which requires collusion of the network majority blockchains are secure by design and are an example of a distributed computing system with high byzantine fault tolerance decentralized consensus has therefore been achieved with a blockchain nodes a node is a computer that connects to a cryptocurrency network the node supports the cryptocurrencys network through either relaying transactions validation or hosting a copy of the blockchain in terms of relaying transactions each network computer node has a copy of the blockchain of the cryptocurrency it supports when a transaction is made the node creating the transaction broadcasts details of the transaction using encryption to other nodes throughout the node network so that the transaction and every other transaction is known node owners are either volunteers those hosted by the organization or body responsible for developing the cryptocurrency blockchain network technology or those who are enticed to host a node to receive rewards from hosting the node network timestamping cryptocurrencies use various timestamping schemes to prove the validity of transactions added to the blockchain ledger without the need for a trusted third party the first timestamping scheme invented was the proofofwork scheme the most widely used proofofwork schemes are based on sha256 and scrypt some other hashing algorithms that are used for proofofwork include cryptonote blake sha3 and x11 another method is called the proofofstake scheme proofofstake is a method of securing a cryptocurrency network and achieving distributed consensus through requesting users to show ownership of a certain amount of currency it is different from proofofwork systems that run difficult hashing algorithms to validate electronic transactions the scheme is largely dependent on the coin and there is currently no standard form of it some cryptocurrencies use a combined proofofwork and proofofstake scheme mining on a blockchain mining is the validation of transactions for this effort successful miners obtain new cryptocurrency as a reward the reward decreases transaction fees by creating a complementary incentive to contribute to the processing power of the network the rate of generating hashes which validate any transaction has been increased by the use of specialized hardware such as fpgas and asics running complex hashing algorithms like sha256 and scrypt this arms race for cheaperyetefficient machines has existed since bitcoin was introduced in 2009 mining is measured by hash rate typically in ths a 2023 imf working paper found that crypto mining could generate 450 million tons of co2 emissions by 2027 accounting for 07 percent of global emissions or 12 percent of the world total with more people entering the world of virtual currency generating hashes for validation has become more complex over time forcing miners to invest increasingly large sums of money to improve computing performance consequently the reward for finding a hash has diminished and often does not justify the investment in equipment and cooling facilities to mitigate the heat the equipment produces and the electricity required to run them popular regions for mining include those with inexpensive electricity a cold climate and jurisdictions with clear and conducive regulations by july 2019 bitcoins electricity consumption was estimated to be approximately 7 gigawatts around 02 of the global total or equivalent to the energy consumed nationally by switzerland some miners pool resources sharing their processing power over a network to split the reward equally according to the amount of work they contributed to the probability of finding a block a share is awarded to members of the mining pool who present a valid partial proofofwork as of february 2018 the chinese government has halted trading of virtual currency banned initial coin offerings and shut down mining many chinese miners have since relocated to canada and texas one company is operating data centers for mining operations at canadian oil and gas field sites due to low gas prices in june 2018 hydro quebec proposed to the provincial government to allocate 500 megawatts of power to crypto companies for mining according to a february 2018 report from fortune iceland has become a haven for cryptocurrency miners in part because of its cheap electricity in march 2018 the city of plattsburgh new york put an 18month moratorium on all cryptocurrency mining in an effort to preserve natural resources and the character and direction of the city in 2021 kazakhstan became the secondbiggest cryptocurrency mining country producing 181 of the global exahash rate the country built a compound containing 50000 computers near ekibastuz gpu price rise an increase in cryptocurrency mining increased the demand for graphics cards gpu in 2017 the computing power of gpus makes them wellsuited to generating hashes popular favorites of cryptocurrency miners such as nvidias gtx 1060 and gtx 1070 graphics cards as well as amds rx 570 and rx 580 gpus doubled or tripled in price or were out of stock a gtx 1070 ti which was released at a price of 450 sold for as much as 1100 another popular card the gtx 1060 6 gb model was released at an msrp of 250 and sold for almost 500 rx 570 and rx 580 cards from amd were out of stock for almost a year miners regularly buy up the entire stock of new gpus as soon as they are available nvidia has asked retailers to do what they can when it comes to selling gpus to gamers instead of miners boris bhles pr manager for nvidia in the german region said gamers come first for nvidia mining accelerator chips numerous companies developed dedicated cryptomining accelerator chips capable of priceperformance far higher than that of cpu or gpu mining at one point intel marketed its own brand of crypto accelerator chip named blockscale wallets a cryptocurrency wallet is a means of storing the public and private keys address or seed which can be used to receive or spend the cryptocurrency with the private key it is possible to write in the public ledger effectively spending the associated cryptocurrency with the public key it is possible for others to send currency to the wallet there exist multiple methods of storing keys or seed in a wallet these methods range from using paper wallets which are public private or seed keys written on paper to using hardware wallets which are hardware to store your wallet information to a digital wallet which is a computer with software hosting your wallet information to hosting your wallet using an exchange where cryptocurrency is traded or by storing your wallet information on a digital medium such as plaintext anonymity bitcoin is pseudonymous rather than anonymous the cryptocurrency in a wallet is not tied to a person but rather to one or more specific keys or addresses thereby bitcoin owners are not immediately identifiable but all transactions are publicly available in the blockchain still cryptocurrency exchanges are often required by law to collect the personal information of their users some cryptocurrencies such as monero zerocoin zerocash and cryptonote implement additional measures to increase privacy such as by using zeroknowledge proofs a recent 2020 study presented different attacks on privacy in cryptocurrencies the attacks demonstrated how the anonymity techniques are not sufficient safeguards in order to improve privacy researchers suggested several different ideas including new cryptographic schemes and mechanisms for hiding the ip address of the source economics cryptocurrencies are used primarily outside banking and governmental institutions and are exchanged over the internet block rewards proofofwork cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin offer block rewards incentives for miners there has been an implicit belief that whether miners are paid by block rewards or transaction fees does not affect the security of the blockchain but a study suggests that this may not be the case under certain circumstances the rewards paid to miners increase the supply of the cryptocurrency by making sure that verifying",
