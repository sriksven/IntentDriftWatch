    "an electric vehicle ev is a motor vehicle whose propulsion is powered fully or mostly by electricity evs encompass a wide range of transportation modes including road and rail vehicles electric boats and submersibles electric aircraft and electric spacecraft early electric vehicles first came into existence in the late 19th century when the second industrial revolution brought forth electrification and mass utilization of dc and ac electric motors using electricity was among the preferred methods for motor vehicle propulsion as it provided a level of quietness comfort and ease of operation that could not be achieved by the gasoline engine cars of the time but range anxiety due to the limited energy storage offered by contemporary battery technologies hindered any mass adoption of private electric vehicles throughout the 20th century internal combustion engines both gasoline and diesel engines were the dominant propulsion mechanisms for cars and trucks for about 100 years but electricitypowered locomotion remained commonplace in other vehicle types such as overhead linepowered mass transit vehicles like electric trains trams monorails and trolley buses as well as various small lowspeed shortrange batterypowered personal vehicles such as mobility scooters plugin hybrid electric vehicles use electric motors as the primary propulsion method rather than as a supplement and did not see any mass production until the late 2000s and battery electric cars did not become practical options for the consumer market until the 2010s progress in batteries electric motors and power electronics has made electric cars more feasible than during the 20th century as a means of reducing tailpipe emissions of carbon dioxide and other pollutants and to reduce the use of fossil fuels government incentives are available in many areas to promote the adoption of electric cars history electric motive power started in 1827 when hungarian priest nyos jedlik built the first rudimentary yet functional electric motor the next year he used it to power a small model car in 1835 professor sibrandus stratingh of the university of groningen in the netherlands built a miniature electric vehicle car and sometime between 1832 and 1839 robert anderson of scotland invented the first crude electric carriage powered by nonrechargeable primary cells american blacksmith and inventor thomas davenport built a toy electric locomotive powered by a primitive electric motor in 1835 in 1838 a scotsman named robert davidson built an electric locomotive that attained a speed of four miles per hour 6 kmh in england a patent was granted in 1840 for the use of rails as conductors of electric current and similar american patents were issued to lilley and colten in 1847 the first massproduced electric vehicles appeared in america in the early 1900s in 1902 the studebaker automobile company entered the automotive business with electric vehicles though it also entered the gasoline vehicles market in 1904 however with the advent of cheap assembly line cars by ford motor company the popularity of electric cars declined significantly due to a lack of electricity grids and the limitations of storage batteries at that time electric cars did not gain much popularity however electric trains gained immense popularity due to their economies and achievable speeds by the 20th century electric rail transport became commonplace due to advances in the development of electric locomotives over time the generalpurpose commercial use of electric cars was reduced to specialist roles as platform trucks forklift trucks ambulances tow tractors and urban delivery vehicles such as the iconic british milk float for most of the 20th century the uk was the worlds largest user of electric road vehicles electrified trains were used for coal transport as the motors did not use the valuable oxygen in the mines switzerlands lack of natural fossil resources forced the rapid electrification of their rail network one of the earliest rechargeable batteries the nickeliron battery was favored by edison for use in electric cars evs were among the earliest automobiles and before the preeminence of light powerful internal combustion engines ices electric automobiles held many vehicle land speed and distance records in the early 1900s they were produced by baker electric columbia electric detroit electric and others and at one point in history outsold gasolinepowered vehicles in 1900 28 percent of the cars on the road in the us were electric evs were so popular that even president woodrow wilson and his secret service agents toured washington dc in their milburn electrics which covered 6070 miles 100110 km per charge most producers of passenger cars opted for gasoline cars in the first decade of the 20th century but electric trucks were an established niche well into the 1920s several developments contributed to a decline in the popularity of electric cars improved road infrastructure required a greater range than that offered by electric cars and the discovery of large reserves of petroleum in texas oklahoma and california led to the wide availability of affordable gasolinepetrol making internal combustion powered cars cheaper to operate over long distances electric vehicles were seldom marketed as womens luxury car which may have been a stigma among male consumers also internal combustionpowered cars became evereasier to operate thanks to the invention of the electric starter by charles kettering in 1912 which eliminated the need of a hand crank for starting a gasoline engine and the noise emitted by ice cars became more bearable thanks to the use of the muffler which hiram percy maxim had invented in 1897 as roads were improved outside urban areas the electric vehicle range could not compete with the ice finally the initiation of mass production of gasolinepowered vehicles by henry ford in 1913 significantly reduced the cost of gasoline cars as compared to electric cars in the 1930s national city lines which was a partnership of general motors firestone and standard oil of california purchased many electric tram networks across the country to dismantle them and replace them with gm buses the partnership was convicted of conspiring to monopolize the sale of equipment and supplies to their subsidiary companies still it was acquitted of conspiring to monopolize the provision of transportation services the copenhagen summit conducted amid a severe observable climate change brought on by humanmade greenhouse gas emissions was held in 2009 during the summit more than 70 countries developed plans to reach net zero eventually for many countries adopting more evs will help reduce the use of gasoline in recent years the market for electric offroad motorcycles including dirt bikes has seen significant growth this trend is driven by advancements in battery technology and increasing demand for recreational electric vehicles experimentation in january 1990 general motors president introduced its ev concept twoseater the impact at the los angeles auto show that september the california air resources board mandated majorautomaker sales of evs in phases starting in 1998 from 1996 to 1998 gm produced 1117 ev1s 800 of which were made available through threeyear leases chrysler ford gm honda and toyota also produced limited numbers of evs for california drivers during this period in 2003 upon the expiration of gms ev1 leases gm discontinued them the discontinuation has variously been attributed to the auto industrys successful federal court challenge to californias zeroemissions vehicle mandate a federal regulation requiring gm to produce and maintain spare parts for the few thousand ev1s and the success of the oil and auto industries media campaign to reduce public acceptance of evs a movie made on the subject in 20052006 was titled who killed the electric car and released theatrically by sony pictures classics in 2006 the film explores the roles of automobile manufacturers oil industry the us government batteries hydrogen vehicles and the general public and each of their roles in limiting the deployment and adoption of this technology ford released a number of their ford ecostar delivery vans into the market honda nissan and toyota also repossessed and crushed most of their evs which like the gm ev1s had been available only by closedend lease after public protests toyota sold 200 of its rav4 evs they later sold at over their original fortythousanddollar price later bmw of canada sold off a number of mini evs when their canadian testing ended the production of the citron berlingo electrique stopped in september 2005 zenn started production in 2006 but ended by 2009 reintroduction during the late 20th and early 21st century the environmental impact of the petroleumbased transportation infrastructure along with the fear of peak oil led to renewed interest in electric transportation infrastructure evs differ from fossil fuelpowered vehicles in that the electricity they consume can be generated from a wide range of sources including fossil fuels nuclear power and renewables such as solar power and wind power or any combination of those recent advancements in battery technology and charging infrastructure have addressed many of the earlier barriers to ev adoption making electric vehicles a more viable option for a wider range of consumers the carbon footprint and other emissions of electric vehicles vary depending on the fuel and technology used for electricity generation the electricity may be stored in the vehicle using a battery flywheel or supercapacitors vehicles using internal combustion engines usually only derive their energy from a single or a few sources usually nonrenewable fossil fuels a key advantage of electric vehicles is regenerative braking which recovers kinetic energy typically lost during friction braking as heat as electricity restored to the onboard battery according to the international energy agencys global ev outlook 2024 more than 14 million new electric cars were sold worldwide in 2023 representing around 18 of total car sales for the year electricity sources evs are much more efficient than fossil fuel vehicles and have few direct emissions at the same time they do rely on electrical energy that is generally provided by a combination of nonfossil fuel plants and fossil fuel plants there are many ways to generate electricity of varying costs efficiency and ecological desirability evs can be made less polluting overall by modifying the source of electricity in some areas persons can ask utilities to provide their electricity from renewable energy therefore it gives the greatest degree of energy resilience connection to generator plants direct connection to electric grids as is common among electric trains trams trolleybuses and trolleytrucks see also overhead lines third rail and conduit current collection online electric vehicle collects power from electric power strips buried under the road surface through electromagnetic induction onboard generators and hybrid evs generated onboard using a diesel engine dieselelectric locomotive and dieselelectric multiple unit demu generated onboard using a fuel cell fuel cell vehicle generated onboard using nuclear energy nuclear submarines and aircraft carriers renewable sources such as solar power solar vehicle it is also possible to have hybrid evs that derive electricity from multiple sources such as onboard rechargeable electricity storage system ress and a direct continuous connection to landbased generation plants for purposes of onhighway recharging with unrestricted highway range onboard rechargeable electricity storage system and a fueled propulsion power source internal combustion engine plugin hybrid for especially large evs such as submarines the chemical energy of the dieselelectric can be replaced by a nuclear reactor the nuclear reactor usually provides heat which drives a steam turbine which drives a generator which is then fed to the propulsion see nuclear marine propulsion a few experimental vehicles such as some cars and a handful of aircraft use solar panels for electricity onboard storage these systems are powered from an external generator plant nearly always when stationary and then disconnected before motion occurs and the electricity is stored in the vehicle until needed full electric vehicles fev power storage methods include chemical energy stored on the vehicle in onboard batteries battery electric vehicle bev typically with a lithiumion battery kinetic energy storage flywheels static energy stored on the vehicle in onboard electric doublelayer capacitors batteries electric doublelayer capacitors and flywheel energy storage are forms of rechargeable onboard electricity storage systems by avoiding an intermediate mechanical step the energy conversion efficiency can be improved compared to hybrids by avoiding unnecessary energy conversions furthermore electrochemical batteries conversions are reversible allowing electrical energy to be stored in chemical form components the type of battery the type of traction motor and the motor controller design vary according to the size power and proposed application which can be as small as a motorized shopping cart or wheelchair through pedelecs electric motorcycles and scooters neighborhood electric vehicles industrial forklift trucks and including many hybrid vehicles battery an electricvehicle battery evb in addition to the traction battery specialty systems used for industrial or recreational vehicles are batteries used to power the propulsion system of a battery electric vehicle bevs these batteries are usually a secondary rechargeable battery and are typically lithiumion batteries traction batteries specifically designed with a high amperehour capacity are used in forklifts electric golf carts riding floor scrubbers electric motorcycles electric cars trucks vans and other electric vehicles lithiumion battery since their first commercial release in 1991 lithiumion batteries have become an important technology for achieving lowcarbon transportation systems most electric vehicles use lithiumion batteries liions or libs lithiumion batteries have a higher energy density longer life span and higher power density than most other practical batteries complicating factors include safety durability thermal breakdown environmental impact and cost liion batteries should be used within safe temperature and voltage ranges to operate safely and efficiently increasing the batterys lifespan decreases effective costs and environmental impact one technique is to operate a subset of the battery cells at a time and switching these subsets in the past nickelmetal hydride batteries were used in some electric cars such as those made by general motors these battery types are considered outdated due to their tendencies to selfdischarge in the heat furthermore a patent for this type of battery was held by chevron which created a problem for their widespread development these factors coupled with their high cost has led to lithiumion batteries leading as the predominant battery for evs the prices of lithiumion batteries have declined dramatically over the past decade contributing to a reduction in price for electric vehicles but an increase in the price of critical minerals such as lithium from 2021 to the end of 2022 has put pressure on historical battery price decreases electric motor the power of a vehicles electric motor as in other machines is measured in kilowatts kw electric motors can deliver their maximum torque over a wide rpm range this means that the performance of a vehicle with a 100 kw electric motor exceeds that of a vehicle with a 100 kw internal combustion engine which can only deliver its maximum torque within a limited range of engine speed efficiency of charging varies considerably depending on the type of charger and energy is lost during the process of converting the electrical energy to mechanical energy usually direct current dc electricity is fed into a dcac inverter where it is converted to alternating current ac electricity and this ac electricity is connected to a 3phase ac motor for electric trains forklift trucks and some electric cars dc motors are often used in some cases universal motors are used and then ac or dc may be employed in recent production vehicles various motor types have been implemented for instance induction motors within tesla motor vehicles and permanent magnet machines in the nissan leaf and chevrolet bolt energy and motors electric motors are mechanically very simple and often achieve 90 energy conversion efficiency over the full range of speeds and power output and can be precisely controlled motion is provided by a rotary electric motor however it is possible to unroll the motor to drive directly against a special matched track these linear motors are used in maglev trains which float above the rails supported by magnetic levitation this allows for almost no rolling resistance of the vehicle and no mechanical wear and tear of the train or track in addition to the highperformance control systems needed switching and curving of the tracks becomes difficult with linear motors which to date has restricted their operations to highspeed point to point services electric traction allows the use of regenerative braking in which the motors are used as brakes and become generators that transform the motion of usually a train into electrical power that is then fed back into the lines this system is particularly advantageous in mountainous operations as descending vehicles can produce a large portion of the power required for those ascending and in startandstop city use this regenerative system is only viable if the system is large enough to use the power generated by descending vehicles they can be finely controlled and provide high torque from stationarytomoving unlike internal combustion engines and do not need multiple gears to match power curves this removes the need for gearboxes and torque converters evs provide quiet and smooth operation and consequently have less noise and vibration than internal combustion engines while this is a desirable attribute it has also evoked concern that the absence of the usual sounds of an approaching vehicle poses a danger to blind elderly and very young pedestrians to mitigate this situation many countries mandate warning sounds when evs are moving slowly up to a speed when normal motion and rotation road suspension electric motor etc noises become audible electric motors do not require oxygen unlike internal combustion engines this is useful for submarines and for space rovers vehicle types it is generally possible to equip any kind of vehicle with an electric powertrain ground vehicles pureelectric vehicles a pureelectric vehicle or allelectric vehicle is powered exclusively through electric motors the electricity may come from a battery battery electric vehicle solar panel solar vehicle or fuel cell fuel cell vehicle hybrid evs there are different ways that a hybrid electric vehicle can combine the power from an electric motor and the internal combustion engine the most common type is a parallel hybrid that connects the engine and the electric motor to the wheels through mechanical coupling in this scenario the electric motor and the engine can drive the wheels directly series hybrids only use the electric motor to drive the wheels and",
