    "wondering how long i should keep in 2020 xc90 t6 hey guys canadian owner here i have a 2020 xc90 t6 polestar r design i have put around 150k on it and am now thinking about when to get a new vehicle i put in a lot of kms family road trips and with work it has been a pretty good car only work i have had done was regular maintenance front visor needing to be replaced and the unfortunate supercharger going needing to be replaced and a current issue of the front driver headlight seal that is cracked causing condensation and sometimes not functioning during the day minor electrical stuff like the kick to open trunk stopped working and the key fob is a bit temperamental the interior build quality has stood up and almost looks new as i keep my cars in good shape what i am asking for is how much longer do you think i need to keep the car i drive around 2k a month i dont have a warranty of the vehicle what i am asking is does anyone have any higher mileage xc90s here did anyone get the newer model with either the mild hybrid or hybrid what is your experience from the older xc90 to the newer ones in terms of comfort suspension and road noise i am thinking of getting a new one soon just not sure when to pull the trigger or keep driving it until 2027 when i should be closer to 200k i asked for a quote from clutch and they came back at around 17k for the vehicle i should mention its been in 2 accidents with only cosmetic damage i really like it but i find the engine is a bit underwhelming loud and the suspension on the 2020 is really rough any input would be great",
    "took my car in for the streaming update i went for the tire recall but spoke to the service manager yesterday about the software update they stated they could just perform the update at my appointment today when finished they told me everything was updated but nothing is different the last update i have is from october 29th 65310 why are we seeing such a pushback from these dealerships when requesting software updates or really push back when we request anything for these vehicles ive previously posted about the gas lighting i got over the dash mat service bulletin also the technician stated that if i do not have an issue with my vehicle software updates are not covered by general motors i would have to pay for them myself excuse me what this is just a lease and im absolutely not getting another general motors electric vehicle after this",

class euclid special containment procedures scp2776 is to be contained in a high security leadlined humanoid domicile at area 11 no fewer than four heavily armed security personnel are to be stationed outside of the domicile in the event of an attempted breach of containment security personnel are to first activate the wenssnewton electromagnet located beneath the domicile if scp2776 manages to disable the device or leave its area of influence security personnel are to attempt to subdue scp2776 using class iii liveshock charges should scp2776 manage to escape the confines of the primary containment structure security personnel are authorized to apply lethal force to prevent a full breach of containment in order to prevent any attempts at breaching containment scp2776 must be made to believe the following information regardless of whether or not it is true the united states of america exists as a free democracy great britain its citizenry or any party originating within its borders does not pose a threat to the safety and stability of america or any of its assets the french republic exists and is not threatened by the united kingdom failure to ensure that scp2776 is not exposed to anything that contradicts the information above will activate scp2776 and will likely result in a containment breach description scp2776 is a humanoid automaton bearing the aged likeness of deceased senior british army officer george washington which held the office of president of the united states from april 30th 1789 to march 4th 1797 for more information about the origin of scp2776 please see addendum 27763 scp2776 consists of several features which fit the technological capabilities of the time during which it is believed to have been created including a crude iron skeleton wooden support struts glass eyes and mid18th century dental prosthesis however scp2776 also consists of many additional highly advanced features such as a smooth carbonbased base skin layer kinetically resistant armored plating within the chest a small fusion reactor to supply power to the assembly and a currently unknown information processing unit within the skull made entirely of graphene the outer flesh of scp2776 as well as the hair and nails are all organic and are resistant to decay the primary mechanical driver of scp2776 is an electric motor situated in the upper chest cavity but power can be directly administered to any of scp2776s faculties from the nuclear core by way of superheated wiring that interacts in some way with an unknown mechanical system within scp2776s skeleton this is believed to be the main driving power behind most of scp2776s anomalous capabilities but due to the sheer power output scp2776 is capable of during activation it is believed that power must be originating from another source within scp2776 research into this is ongoing scp2776 has two primary modes of operation the first is a lowenergy default mode wherein scp2776 expends relatively very little energy and exhibits signs of sapience and sentience scp2776 believes that it is george washington born in virginia british america and was at one point the commanderinchief of the continental army and later the president of the united states scp2776 is unable to justify its automatonic makeup stating that it has always been this way the secondary mode of operation a highenergy mode is activated only when scp2776 encounters information that contradicts the three pieces of information presented above while in its activated mode scp2776 data expunged see addendum 27764 for more information addendum 27761 discovery scp2776 was first discovered during a 2007 raid on a marshall carter and dark distributor acting out of roanoke virginia during the raid several documents were uncovered describing the existence of a dangerous anomalous object located in fairfax county virginia mobile task force beta24 pioneers was dispatched to secure the object located below the fairfax campus of george mason university below is an excerpt of the mtf field report in the back of the facilities building we found a covered access shaft no wider than half a meter or less we measured the depth at about ten meters and descended in single file the walkway tunnel below was tall enough that we didnt need to crouch but not wide enough to stand sidebyside as we approached the end of the hall thomas noted that there were several sidetunnels which looked to have been collapsed at some point there was a gas lighting system in place as well but it looked inoperable at the end of the hall was a single door with three sliding bolt locks about as thick as my arm the door was made of iron the bolts themselves were rusted shut so we had to wait to get a torch down to cut through it once we did we opened the door to the room he was in it wasnt any bigger than a standard containment cell here maybe a little higher furnishings were scarce but it was homey walls were paneled wood and papered floor was hardwood a carpet a small bookshelf and nightstand a few gas lanterns and him laying on the bed might as well have been dead to the world didnt move an inch when we walked in he was hooked up to this machine through these big copper pipes really steampunk definitely didnt fit the appearance of the rest of the room as we were setting up lights in the room avery tripped on one of the pipes and jarred it loose he woke up when it disconnected none of us recognized him at first you know because he doesnt really look like he does in the pictures he introduced himself and we thought he was full of shit i didnt even believe it until i saw the stuff they pulled from the raid and even now im still not sure whatever he is he was down there for a long time after a quick status check and rundown we got him moved out to a secure vehicle and shipped to site23 he was cooperative the whole time didnt say much didnt seem very sure about the car but we assured him he was fine addendum 27762 interview the following interview took place shortly after scp2776 was processed by containment specialists at site23 dr richards good afternoon sir scp2776 and to you dr richards do you know where you are scp2776 i do not though i find that i must not know many things after all i have seen today dr richards did the men you spoke to earlier say anything about what we do at this facility scp2776 they used the word containment liberally i assume this is a prison dr richards no no not a prison more like a laboratory for research scp2776 am i a subject dr richards for the time being yes do you know what year it is scp2776 i i believe it was december yes i was ill and the physicians were i believe martha was there as well where is she dr richards some time has passed since your reported death im afraid two hundred years scp2776 does not respond dr richards are you alright scp2776 the lord should have taken me i remember feeling the life leaving my body i spoke for the last time and then the darkness i do not understand dr richards during our initial inspection we noted several abnormal parts of your physiology features that were not human it is possible that a malfunction of your power supply activated some kind of emergency power reserve system gave your internal mechanisms time to repa scp2776 what power supply mechanisms speak now what are you implying dr richards you are uh as far as we can tell animatronic a machine scp2776 this but martha she never scp2776 does not respond to further questioning scp2776 remained unresponsive throughout the remainder of its processing examinations and only began speaking again once reaching containment at site70 addendum 27763 recovered documents the following documents were recovered during a raid on a marshall carter and dark distributor in roanoke virginia united states t i understand your concerns and my fellows in boston share them we do simply lack the firepower to mount any kind of assault domestic or foreign with any chance of success this much is certain through my communications with eh as mentioned in our previous correspondence there is a gentleman in my colleagues acquaintance who may prove invaluable to our cause he is a professor of the sciences and is working on no small number of truly remarkable projects i have advised my colleague to seek his counsel immediately and we can begin discussions with him once we have an agreement among ourselves i await your reply j mr tolliver as we discussed before it is imperative for the sake of a believable product that i am supplied with the likeness of one who would most fittingly take up the mantle you are intending the machine to hold this is the most imperative step as a misstep here will ruin any credibility the final product has the final decision is yours of course the apparatus can be modified to fit whomever you choose however if i were to make a recommendation there is a young officer from virginia who has recently taken ill after combat at the monongahela if i am not mistaken it is believed he will not see the months end a tragedy no doubt but a young officer with antiimperial sentiments is a fine basis to start with the officer is one george washington and he serves with general braddock in the ohio country you must reach him before he passes and ensure that he drinks the preparatory tea i am sending along to you in this correspondence this will ease his passing and ensure that the vital instruments of his being remain intact once you have a corpse remove it in silence none must know of his passing pack him in the manner i have explained and have it sent to me on the next ship bound for france i will do the rest he will need a wife upon his return someone you can trust to maintain him his wounds will not hurt him but they will be visible she will need to understand his inner mechanisms and be able to make adjustments to them as needed i have one such woman in my employ and am willing to have her accompany him back to virginia he will also need an estate where he can go to be in private he will be your battlefield commander and inspire confidence within your numbers but he cannot be seen publicly for we risk shattering the illusion if he is inspected upon too closely it will be preferable if this estate is near a river for other mechanical reasons i will accompany him when he returns as well see to it that the preparations are made and you will have your commander yours truly durand t i have seen him with mine own eyes and he is glorious no less of a man than i have ever beheld even upon close inspection the man durand did not lie to us this is our general and our king if need be he resides now within his estate at mt vernon with his wife the woman martha who accompanied durand from france she is a thing of wonder herself i have never seen a woman so adept at handling the intricate manners of machinery as she i suspect she may have assisted durand with the assembly of our mr washington the time is coming soon when we will need to begin i have spoken to benjamin and he supports a move forward contact the philadelphia men and we may begin putting the wheels in motion j mr tolliver your fears are unsubstantiated i am happy to report i know these early losses may be difficult to take but they are necessary to deliver a believable outcome a landslide victory resulting in few american deaths is preferable yes but unbelievable and this is the more important thing do not forget it if the tides of battle turn away from you do not be concerned mr washington will not lose the war and you will have your independence yours truly durand addendum 27764 incident report enter level 42776 authorizationjavascript access

what was believed to be a possible breach of containment at 1012 local time an updated distress signal was received containing images of destruction an estimated body count and a general request for additional aid mtf alpha30 and gamma10 were both mobilized from sites 19 and 23 respectively at 1132 local time mtf a19 reported live combat with an unknown entity mtf a19 continued to report live combat for another hour until mtf g10 arrived of the fifteen members of a19 only three survived mtf g10 arrived and with the assistance of air superiority managed to bring down the unidentified entity which had at this point leveled site70 and caused the death of no fewer than eightyfive research and security staff members as well as the majority of mtf a19 shortly after the arrival of mtf a30 it was discovered that the entity in question was scp2776 which was shortly moved to maximum security containment to await further processing an investigation into the breach of containment was launched and it was discovered that scp2776 first began to show abnormal behaviour after watching a television program describing a recent buyout of an american telecom company by a british media company scp2776s internal temperature immediately spiked to 400c and began to emit massive amounts of gamma radiation from its core scp2776 then underwent a series of physiological changes a series of highpowered energy emitting devices which until then had been located within the entitys arms burst through the skin the entitys back opened to reveal an incinerating weapon and the side of the face opened to reveal some kind of gas vent that began propelling a thick white smoke scp2776 then began to move along a path which trajectory analysis concluded would lead it to london england and met all resistance to its approach with lethal force individuals who approached scp2776 were either caught in the range of its energyemitting devices or incinerating device and those who grew too close would succumb to the effects of the white gas which appeared to coat the individuals in a fine layer of liquid mist biological material covered in the mist did not seem to be able to cease life functions until the mist had dissipated it was later discovered that one of the energyemitting devices was designed solely to cause cancer in biological subjects that passed through its area of influence the effects of this were only discovered during autopsies of afflicted individuals as the subjects in question did not live long enough for their condition to develop after the events of february 15th 2009 scp2776 was moved to its current location at area11 onsite personnel have noted a significant change in behaviour since scp2776 was initially activated as scp2776 no longer attempts to socialize or communicate with researchers in any way unless questioned directly and does not address foundation staff unless to request food water or a bible for study the latter of which has been denied

    "constant issues with powerwall 3 hi reddit community background context ive had my system since october 15th and its been nothing but constant issues since day one the installation was handled by a reputable installer who also set up my new solar system and batteries whenever i try to contact tesla for support the app redirects me back to the installer and the installer keeps getting unhelpful responses like your powerwall 3s wifi signal is weak try using a wifi extender the thing is im running an eero wholehome mesh network and the powerwall is literally five feet away from one of the nodes im hoping someone here can shed some light on whats going on a coworker of mine also has a powerwall 3 and his setup has been running flawlessly the key difference is that his entire system panels battery and wall connector is all tesla my configuration is a bit more mixed two separate systems one export and one nonexport due to nem 20 vs 30 and i imagine many others are in a similar situation trying to take advantage of the 30 tax credit before the end of the year system setup solar legacy solar system export nem 20 12 panels 3685 kw with sunpower new system nonexport due to being pushed to nem 30 if export 23 panels 1058 kw dc with rec 460aa purerx 2 powerwall 3 with inverters batteries two tesla powerwall 3s with inverters wall connector tesla wall connector 3rd gen grid disconnect tesla backup switch meter collar hardware configuration the rec system is connected to the two powerwall 3s the powerwall 3s are connected to my electrical panel the old sunpower system is also connected to the same electrical panel app configuration backup reserve is set to 10 i have tried both selfpowered and timebased control but no change in behavior permission to export no grid charging no i have tried netzeros automations and no change in effect goals and expectations peakhour coverage use the powerwalls to power the entire home during pges most expensive timeofuse periods where electricity costs reach 050kwh partpeak and 061kwh peak this helps minimize grid reliance and reduce utility bills nighttime cycle management allow the powerwalls to discharge overnight especially when charging the model y bringing them down to around their reserve level this ensures they can fully recharge with solar the next day once the sun is up grid independence avoid drawing any energy from the grid unless the powerwalls are already at reserve the goal is to stay as selfsufficient as possible since california electricity prices are extremely high midday vehicle charging strategy when charging the cybertruck around lunchtime have the powerwalls discharge first down to their target state of charge soc before pulling from the grid andor solar this helps maximize the use of stored energy and solar production during daylight hours powerwall 3 problems midday solar throttling im noticing that my solar production drops sharply in the middle of the day even under clear skies with no clouds during these drops my powerwall 3s are typically between 20 and 80 state of charge as an example so theyre nowhere near full despite that solar output appears to be throttled for no clear reason the next day production might follow a nearperfect charging curve and then the problem reappears the following day inconsistent overnight charging behavior when i charge my model y overnight the system behaves inconsistently sometimes it pulls entirely from the powerwalls while other times it splits the load between the powerwalls and the grid my goal is to discharge the batteries to around 10 before sunrise so solar can recharge them efficiently the next day otherwise it feels like wasted stored energy grid usage during peak pricing no ev charging here during partpeak and peak hours my powerwalls often still have plenty of energy remaining yet the system draws power from the grid instead of the powerwalls this defeats the purpose of having them the whole point is to avoid expensive grid usage and rely on stored energy when rates are highest unexpected grid exporting occasionally the system exports small amounts of energy back to the grid even though permission to export is set to no grid charging when disabled resolved early on the system would pull power from the grid to charge the powerwalls despite grid charging being disabled this issue seems to have stopped but it raises questions about software stability loads pulling from grid instead of powerwalls when running large household loads like the laundry or dishwasher the system often pulls from the grid instead of the powerwalls even when the powerwalls have a high state of charge with two powerwall 3s each with its own inverter this shouldnt be happening as they should have enough capacity to handle these loads directly powerwalls entering standby mode after peak hours end the powerwalls sometimes switch to standby mode instead of continuing to discharge even when they still have a high state of charge soc any insight or advice would be greatly appreciated i have a feeling that other powerwall owners who are trying to take advantage of the federal tax credit while still

    "a japanese person who loves sichuan cuisine goes to chengdu sichuan province china i visited chengdu in the autumn of 2025 and would like to share my impressions my goal is to let people in china especially those in sichuan know how their city looks from a japanese perspective about me japanese male in his 30s living in tokyo i love sichuan cuisine ive probably visited 200 sichuan restaurants around tokyo ranging from places i go to dozens of times to ones i left almost immediately because they didnt suit my taste however im not particularly good with extremely spicy food the purpose of this trip was to eat authentic sichuan cuisine i visited wuhan and changsha 9 years ago but this was my first time in chengdu i have never traveled to western countries changes felt compared to 9 years ago wuhanchangsha there might be regional differences but this is what i felt fewer people smoking less litter on the streets fewer people talking loudly fewer mischievousnoisy children more people waiting in line properly fewer group walking arminarm in the streets food experiences chen mapo tofu main branch known as the restaurant where mapo tofu originated the mapo tofu was 100 times spicier than the tokyo branch and i almost fainted an elegant lady next to me was eating mapo tofu vigorously without sweating a drop which i found terrifying i visited again later and asked for less spice this time but was told it wasnt possible so i ordered a different dish the dan dan noodles had a seasoning id never tasted before and were quite delicious sichuan dishes at other restaurants tasted similar to authentic chinese restaurants in tokyo meaning places that dont cater to japanese tastes but keep the original local flavors which made me realize the high reproducibility in tokyo i wanted to try hot pot in chengdu but the mapo tofu incident traumatized me so i couldnt go the number of skewers in chuanchuanxiang is insane isnt it hard to stick them all my apologies i had to leave this much mapo tofu chuanchuanxiang people kindness at one sichuan restaurant a staff member kindly used a translation app to ask about my preferences and narrowed down the dishes for me at that time he explained the characteristics of sichuan cuisine and when i mentioned that chen mapo tofu was too spicy he laughed and said but it was delicious right i thought it was very good that they have pride in their local cuisine is not being able to make mapo tofu less spicy a form of pride i just said it was delicious but now i wish i had said something to make her happier like it was better than in tokyo or your restaurant is also delicious at caffe i didnt know how to order via the miniapp so a staff member ordered for me using her personal smartphone and i transferred the money to her i was often asked to take photos or asked for directions why ask me a japanese person when there are so many other chinese people around life i didnt use cash at all during the entire trip there were many shops that were empty and the staff seemed bored making me wonder how they earn an income to live chengdu seemed to have more skyscrapers than tokyo tianfu square transportation i felt that cars motorbikes and bicycles run quite freely there were so many shared bicycles parked that it looked like an oversupply evs electric vehicles i thought they were very widespread however i didnt see any charging stations at all maybe i just didnt look closely enough it was scary when silent electric motorbikes passed right by me while walking in japan byd is often featured in economic content as the champion of evs but i didnt see many byd cars in chengdu internet information about the metro was old and incorrect so i ended up taking some detours shared bicycles stretching into the distance green license plates are for evs fashion fashion styles in places like chunxi road were unique and different from tokyo uniqlo is more expensive than in tokyo chinese people who look like japanese often wear anime character keychains sightseeing landmarks i felt there were few foreign tourists other than chinese westerners southeast asians judged by my own observation there was some litter on the ground maybe tokyo is just too clean mount qingcheng the laojun pavilion at the end felt like a lategame stage in the japanese game battle hshin based on investiture of the gods with fog creating a great atmosphere chengdu research base of giant panda breeding in japan its not uncommon to gratefully line up for an hour just to see one panda only to find it sleeping so i was surprised to see so many however perhaps because the park is so large there were so many pandas and so many panda motifs everywhere that i actually got panda fatigue though it must be irresistible for panda lovers the panda that doesnt move hotels i stayed at a fourstarexpedia hotel consumables like toothbrushes were replaced every day which i thought was wasteful maybe there was a sign saying no need to replace but i might have missed it there was no selfservice laundry and the laundry service was expensive so i didnt use it thank you very much chengdu next time i think ill go to chongqing first and then to chengdu again",

back it up capable of tackling dirt grass and mild inclines with ease why choose gas power the ultimate offroad edge in a world moving toward electric why would you choose a gaspowered model for an offroad machine the advantages are clear the bottom line is simple gas power means more power for more time in more places unmatched power and torque electric motors are great but for climbing hills

    "wont my truck alternator eventually overcharge my truck campers battery lead acid i was reviewing the electrical wiring of my truck camper and how it charges its battery and i noticed that it doesnt have a dedicated charger it simply connects the trucks 7pin towing plug from alternator to the battery terminals i have a leadacid battery typical for this truck camper tc model year 2004 which in theory is prone to overcharging if you were to just keep it connected to a dumb charger for an extended time and as far as i understand a safe leadacid battery charger is supposed to work in three phases 1 phase i bulk varies 2 phase ii absorption 144v 3 phase iii float 136138v i feel like i might be missing something but it seems like if im just plugging the alternator straight into my battery because the alternator doesnt have those three charging phases and is supposed to just keep the voltage relatively constant at 142144v on mine then im going to eventually overcharge the battery if i were to drive lets say 10 hours a day for multiple days especially because the alternator is also connected to my vehicle battery it wont be able to really detect that the battery voltage of the truck camper battery will be changing as it gets charged since it will also be seeing the voltage of the vehicle battery and probably setting its output voltage based on what the truck battery needs rather than the truck camper battery i can believe that truck camper manufacturers back in 2004 completely disregarded the safety risk of doing that but it would still seem somewhat surprising to me when leadacid batteries have been around for so long that this would be overlooked so what am i potentially missing",

    "30 days across japan in novdec 2024 part ii heres my longoverdue assortment of notes tips from a family trip last year unfortunately some of it is already too late for the 2025 season but we did a few things that i hadnt seen extensive coverage on so i hope to add some new information to the conversation for future travellers this follows on from the previous part and starts at setouchi i had to split the posts as i exceeded the character limit setouchi 28 november 2 december hiroshima without minimising its significance im not convinced that the peace memorial park should be the automatic recommendation that it tends to be its a heavy experience and youll want to be in the right headspace for it look out for special exhibitions that may be running on the day we caught one on the akatsuki corps the park wasnt overly crowded while we were there several okonomiyaki restaurants around the city are closed on thursdays so we ended up in okonomimura it was lacking some ambience outside of peak times but on the plus side we were seated immediately and the food was plenty good for what it is i was looking forward to the etsetora sightseeing train but i mistimed the ticket availability and ended up missing out kunoshima this island felt like setouchi in a bottle there is a path circumnavigating the island but you can also take some routes inland to the summit for stunning views of the inland sea theres enough here to fill 4 hours if youre up for a hike while there werent hordes of rabbits we bumped into a fair number of them scattered across the island they appeared to be generally wellfed by foot traffic with a mix of pellets hay and fresh vegetables theres plentiful parking at tadanmi port and it wasnt too busy outside of a tour bus and school excursion i was initially hoping we could continue onward to sakari port but i couldnt find any bus routes running through that port go did not service the area and our hotel in hiroshima wasnt willing to organise a taxi in a different prefecture ehime i only realised after leaving that didi was available nearby so maybe the connection is doable we ended up renting a car for peace of mind and it turned out to be almost essential to cover the 40minute walk between our accommodation and the coin laundry konbini port and restaurants in setoda shimanami kaid we split onomichi setoda and setoda imabari across two days this pacing worked well and allowed us to indulge in longer breaks for food and scenery despite initial concerns with the sections of the route that ran along roads i never felt unsafe in practice i imagine drivers in the area are highly cognisant of cyclists we took a ferry from setoda port to onomichi to begin the initial 750am flight of the lazuli was 15 minutes late with no announcements nor ways to track its whereabouts that i could figure out the subsequent ferry connection from onomichi to mukaishima was far more punctual running every 12 minutes shimanami japan has a network of rental stations conveniently plotted along the blue line on this map i can corroborate prior recommendations of their electric assist bikes they were perfectly sufficient for the route and the frontmounted baskets were handy to store belongings and souvenirs we had one ebike on the first day and it didnt feel worth the price hike and lack of storage i overcomplicated our reservations by switching to new bikes on the second day you can reserve the electric assists across multiple days and swap out their batteries where required at the rental stations i ended up covering the blue line and mt kiro on the equivalent of a single charge anyway the mountain is a legit incline even with the electric assist so youll want to reserve some energy for it the sights of the archipelago alone may have been enough but when you mix in the cycling infrastructure spanning bridges citrusstuffed mochi and hiroshima okonomiyaki this was the undisputed highlight of our trip while on the theme of food quality was high across the board in the region the seafood in particular was outstanding from kaki fry to ebi croquettes a lot of restaurants around setoda close earlier than their advertised opening hours but we were still lucky to find a soba sake restaurant at 8pm on a sunday okayama krakuen looks pictureperfect with okayama castle as a backdrop its well worth taking a stroll around the garden and a break at one of its teahouses as a general word of warning limitedtime items you may see promoted on websites like soranews24 are likely to turn over quickly in favour of new seasonals we were on the hunt for starbucks bizen mugs but none of the four stores around okayama station had them anymore skipped towel museum i was eyeing the peter rabbit exhibition running at the time but given we arrived at imabari at 430pm this wasnt worth rushing for seto ohashi bridge we didnt end up driving through shikoku so it no longer made much sense tky 27 december tky starbucks is easy to hate but the roastery hereone of only three outside of americais truly special there are four floors and multiple menus to explore and between tea cocktails and seasonal items you dont have to care for their coffee to have a great experience we were able to walk in without any wait in the evening tower records shibuya is a tribute to physical media i was taken aback by its sheer scale and the signed artist areas scattered around the store if you have at least a passing interest in japanese media youll love this i was hit by a wave of nostalgia entering pokmon center dx but with the 25th anniversary merch that released not even two weeks prior completely sold out i ended up largely lost amongst the goods for newer generations shibuya sky was a surprisingly solid experience the peak hours approaching sunset sell out instantly but we still had an enjoyable time heading up during a later timeslot i had assumed it would be packed to the brim but the crowds and capacity seem to be very deliberately controlled such that it never felt claustrophobic by contrast shibuya blue cave illumination at yoyogi park was underwhelming my two memorable dining experiences in the city were at a my melody collab cafe where a neighbouring table spent 45 minutes straight photographing their afternoon tea set and walking to sushizanmai after a long day out for some fresh highquality sushi past 200am i also recommend checking out a family restaurant at least once i mainly shopped around tky station character street shibuya and akihabara while many have soured on the latter it was my third time there and i still enjoyed hopping around the stores that said i wasnt hunting for bargains nor specific collectables collabocafecom is a useful resource for limitedtime cafes and popup shops note that the items listed on such sites may not be comprehensive i went to a couple shops that had a much wider selection in person than was advertised so prepare your wallet accordingly familymart seemed to carry the widest range of collaboration merchandise amongst the convenience store chains it can be worth trying a few stores as stock levels tend to be limited chichibu night festival the fifty two seats of happiness restaurant train typically runs a service ahead of the festival an intriguing albeit expensive transit option to pair with a stay in the area if you arent sticking around afterward i can vouch for reserved seats on the laview for the return trip to ikebukuro tickets opened on smooz on 3 november with the 10241147pm service selling out in under 30 minutes chichibu kyoto and takayama are home to the top three float festivals in japan the chichibu rendition is held over two days with information available on the festival site and qa we arrived in chichibu around 430pm on the second day but if youre primarily drawn by the floats and fireworks you likely dont need to be much earlier than 730pm naganos fireworks were far more technically impressive but chichibus floats and festival atmosphere made the overall experience feel a little grander an extensive series of stalls lined the streets all the way to chichibu shrine though they gave off more of a night market atmosphere and werent especially unique some paths and roads began to be barricaded off for crowd management as the evening progressed so it was confusing at times to get around the area there was a large gathering around the shrine where the floats begin their procession toward city hall but they head off one by one and you can catch a decent look at them along their journey theres an intersection where they approach from the west then change direction to the north and a railway crossing where they cross the parallel road to the north refer to the official guide from 2024 or this interactive map i pulled together the floats congregate outside city hall within a reserved section i believe the seats here are listed and sell out online and they require physical delivery the floats are not easily seen by the general public once they reach this point outside of peeking through or over fencing the tourism association set up a paid balcony area for fireworks viewing that partially overlooked the floats last year but you should probably save your money simply sit curbside nearby to enjoy the fireworks positioning yourself near city hall is convenient to board a train once the fireworks end around 955pm enoshima enoden trains were cute and reminded me of home the line was congested around lunchtime on a weekday awanouta is a short walk up a slope from shichirigahama station and serves an array of boutique ramen varieties i highly rate the tonkotsu bubble ramen and susurus ramen map as a resource the black iron sand of shichirigahama beach is much starker in real life i also stumbled upon the nowinfamous slam dunk crossing and while there was a crowd im far more sympathetic to concerns around it disturbing locals than the safety hazard framing in the press the escar and its luminous way arent really attractions in themselves note that the iwaya caves are still a reasonable distance to walk beyond the top escalator i found the caves to be unremarkable but you can catch an awesome sunset view of mt fuji on the west coast of the island when the skies are clear the garden illumination strictly switches on at 500pm despite sunset being closer to 430pm in early december with an additional payment is levied based on exit time its spectacular though there are limited spots where you can get a really good view of the garden as a whole odaiba we took a cruise on the futuristic emeraldas from asakusa to odaiba after checking that the weather was clear a few days in advance the top deck was opened 30 minutes in though we had passed the rainbow bridge by the time its illuminations began the small worlds museum is charming and features many more interactive elements than some contemporaries ive visited gallery b was rather small when i went so dont feel you have to rush through gallery a skipped odaiba i didnt get around to the game hall nor gundam statue coco ichibanya world i have fond memories of coco from past trips but didnt fit in a visit to this special store kamakura i was mulling the hkokuji bamboo forest and shnan monorail but i had a late night and opted to head straight to shichirigahama instead hokkaid 714 december tky niseko granclass on the tohokuhokkaid shinkansen was exceptional the full service included a light meal and beverage with pound cake on request the landscape out the window turned to white as we headed north i feel comfortable broadly recommending the train connection to sapporo given the smoothness of the transfer at shinhakodatehokuto however heading to niseko first is a harder sell at least until the full length of the hokkaid shinkansen is completed as it was we got off at oshamambe station and had a private transfer by car organised to avoid us squeezing onto an infrequent local train with lots of luggage oshamambe itself has nothing but a series of steep staircases between platforms and the entrance we threw in this last leg as we really wanted to experience the snow catching the end of shoulder season did grant us a cheaper and quieter stay overall but at the cost of attractions that fall later in winter like the sapporo snow festival niseko we were in niseko just to take it easy and take in the snow resort experience food options were understandably more limited and pricey but we enjoyed our meals at mli mlo french italian and afuri yuzu shio ramen expect some service hiccups as early december tends to be a training period ahead of peak season i was rather sceptical of tempura omakase going in and unfortunately tempura araki didnt convince me maybe i dont appreciate great tempura maybe the staff were thrown off by the girl group next to us that barely ate their food but i feel there are any number of dishes that stand to benefit more from an elevated experience the newlyopened ace gondola wasnt too busy during this period so we had our own capsule up and down we had also signed up for snowmobiling and it was almost fun except for the guided tour insisting on going painfully slow i got my days mixed up so we ended up at lupicia on one of its winter days off luckily there was still a gelato vending machine operating outside takahashi dairy farm is an entire complex to try and buy your way through beyond the pizza and salad we had at mandriano we walked away with cream puffs cheese tarts chocolate bars and lupicia beer hakko ginger was a hidden gem inspired byand in my opinion outdoingaustralian ginger beer lake tya we splurged on a ryokan while i knew of the meals i still wasnt prepared for 2 hourlong kaiseki dinner followed by a similarly massive breakfast spread the public openair onsen had an absolutely outrageous view overlooking the lake and was made all the more magical as snow fell in the early hours of the morning sapporo we kept a looser schedule to decompress at the end of our trip theres good food and no shortage of shops around sapporo regular shoes with some tread were fine to navigate snowy paths on the surface but i recommend exploring the expansive walkways underground to sidestep the slipperiness i especially appreciated the stretch between sapporo and susukino and its connections to neighbouring complexes we didnt pay for the tours around shiroi koibito park and i felt it was better off as a quick stop for souvenirs anyway we lost a lot more time to mega don quijote and department stores like daimaru and marui imai visit their lowerbasement levels for a huge variety of snacks and omiyage the munich christmas market at odori park was a good vibe amongst the illuminations but its ultimately a brief visit unless you stop to peruse each and every store the sapporo beer museum has tasting paddles and individual pours including of their kaitakushi brew a recreation of the original 1876 recipe dont miss the malted cheesecake while youre here we were rewarded for our long wait in queue for sushi toriton with the best sushi we had all trip the sheer variety and value were astounding even the various crab dishes were well priced with ramen alley teeming with diners we decided to check out new ramen street id skip it in favour of standouts you can find elsewhere across the city like the curry soup option at karai ramen 14 i was apprehensive of soup curry going in but its worlds apart from sb theres a proper exploration of spice and plenty of variation between stores the parfaits were extravagant but expect to queue to be seated in the evenings airports i didnt have much time in new chitose airport but the seafood rice bowl at shima no hito was an appropriate sendoff for the region i had a middling impression of narita internal airport in past but the experience felt markedly different with a daytime layover while theres not much of a view outside of the observation deck for plane spotting it was unexpectedly peaceful and pleasant to navigate around there were plentiful dining shopping optionsalbeit with generous markupsand i loved the lobster ramen at mugi to olive skipped mount usu the snowfall on the day wouldve obscured sightseeing around these parts noboribetsu we took a more direct driving route to sapporo especially given we had already been to hells valley in yamanouchi otaru we decided to take it easier around sapporo rather than squeeze in another day trip transport trains i found it relatively easy to reserve tickets online while hardly necessary for most services it was helpful for scenic trains that tend to book out and to reserve specific seats or carriages particularly for oversized baggage for services eg in hokkaid not available online just head to a jr station and allow for some time in case theres a queue at the ticket machines i still had to collect paper tickets from an e5489 booth but this allowed us to skip the queues at the regular ticket counters for shinkansen services that use smartex you can go a step further by associating your tickets with ic cards so you can simply walk up to the gate note that smartex didnt let me book services departing within the next few minutes so dont leave things to the last minute some stations eg kyto station are sprawling dont blindly trust google maps routing and leave enough of a buffer to find your way through to the appropriate platform you can often find detailed station layouts online if you need to strictly time a connection if you like trains scout for scenic services along your trip the joyful trains are particularly affordable options taxis i didnt use the taxi much but came away unimpressed by the go app outside of the biggest cities where a nearby vehicle is practically guaranteed its aggressive limits on calling drivers from further away meant we had to at times walk 10 minutes in the direction of a roaming taxi in order to be picked up which was nonsensical as mentioned earlier if youre not finding any go services in your current prefecture its worth checking if theres an alternative platform like didi available rental cars this may be an unpopular opinion but the 790km we travelled by road from takayama to nagano were far more scenic than the trains we took in the region the infrastructure through these parts is spectacular and i found a rental to be underrated for the convenience of storing your belongings and stashing purchases you pick up along the way and fitting more varied activities into a day without having to stress over timetables and transit connections popping in to roadside stations for local specialties and seasonal produce added to the charm of the countryside on highways the toyota satnav conveniently lists upcoming rest areas and stations so theres really no need to plan ahead i reserved all our rentals online given we were after oneway transfers that are subject to availability try to reserve an etc card along with the car or youll either have to avoid toll roads or carry some cash to pay at the toll gates i recommend opting for newer vehicle model years where possible for improved builtin satnav software but even still i found the fastest way to select destinations was to search the location on my phone where i could easily enter romaji or kana then roughly line up the spot on cars map i didnt have issues arriving earlier than the specified reservation timefor example the earliest i could book one jr rentacar was 1100am but we were served at 1015ambut you should expect to burn 30 minutes on paperwork and process before you can head off i mostly drove a minivan and didnt have any issues even through tighter oneway roads that said i hail from a righthand drive country and have driven overseas before so your mileage may vary i consistently pegged flow of local traffic at 2030 kmh above the speed limit i thought this may change with the icy roads of hokkaid but the same seemed to hold there luggage forwarding this trip was the first time we had used yamato transport it was as good as it sounds for us we left a full day buffer between the day we sent our luggage off and the day of receipt and our items were waiting for us in our accommodation at the end of our nagano kyoto and kyoto setoda connections our final hotel was willing to accept deliveries two weeks in advance so we also shipped some items that werent going to use during the trip from kyoto sapporo youll have a better time if your hotel handles the dispatch or you have a local contact who can help you out in nagano the closest konbini wouldnt take our luggage based on a 25kg weight limit per item even though we knew they were all comfortably under 20kg luckily our airbnb host helped us to the closest yamato center and with the paperwork you arent limited to hotels as shipping destinations we had luggage delivered to smaller boutique accommodation without issue as long as there are staff available to accept the luggage you can even specify the delivery timeframe to ensure it lines up with manned hours

    "ksp advancement im relatively new to this glorious game and have been playing for about 150 hours so far ive understand most of how the game works and at the very least understand the core mechanics however i play with mods and there are so many caveats i just dont get ive been diving deeper into ksp with a heavily modded setup lots of the big names like nerteas near future suite bdb community tech tree basically creating something similar ish to saber dynamics and im realizing just how much there is to actually learn about how all these parts and systems really work under the hood ive been playing a science mode play through and kinda figuring it out as i go along so far i can comfortably get to and from the mun and minmus i have also started trying to figure out base mechanics as well as space stations and satellites this is why im making this post the parts seem like a vast amount of doohickeys and whatsits and i really struggle with making sure im maximising my science creation as well as effectiveness of missions because i dont know the meta im not just talking about the basics of what does this part do but the more intricate stuff like understanding the exact mechanics efficiencies hidden interactions or how certain mods balance or complement each other for those of you whove spent a lot of time mastering these modded installs how did you learn all the fine details do you rely mostly on wikis forum deepdives youtube tutorials or just trial and error are there any resources spreadsheets or guides that really helped you get it basically i want to get beyond surfacelevel understanding and actually know why certain parts or systems behave the way they do the kind of insight you only seem to get after a few hundred hours or good conversations with other modded players would love to hear how others approach this side of the game and here is my modlist for anyone who cares 4kspexpanded 4kspexpanded 0218 advanced flybywire windows

    "my ten for the omnitrix okay i decided to choose ten aliens i would put in my omnitrix im sure its not the first time someone is doing this so these are the ten for my smart guy because every team needs one i was thinking about the obvious two greymatter and brainstorm i know there is also a devilish guy in omniverse but sadly i didnt watch omniverse so all these aliens will be from original ben10 and uaf both greymatter and brainstorm have shown their smarts in many occaisons i would say they are relative when it comes to brain capacity though what differs them is graymatters size which can be both good and bad thing as he is pretty much relative to a pudding when it comes to strenght but his size also makes him good for hiding and getting into enemies if they are robots or whatever so he can mess with them from inside brainstorm on the other hand is much bigger so if you need to hide and think for a moment it will be much harder for him to do so but his electrical abillities make him strong enough to stand his ground in most scenarios obviously when making your omnitrix you need a strong guy the main fighter and my contestants for this role are fourarms humongosaur and rath all three of them are pretty good options obviously all three are super strong and about the same size so whoever i choose i dont think i would make a bad choice rath has the best presonality he is the funniest but id say maybe the weakest out of the three of them while humongosaur is probably the strongest though he lacks the speed that fourarms has but id say that rath is much faster than both of them though he is the onlyone of the three that seems so change the way ben behaves making him much more agressive none of them seem like a bad choice even now when i know which one i would choose i could easily swich for any other rath is the fastest and most agressive humongosaur is the strongest and the biggest four arms is in the middle he has both speed and strength and two extra arms are defenetly something the third archetype you need would be a speedster and for this one i had no doubts who i would choose there are two speedsters i even took for an option xlr8 and jetray fast track never entered my mind sadly haha no hate for him but he had like two apeariances as far as i remember i watched ben10 some time ago when it comes to xlr8 and jetray i believe there is obvious winner one is much faster has two extra abilities and i believe no disadvatages over the other one i dont think there are more archetypes like strenght speed and brains so this guy i chose for his reliabilityness im not sure if that is an actual word the fourt guy is not best in any of the categories that i said up untill now but has something he can do that none can contestants for this part are diamondhead and his crystals he can be good for offence he could also be a main fighter i guess doesnt do that job 100 in my opinion but he is not bad either he can also use his abilities for attack and defence his durability is great he can shoot his diamonds for ranged attacks he can create constructs with it to trap enemies he can change the shapes of his arms and similar he can create diamond walls to shield and if they need a construct like a bridge or something he can definetly do it the other contestent is chromastone who is also a pretty good fighter i think he has like the best durability yet and his energy absorbtion is great he can absorb any energy attack ever and give it back so he is also super durable and can use long range attack much much stronger than diamondhead and is good for absorbing enemy attacks stink fly is also a contestant he can fly and im sure he is fast flyer at that his toxic abilities would be pretty usefull in many situations and his sticky spit can be used to trap enemies while also being able to scan terrain from the sky next guy i chose is meant for water i believe jetray is shown breathing underwater but the contestants for this role are waterhazard and ripjaws waterhazard is pretty strong he has water blasts and can breathe underwater what gives him upper hand is that he can also breathe outside water which makes him much more versetile but when it comes underwater i believe ripjaws get upperhand as downthere waterhazard can just breathe and ripjaws has his signature jaws to help him win in a fight also he takes more fishlike form so i guess he is faster in water im not sure about that it really comes down to do i want to be good in both water and on land or to be super strong in water but useless on land for a more supporting role and more of a utility there are several characters with uniqe powers i can choose from wildvine can plant stuff in the ground to help him fight also he can change the length of his body which is super dope goop can take any form realy and is pretty much indestructible as i can see all of the attacks just go through him though his ufo over the head is a big problem there is also upgrade who can get control and upgrade vehicles which is super usefull in many situations he can also change his body lodestar and his magnetic abilities can also be used in many situations he is onlyone who cant change shape of his body but he is not a fighter type he can stand back and help move stuff or sure he can also be used for long range attacks benmummy is one of my favorites he can freely move his bandages and with which he can trap his opponents and im sure he can use them for something else the seventh spot i also opted for a utility character but not a support rather just a guy who has something i can use more defensivly its hard to describe so i will just tell you the contestants and explain after ghostfreak and big chill the utility in question is someone who can phase through stuff which in my opinion is pretty good ability to have both of them have something going for them ghostfreak is my favorite alien from original ben10 he can phase through stuff and be invisible just like big chill but he can posses people which is super cool while big chill can phase through stuff and be invisible but he gets ice powers also he is my favorite from uaf both of them have much going for them now that i think about it it could go either way really next guy i chose for his ability to generate a big blast to be honest i think i dont have a ranged guy there are couple of guys on the list that can use long range attacks but none of them are chosen for that specifically so i decided to take someone who can not only shoot powerful beams but shoot powerfull beams options are nrg who contained can shoot superstrong beams but when he is not contained and he can find any form of enery around god forbids a nuclear plant then he becomes like the strongest alien after alien x realy but he has to actualy find it so for his full potention to be shown he has to be in such situation the next guy is heatblast who is much faster can fly and can generate his strongest attacks whenever and im sure there is a claim or a comic or something that he can generate blasts the power of a sun or something the third guy is chromastone who by himself cannot generate blastst tha can destroy cities but with enough energy stored and absorbed can can probably nuke a country at some point ninth and tenth spots are both chosen for x factor they arent chosen for their strength or speed for support or attack or defense they are both taken because they have a specific skill that will be needed at some point so i chose them there is already a spot for a strong guy but none of the characters i chose for strength are truly phisicaly strongest of bens alien there is one guy who is phisically much stronger than rath humongosaur and four arms combined but i chose one of them as my main fighter if im in the street and one of the highbreeds aproaches me to fight im transforming into rath or humongosaur or fourarms but if time needed if i get aproached by like both vilgax and agregor on a random field i aint taking no chances im turning straight into ultimate way big and stomping the shit out of them the last guy i choose is someone i never thought i would choose and just few days ago i saw something that made me apreciate the alien much more lets say i get attacked by highbreed and i dont feel like fighting or he is super strong i cant fight him with waybig cuz we are in a city or whatever the circumstances are i can just turn into uppchuck and eat the guy and just spit him on the street uppchuck can just eat anybody wtf i saw a clip where someone charged at ben and he just ate him so my list is 1 brainstorm 2 humongosaur 3 jetray 4 diamondhead 5 ripjaws 6 upgrade 7 bigchill 8 nrg 9 waybig 10 upchuck honorable mentions are benmummy chormastone amphibian and clockwork who i didnt choose because he is too op",
    "how to clean a remote control car after use hey everyone so ive been into rc cars for a while now and one thing i learned the hard way is that cleaning your remote control car after each bash session makes a huge difference in how long it lasts i used to just toss mine in the closet covered in dirt and mud and honestly that was a mistake the gears got all gunked up and some parts started rusting not fun heres what i do now and it takes like 10 minutes tops step 1 let it cool down after driving give your rc vehicle a few minutes to chill the motor and battery get pretty hot especially if youve been running it hard step 2 remove the battery always take out the battery pack first you dont want any electrical stuff getting wet during cleaning this is super important for both electric and brushless motor cars step 3 brush off the loose dirt i use an old toothbrush or a small paintbrush to get rid of mud grass and debris pay attention to the wheels suspension and chassis get into those tight spots around the steering components and shock absorbers step 4 wipe down with a damp cloth for the body shell and plastic parts a slightly damp microfiber cloth works great dont spray water directly on the electronics or receiver box if youve got a waterproof remote control car you have a bit more freedom here but i still avoid soaking the inside parts step 5 clean the tires the tires pick up tons of rocks and dirt i usually rinse them under the sink or wipe them down good clean tires grip better on your next run step 6 check for damage while cleaning i look for loose screws wornout parts or anything broken its way easier to spot problems when everythings clean step 7 dry everything let your car air dry completely before putting the battery back in or storing it i usually leave mine out for about 30 minutes step 8 light lubrication once its dry i put a tiny bit of oil on the drivetrain and moving parts this keeps everything running smooth and prevents rust if youre looking for a quality rc car thats worth taking care of ive found some solid options here theyve got different styles whether youre into offroad bashers or speed racing taking care of your rc hobby doesnt have to be complicated a little maintenance after each use means your remote controlled vehicle will last way longer and perform better plus its kind of satisfying to see it all clean and ready for the next adventure trust me your future self will thank you when your car is still running strong months later while your buddys is falling apart and if youre in the market for a new one or want to check out whats available definitely browse through the selection at whats your cleaning routine like any tips i missed",

    "wibtah if i left my husband while he is undergoing medical drama even though he is causing me financial and emotional distress first time redditor be gentle so little bit of background info i 32f luisa have been married to 48m john for approximately 25 years weve been together for 5 years i have a son carlos from a previous relationship 15m and we all live together in a rented souplex now the issue john has a mysterious medical issue that causes seizures passing out and even memory loss very rarely and it does come back eventually ive been helping him with it since it started 1 year ago every issue that started to take place prior to his health problems that also eventually led into his health frenzy started out small i didnt think much of it at the time and it continued to grow and become a much bigger problem on a much greater scale it began with the truck purchase i helped and supported my husband with a selfemployed business opportunity that he was highly interested in at the time getting it setup and running where the purchase of this vehicle was part of the process due to his low credit he had the finances for it we had to use my credit we settled on the verbal understandingagreement that we would keep the truck under my credit for a year giving him time to better his score and then refinance it in his name so i could remove my name from the vehicle moving forward leaving the dealership i was labeled as the owner and my husband as the coowner fast forward john started falling short with payments where i had to front the money so i dont get penalized as its under my namecredit missed payments lied about making payments which all led to me finding out about the vehicle being repossessed let me be clear that he never told me the truth about this matter i actually called the financial service company to inquire information that i wasnt getting from my husband about the trucks payments and thats when they informed me about the trucks repossession and being resold at an auction my husbands excuse the entire time i had asked previously where the truck was was that it was at the mechanics which at that time the truck did have some electrical issues so i believed it he had nothing to say when i confronted him on this matter and didnt offer to make it right just ridiculous excuses why this happened to try and repair the damage he caused i worked out a deal with the finance company that cut the price of what was still remaining and owed on the truck with the lowest monthly price for him to pay back each month on the due date of my husbands choosing all of this info was discussed carefully with him before i confirmed with the finance company he did alright with this at first and then this led to me having to stay on top of him each month and demand for these payments to be sent to me so i could ensure he is actually paying this he eventually stopped giving me payments and replied with excuses of not having enough money or why else he cant pay it let me add that my husband works two jobs and is a retired veteran he was medically retired who does receive a percentage of disability and retirement pay so he makes money and more than me consistently i will add that he does not receive the full 100 amount but close to it the next event that he affected was the rent on our previous apartment and our current house that we are renting we lived at our apartment complex that was in my name my mother was the cosigner because my credit got us the place but we had to use my income my husbands income and my moms in order to show that we could financially qualify for the place the sole purpose of my mom cosigning for us was to meet the complexs must show that you make 3x the rent requirement as the monthly rent would solely be taken care of with with my husbands va pay and our income we lived there for 4 years and towards the last yearyear and a half i got some rude surprises and learned that my husband didnt pay rent and almost got us evicted not once not twice but almost three times he was never the one who communicated further about this matter and i had to find out the hard way getting noticesknocks on my door before all this happened let me note that i had given him endless support with help advice and tons of resources throughout this entire process of each event before they ended with negative consequences and results in the end during our last year at the apartment we moved out of there back in mid may of 2025 and into our current house that we are renting we had worked out a payment plan between each other to move out of our apartment two months early before out lease ended we had to do this as the landlord to the rental house would only gives us an additional two week period to move in and we didnt want to be stuck without a new place to go when our lease ended it took me months and months to find that house we moved into he wasnt able to work with our two month moveout time frame and it made more sense for us to go about our situation this way as we would have paid more to break our lease early and not have the funds available for the new rental house a plan was in place to balance both places for the next two months i checked in multiple times with him to reconfirm that everything was on schedule as planned and he ensured he was continuing to make the payments as per the plan fast forward i get letters in the mail stating that we needed to evacuate the premises by a very small almost impossible deadline thank goodness we already had everything moved out and into the new place and that close to four grand was owed to the complex confronting my husband about this matter he declared he had paid been paying and would look into why i was receiving these letters time passed no word from him about this matter more time passes he provides no real answer to me regarding this issue having to take things into my own hands again i eventually get records of his transaction history and i come to learn the heart sinking truth that he did not pay rent like we had planned during the last few months there since finding this out this info has been sent to the credit bureaus and now impacts my ability to be accepted into any new rentals until its fully paid back once again another impact on my credit reputation that i am being penalized for due to his negligence currently my husband is not paying a cent back towards the apartments owed rent and lacks to come up with the difference of 440 that goes towards our current rent that his va checks do not cover every month he doesnt care that by law and by a binding contract he legally owes our landlord this money and simply doesnt pay it until i have to force it out of him he claims he never has the money despite having an entire month to come up with that amount so the ultimate question is where does it all go i cant seem to figure it out and i most definitely do not trust the man anymore in between all of this several instances of situations where we had agreed to split costs on important matters medical pets holidays he initially kept true to his word but quickly each time petered off and left me footing the remaining bills which has left me in a substantial amount of financial debt recently i had to use his phone for a legitimate reason and while i had it something a divine message perhaps told me to check his messages and i learned that he has been communicating romantically with a younger woman i was not able to keep his phone for much longer at that time so i was not able to see how far back this went andor if there are others but between inappropriate pics and the romantic language communicated he has been committing at least emotional infidelity the man who once told me he was not a liar faithful and loyal has become the most disgusting and dishonest man i have ever met he usually plays the victim in every scenario all of these things have led me to decide that i need to leave him for my financial security my mental security and the financial security of my sons future where do i begin the process of leaving him how can i leave him when his medical issues make me appear like the bad guy and how do i manage to get him to pay the money he owes to me and others to get my credit back on track wibtah if i left him when he needs me also a side note if this is deemed not appropriate for this subreddit could someone direct me to the correct community again this is my first time posting and im unsure of the rules or niche areas my sister skye 33f will be helping me monitor this post note from skye this puts the literal tropical storm on your wedding day into perspective and it now makes sense why i know next to nothing about him after 5 years it also makes me suspect that the scam where you lost money on the moving company debacle and even that time the emergency money went missing from your sock drawer were possibly not accidents sorry youre going through it little sis small update just before posting this just found out he pawned his wedding band",
    "was i overcharged service on 2003 jeep tj wrangler in vancouver bc im based in vancouver bc the vehicle in question is a 2003 jeep tj wrangler automatic 163km paid 236 for a mobile come out to check my jeep which had been sitting in my garage for over a year it had previous issues with parasitic draw i told him this i just wanted it fixed and serviced and ready to go he made a bunch of guarantees and told me it would all be done for 1900 fine i paid 170 to tow it to his shop then costs eventually ballooned to 2200 for extra parts and repairs he forgot to include then one day he called out of the blue and said that all 4 tires needed to be replaced for 1700 which was not mentioned at the diagnostic i declined and took the vehicle back when he was done with it lo and behold 2 days later it wouldnt start he quoted me another 1400 to investigate the parasitic drain said automotive electrical work was 250hour but hed cut me a deal for 200hour and it would take 7 hours after my partner informed him that it was unacceptable that he took our money to service everything but didnt address the primary issue he ghosted us all in im nearly 3000 out and i dont have a functioning car my question is ive since spoken to other mechanics and gotten different quotes and am coming to the conclusion that he was far overcharging me for the services rendered as well other mechanics are also quoting 160hour for automotive electrical investigation ive screenshotted the original invoice below did i get taken for a ride",
    "99 ford ranger died middrive pump relay and engine clicking im completely new to diy auto care so what did i do i bought a 99 ford ranger and said i know things will break eventually itll be a good chance to learn well its been a week since i bought it and here we are my education begins sooner than i thought tldr truck stalleddied while driving was able to start up again and drive another 500 feet before it died again since then havent been able to start itll turn over but rev up and then die again when in the on position check engine light flickers in sync with the ticking sound in the video check gauges light is on steady battery light is on steady theft light is flashing quickly i dont believe this truck has the security system that requires a certain key to turn on but a code did come back with p1260 engine disabled by pats the key i have looks totally normal and i have a keyfob that locksunlocks doors the clicking in the video is coming from the fuel pump relay most noticeably and another quieter clicking somewhere down in the back middle or lower part of the engine bay as well i can hear it down by the fuel tank fuel pump as well but im assuming thats just from reverberation because its quieter i dont know how much detail i should provide so im going to provide it all in hopes it helps an expert help me vehicle details 1999 ford ranger xlt 40l v6 4x4143k miles im the 3rd owner previous owner had a few vehicles and didnt drive it as a daily driving historyinitial indicators test drive went great no issues took it to a mechanic for a presale inspection and he said it was in good shape outside of a valve cover leak and front cover crank seal leak theres definitely an oil leak with a mix of old and new oil covering the bottom half of the engine but when parked in the driveway overnight after driving for a while there were two drips about the size of a dime drove daily for a week i noticed a few days after purchasing that it would take a few seconds to turn over when i first started it up rer rer rer rer then it drove fine and started up fine the rest of the day five days ago i try to start it i had driven it an hour prior and it turns over but then cycles high rpm then low rpm then high rpm then low rpm and then stalls the lights in the video come on i think not ideal but i try again same thing try one more time and it turns over and runs fine i probably shouldve dealt with it then but ive been exceptionally busy so i figured very light use for a week or two would be fine given that was the only time that happened then three days ago im driving about a 15 minute drive and it dies middrive i try to start again and its struggling try a couple more times and it starts up and im able to get it out of the middle of the intersection to the side of the road before it dies again power steering brakes etc i had it towed back to my place where ive been doing my best to figure it out but im a bit overwhelmed more complicated diagnosis than i was hoping for my first diy attempt heres what ive investigated used a circuit tester all circuits are working fine both under the hood and by the drivers side door i visually inspected a handful as well no issues ran an obd ii diagnostic with the key in on position using forscan obviously cant scan with the engine running it came back with a number of codes but im unsure which of these are actually active and which are historic and were never cleared the guy i bought it from mentioned hed fixed a couple of things so its possible he never cleared codes hes a 50 year auto parts salesman which makes me feel both good and also slightly scared was he a knowledgeable parts guy or a just weld the hitch to the bumper guy he seemed very nice and trustworthy and im generally a good judge of character but maybe i missed this one hoping not here are the codes that came back pcm p0171 p0174 pcm 1000 gem p1808 gem p1804 gem b1483 gem p0500 gem b1359 abs c1230 abs c1102 im praying some of these are historic and have been fixed given none of the breakers popped in the power distribution box it seems odd all of these circuits would malfunction at once without impacting a single fuse or maybe thats naive my level of knowledge is based on about 1000 google searches and youtube videos built on a foundation of generally being handy around the house and not being a moron i also tested the battery charge was fine when it died tow guy checked it and it was right on the money around 12v when he arrived im assuming that means it wasnt an alternator overcharging things edit to add serpentine belt is fine as well no gauges indicated issues before it died middrive no check engine lights came on just died and now this looked at the air filter looks almost brand new checked the connection to the maf and a few other sensors and they all look fine checked all the fluid levels and condition shortly after getting it and everything looked fine brake fluid was a little dark but not alarming so what would you do next i have a running list of guesses from my internet searching and youtube vids but im kind of paralyzed by what the next best step is going to be some of the guesses for the stall start rev stall fuel mix code lead me to bad fuel pump clogged fuel filter vacuum seal issue bad maf sensor but the ticking fuel pump relay and ticking in the engine bay area the sensor failure codes are making me worry about electrical issues id really like to figure this out myself if i can both to save money and also to have some pride in being able to fix something like this and take the opportunity to learn thanks in advance happy to send any other photos or videos that would be helpful i can try to start the engine again for an example i didnt include that here because im generally trying to avoid doing that too much because i have no idea if itll make things worse",

either because you are ready for something new or have a jobcareer that gives you that freedom as a person that values quality time and experiences together long distance is going to be a challenge but ive done a lot of work and put a lot of thought into it and im ready to put in the work and energy want more to know more ive spent a small fortune in therapy im not fixed probably never will be but i am equipped with lots of tools to work through things ive know i wanted to be child free since high school but i was also intelligent and open minded enough to know that my views may change with age they didnt fought through my mid 20s and into my early 30s to get a vasectomy so about me im good with my hands and have always been curious how things work so for as far back as i can remember ive taken things apart and put them back together i also liked science and have been fascinated by electricity somehow this landed me a job in fleet maintenance for my local county i primarily build and repair emergency response vehicles lights sirens fabricating things that you cant buy for our specialty needs thats what i do im also a car guy i spent my teens and 20s playing with classic muscle cars primarily with my cousins and a small group of friends its become a lot less of a priority as most of them have familys and more responsibilities in their lives now i still routinely meet up with a couple of them a couple of times a month i learned something in my 30s that may be vary obvious to others but it was quite life changing for me you dont have to be good at something to enjoy it this has changed my prospective on life quite a bit and it may seem simple to others but for me its wasnt i have given it much thought as to why it was so hard for me to come to this realization and we can discuss that when we chat regardless it has shaped the current version of myself and im quite happy with the results heres the current me experiences and time have gotten a lot more valuable to me id rather get an extra week of vacation than a raise at this point we can always trade our time for more but its difficult to trade for more time so what do i do with my time i guess i go outside and play from riding quads in the sand dunes to motorcycles with friends to having a picnic on the beach to hiking to a view point to watch the sunset im in i like it i do it what ive really been into lately is mountain biking its great exercise it provides excitement and it gives me a reason to explore new places i rode about 14 of the way around mt saint helens this summer my second big passion is seeing nature and all the public lands we have available to us for the last couple of years ive taken an extended road trip in the fall where ill hike and bike until i cant see straight i bought a van a couple years ago its nothing amazing but it serves as a good home base i set it up with lots of storage a battery system and a diesel heater so i can go out on the shoulder season and still have a good time ill tent if i have to but the van just makes it so much easier i didnt do a big road trip this year because i decided to take a bunch of long weekends and explored a little closer to home theres so much to see if you stop and look im game to stop and jump in a mountain lake stay up late and photograph the stars when its clear ill drive and explore all the dirt roads i can find im slowly visiting all the national parks but im always down to revisit any you havent been to my third would probably be photography mostly landscape and nature i love trying to find new waterfalls to photograph ive also been dabbling in astronomy photography and recently purchased a book on native wildlife here in the pnw here in a couple weekends im heading out to one of the san juan island to try and see some foxes ok that was a lot maybe you are worried you arent experienced in a lot of the stuff i mentionedbut you are interested thats awesome the thing is the drive to experience and try

others im an introvert im not shy its just that large busy groupsevents drain my energy im really good at knowing where im at and communicating it to my partner but if you like going to lots of

something i seek out i know there are some that literally travel just to try new places to eat if thats you im probably not your guy i grew up with and up until a couple years ago ive always had pets i love cats and dogs and i dearly miss my girl onyx but the fact that im gone from home for almost 12hrs a day for work and so many of the places i travel arent always pet friendly it just doesnt seem like something i need or want to put a pet though that doesnt mean that you having a pet is a deal breaker i would never expect someone to ever give up a pet for me you are their entire life in fact id spoil them so hard maybe you are on the same path but still have some time left with your current companion i just want to be clear that i at some point would prefer to be pet free a couple cats or

    "an electric vehicle ev is a motor vehicle whose propulsion is powered fully or mostly by electricity evs encompass a wide range of transportation modes including road and rail vehicles electric boats and submersibles electric aircraft and electric spacecraft early electric vehicles first came into existence in the late 19th century when the second industrial revolution brought forth electrification and mass utilization of dc and ac electric motors using electricity was among the preferred methods for motor vehicle propulsion as it provided a level of quietness comfort and ease of operation that could not be achieved by the gasoline engine cars of the time but range anxiety due to the limited energy storage offered by contemporary battery technologies hindered any mass adoption of private electric vehicles throughout the 20th century internal combustion engines both gasoline and diesel engines were the dominant propulsion mechanisms for cars and trucks for about 100 years but electricitypowered locomotion remained commonplace in other vehicle types such as overhead linepowered mass transit vehicles like electric trains trams monorails and trolley buses as well as various small lowspeed shortrange batterypowered personal vehicles such as mobility scooters plugin hybrid electric vehicles use electric motors as the primary propulsion method rather than as a supplement and did not see any mass production until the late 2000s and battery electric cars did not become practical options for the consumer market until the 2010s progress in batteries electric motors and power electronics has made electric cars more feasible than during the 20th century as a means of reducing tailpipe emissions of carbon dioxide and other pollutants and to reduce the use of fossil fuels government incentives are available in many areas to promote the adoption of electric cars history electric motive power started in 1827 when hungarian priest nyos jedlik built the first rudimentary yet functional electric motor the next year he used it to power a small model car in 1835 professor sibrandus stratingh of the university of groningen in the netherlands built a miniature electric vehicle car and sometime between 1832 and 1839 robert anderson of scotland invented the first crude electric carriage powered by nonrechargeable primary cells american blacksmith and inventor thomas davenport built a toy electric locomotive powered by a primitive electric motor in 1835 in 1838 a scotsman named robert davidson built an electric locomotive that attained a speed of four miles per hour 6 kmh in england a patent was granted in 1840 for the use of rails as conductors of electric current and similar american patents were issued to lilley and colten in 1847 the first massproduced electric vehicles appeared in america in the early 1900s in 1902 the studebaker automobile company entered the automotive business with electric vehicles though it also entered the gasoline vehicles market in 1904 however with the advent of cheap assembly line cars by ford motor company the popularity of electric cars declined significantly due to a lack of electricity grids and the limitations of storage batteries at that time electric cars did not gain much popularity however electric trains gained immense popularity due to their economies and achievable speeds by the 20th century electric rail transport became commonplace due to advances in the development of electric locomotives over time the generalpurpose commercial use of electric cars was reduced to specialist roles as platform trucks forklift trucks ambulances tow tractors and urban delivery vehicles such as the iconic british milk float for most of the 20th century the uk was the worlds largest user of electric road vehicles electrified trains were used for coal transport as the motors did not use the valuable oxygen in the mines switzerlands lack of natural fossil resources forced the rapid electrification of their rail network one of the earliest rechargeable batteries the nickeliron battery was favored by edison for use in electric cars evs were among the earliest automobiles and before the preeminence of light powerful internal combustion engines ices electric automobiles held many vehicle land speed and distance records in the early 1900s they were produced by baker electric columbia electric detroit electric and others and at one point in history outsold gasolinepowered vehicles in 1900 28 percent of the cars on the road in the us were electric evs were so popular that even president woodrow wilson and his secret service agents toured washington dc in their milburn electrics which covered 6070 miles 100110 km per charge most producers of passenger cars opted for gasoline cars in the first decade of the 20th century but electric trucks were an established niche well into the 1920s several developments contributed to a decline in the popularity of electric cars improved road infrastructure required a greater range than that offered by electric cars and the discovery of large reserves of petroleum in texas oklahoma and california led to the wide availability of affordable gasolinepetrol making internal combustion powered cars cheaper to operate over long distances electric vehicles were seldom marketed as womens luxury car which may have been a stigma among male consumers also internal combustionpowered cars became evereasier to operate thanks to the invention of the electric starter by charles kettering in 1912 which eliminated the need of a hand crank for starting a gasoline engine and the noise emitted by ice cars became more bearable thanks to the use of the muffler which hiram percy maxim had invented in 1897 as roads were improved outside urban areas the electric vehicle range could not compete with the ice finally the initiation of mass production of gasolinepowered vehicles by henry ford in 1913 significantly reduced the cost of gasoline cars as compared to electric cars in the 1930s national city lines which was a partnership of general motors firestone and standard oil of california purchased many electric tram networks across the country to dismantle them and replace them with gm buses the partnership was convicted of conspiring to monopolize the sale of equipment and supplies to their subsidiary companies still it was acquitted of conspiring to monopolize the provision of transportation services the copenhagen summit conducted amid a severe observable climate change brought on by humanmade greenhouse gas emissions was held in 2009 during the summit more than 70 countries developed plans to reach net zero eventually for many countries adopting more evs will help reduce the use of gasoline in recent

mandated majorautomaker sales of evs in phases starting in 1998 from 1996 to 1998 gm produced 1117 ev1s 800 of which were made available through threeyear leases chrysler ford gm honda and toyota also produced limited numbers of evs for california drivers during this period in 2003 upon the expiration of gms ev1 leases gm discontinued them the discontinuation has variously been attributed to the auto industrys successful federal court challenge to californias zeroemissions vehicle mandate a federal regulation requiring gm to produce and maintain spare parts for the few thousand ev1s and the success of the oil and auto industries media campaign to reduce public acceptance of evs a movie made on the subject in 20052006 was titled who killed the electric car and released theatrically by sony pictures classics in 2006 the film explores the roles of automobile manufacturers oil industry the us government batteries hydrogen vehicles and the general public and each of their roles in limiting the deployment and adoption of this technology ford released a number of their ford ecostar delivery vans into the market honda nissan and toyota also repossessed and crushed most of their evs which like the gm ev1s had been available only by closedend lease after public protests toyota sold 200 of its rav4 evs they later sold at over their original fortythousanddollar price later bmw of canada sold off a number of mini evs when their canadian testing ended the production of the citron berlingo electrique stopped in september 2005 zenn started production in 2006 but ended by 2009 reintroduction during the late 20th and early 21st century the environmental impact of the petroleumbased transportation infrastructure along with the fear of peak oil led to renewed interest in electric transportation infrastructure evs differ from fossil fuelpowered vehicles in that the electricity they consume can be generated from a wide range of sources including fossil fuels nuclear power and renewables such as solar power and wind power or any combination of those recent advancements in battery technology and charging infrastructure have addressed many of the earlier barriers to ev adoption making electric vehicles a more viable option for a wider range of consumers the carbon footprint and other emissions of electric vehicles vary depending on the fuel and technology used for electricity generation the electricity may be stored in the vehicle using a battery flywheel or supercapacitors vehicles using internal combustion engines usually only derive their energy from a single or a few sources usually nonrenewable fossil fuels a key advantage of electric vehicles is regenerative braking which recovers kinetic energy typically lost during friction braking as heat as electricity restored to the onboard battery according to the international energy agencys global ev outlook 2024 more than 14 million new electric cars were sold worldwide in 2023 representing around 18 of total car sales for the year electricity sources evs are much more efficient than fossil fuel vehicles and have few direct emissions at the same time they do rely on electrical energy that is generally provided by a combination of nonfossil fuel plants and fossil fuel plants there are many ways to generate electricity of varying costs efficiency and ecological desirability evs can be made less polluting overall by modifying the source of electricity in some areas persons can ask utilities to provide their electricity from renewable energy therefore it gives the greatest degree of energy resilience connection to generator plants direct connection to electric grids as is common among electric trains trams trolleybuses and trolleytrucks see also overhead lines third rail and conduit current collection online electric vehicle collects power from electric power strips buried under the road surface through electromagnetic induction onboard generators and hybrid evs generated onboard using a diesel engine dieselelectric locomotive and dieselelectric multiple unit demu generated onboard using a fuel cell fuel cell vehicle generated onboard using nuclear energy nuclear submarines and aircraft carriers renewable sources such as solar power solar vehicle it is also possible to have hybrid evs that derive electricity from multiple sources such as onboard rechargeable electricity storage system ress and a direct continuous connection to landbased generation plants for purposes of onhighway recharging with unrestricted highway range onboard rechargeable electricity storage system and a fueled propulsion power source internal combustion engine plugin hybrid for especially large evs such as submarines the chemical energy of the dieselelectric can be replaced by a nuclear reactor the nuclear reactor usually provides heat which drives a steam turbine which drives a generator which is then fed to the propulsion see nuclear marine propulsion a few experimental vehicles such as some cars and a handful of aircraft use solar panels for electricity onboard storage these systems are powered from an external generator plant nearly always when stationary and then disconnected before motion occurs and the electricity is stored in the vehicle until needed full electric vehicles fev power storage methods include chemical energy stored on the vehicle in onboard batteries battery electric vehicle bev typically with a lithiumion battery kinetic energy storage flywheels static energy stored on the vehicle in onboard electric doublelayer capacitors batteries electric doublelayer capacitors and flywheel energy storage are forms of rechargeable onboard electricity storage systems by avoiding an intermediate mechanical step the energy conversion efficiency can be improved compared to hybrids by avoiding unnecessary energy conversions furthermore electrochemical batteries conversions are reversible allowing electrical energy to be stored in chemical form components the type of battery the type of traction motor and the motor controller design vary according to the size power and proposed application which can be as small as a motorized shopping cart or wheelchair through pedelecs electric motorcycles and scooters neighborhood electric vehicles industrial forklift trucks and including many hybrid vehicles battery an electricvehicle battery evb in addition to the traction battery specialty systems used for industrial or recreational vehicles are batteries used to power the propulsion system of a battery electric vehicle bevs these batteries are usually a secondary rechargeable battery and are typically lithiumion batteries traction batteries specifically designed with a high amperehour capacity are used in forklifts electric golf carts riding floor scrubbers electric motorcycles electric cars trucks vans and other electric vehicles lithiumion battery since their first commercial release in 1991 lithiumion batteries have become an important technology for achieving lowcarbon transportation systems most electric vehicles use lithiumion batteries liions or libs lithiumion batteries have a higher energy density longer life span and higher power density than most other practical batteries complicating factors include safety durability thermal breakdown environmental impact and cost liion batteries should be used within safe temperature and voltage ranges to operate safely and efficiently increasing the batterys lifespan decreases effective costs and environmental impact one technique is to operate a subset of the battery cells at a time and switching these subsets in the past nickelmetal hydride batteries were used in some electric cars such as those made by general motors these battery types are considered outdated due to their tendencies to selfdischarge in the heat furthermore a patent for this type of battery was held by chevron which created a problem for their widespread development these factors coupled with their high cost has led to lithiumion batteries leading as the predominant battery for evs the prices of lithiumion batteries have declined dramatically over the past decade contributing to a reduction in price for electric vehicles but an increase in the price of critical minerals such as lithium from 2021 to the end of 2022 has put pressure on historical battery price decreases electric motor the power of a vehicles electric motor as in other machines is measured in kilowatts kw electric motors can deliver their maximum torque over a wide rpm range this means that the performance of a vehicle with a 100 kw electric motor exceeds that of a vehicle with a 100 kw internal combustion engine which can only deliver its maximum torque within a limited range of engine speed efficiency of charging varies considerably depending on the type of charger and energy is lost during the process of converting the electrical energy to mechanical energy usually direct current dc electricity is fed into a dcac inverter where it is converted to alternating current ac electricity and this ac electricity is connected to a 3phase ac motor for electric trains forklift trucks and some electric cars dc motors are often used in some cases universal motors are used and then ac or dc may be employed in recent production vehicles various motor types have been implemented for instance induction motors within tesla motor vehicles and permanent magnet machines in the nissan leaf and chevrolet bolt energy and motors electric motors are mechanically very simple and often achieve 90 energy conversion efficiency over the full range of speeds and power output and can be precisely controlled motion is provided by a rotary electric motor however it is possible to unroll the motor to drive directly against a special matched track these linear motors are used in maglev trains which float above the rails supported by magnetic levitation this allows for almost no rolling resistance of the vehicle and no mechanical wear and tear of the train or track in addition to the highperformance control systems needed switching and curving of the tracks becomes difficult with linear motors which to date has restricted their operations to highspeed point to point services electric traction allows the use of regenerative braking in which the motors are used as brakes and become generators that transform the motion of usually a train into electrical power that is then fed back into the lines this system is particularly advantageous in mountainous operations as descending vehicles can produce a large portion of the power required for those ascending and in startandstop city use this regenerative system is only viable if the system is large enough to use the power generated by descending vehicles they can be finely controlled and provide high torque from stationarytomoving unlike internal combustion engines and do not need multiple gears to match power curves this removes the need for gearboxes and torque converters evs provide quiet and smooth operation and consequently have less noise and vibration than internal combustion engines while this is a desirable attribute it has also evoked concern that the absence of the usual sounds of an approaching vehicle poses a danger to blind elderly and very young pedestrians to mitigate this situation many countries mandate warning sounds when evs are moving slowly up to a speed when normal motion and rotation road suspension electric motor etc noises become audible electric motors do not require oxygen unlike internal combustion engines this is useful for submarines and for space rovers vehicle types it is generally possible to equip any kind of vehicle with an electric powertrain ground vehicles pureelectric vehicles a pureelectric vehicle or allelectric vehicle is powered exclusively through electric motors the electricity may come from a battery battery electric vehicle solar panel solar vehicle or fuel cell fuel cell vehicle hybrid evs there are different ways that a hybrid electric vehicle can combine the power from an electric motor and the internal combustion engine the most common type is a parallel hybrid that connects the engine and the electric motor to the wheels through mechanical coupling in this scenario the electric motor and the engine can drive the wheels directly series hybrids only use the electric motor to drive the wheels and",
