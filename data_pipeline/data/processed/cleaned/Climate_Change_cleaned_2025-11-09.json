    "the life and times of octavia e butler 2025 in these times link the life and times of octavia e butler in a new biography susana m morris reflects on the devolution of american empire through the lens of butlers life by aina marzia 20251009 art by rachel k dooleyphotos by malcolm aliwire image leo alexander the summer before susana m morris turned 16 an age when she wasnt quite grown but not a kid anymore either she read octavia butlers 1993 novel parable of the sower first encountering the black teenage girl at its center as an adult reckoning with americas political climate morris describes trumps encouragement of violence against journalists and detractors as something right out of the 1998 sequel parable of the talents now a scholar of black feminism at georgia tech morris has taught the novel countless times noting that nearly every student reacts with the same question how did octavia know new admirers of butlers work might otherwise struggle to imagine the butler who faced rejection letters and once pawned her typewriter to pay bills before catching her big break years later in morris new biography positive obsession the life and times of octavia e butler she tries to answer that question tracing butlers life from the young introvert sometimes described as a kind of misanthrope who preferred her own company to her posthumous legacy as a literary mastermind whose oeuvre has become a centerpiece of black liberation for morris the biography also works as a dedication to blackness and an opportunity to understand her own existence as a black queer woman in the united states we learn about butlers writing from childhood in postwar pasadena calif through the black power movement and the reagan administration and into her last moments at age 58 in 2006 shadowed by the iraq war and war on terror butlers early awareness of power structures shifted her mindset into one that wondered whether those who didnt have much power could empower themselves and others and change the world morris describes how many adults attempted to discourage a young butler from pursuing a writing career and how she became known as a news junkie as early as age 13 fed by the 1960 election of president john f kennedy details from butlers upbringing manifest throughout her frequently dystopian work which routinely envisioned futures with black women at the center changing the course of human life and culture a 1951 fire that burned her grandmothers house is a mirror to the drug addicted pyros who enjoy lighting and watching fires that consume neighborhoods in parable of the sower in kindred a slave narrative that incorporates time travel butler hints at her mothers upbringing on a southern plantation asking us to reassess the legacy of american slavery wild seed an unapologetically weird novel and the fourth in the patternist series asks what it means to be human while kindred and her other novels speak to a mother and feminine black existence one that could hold the fate of humanity within it in the pantheon of literary icons positive obsession places butler alongside a museum of literary icons including audre lorde toni morrison and alice walker writers who like butler took on patriarchy white supremacy and other structures of power in dynamic ways that centered black womens experiences and intellectual contributions the title comes from an article butler wrote for essence in 1989 i was writing science fiction and fantasy for gods sake at that time nearly all professional science fiction writers were white men as much as i loved science fiction and fantasy what was i doing well whatever it was i couldnt stop positive obsession is about not being able to stop just because youre afraid and full of doubts positive obsession is dangerous its about not being able to stop at all whats special about the book is how closely it sits with butler in the throes of her obsession as she clanks away at her remington typewriter during time snatched from jobs in factories and laundries in the 1971 short story crossover she writes about a woman who is brought to the brink of insanity as she works in a factory new admirers of butlers work might otherwise struggle to imagine the butler who faced rejection letters and once pawned her typewriter to pay bills before catching her big break years later as an introvert and avid reader butlers young mind became a dreamscape other inspirations include for example her local library and grocerystore science fiction magazines we learn the telepathic humans from the patternist series for example were influenced by zenna hendersons 1961 novel pilgrimage which featured similar strong women characters and an alien telepathic force that spoke up about their unique struggles we also get notes from butlers journals and diaries which butler sometimes wrote in spanish or code to speak freely they frequently share butlers early interest in utopian societies as she wondered whether socialist or communist models could come to fruition as people will not live together without taking advantage of each other if they possibly can they will not stop considering themselves better because their skin is light the same journals reveal how butler was known by estelle her middle name in childhood since she and her mother share the name octavia and how she grappled with the weight of poverty isolation and frustration early in her career morris shows how butlers early financial struggles led her to publish the book survivor despite being a commentary on settler colonialism butler reveals that she regretted hastily accepting editors changes and publishing something that felt to her like bad writing positive obsession eloquently tells the story of octavia the trailblazer who simply wanted to write the kinds of work she wanted to read and for morris it works as an opportunity to reconnect with that young teenager first encountering a black girl hero in a book",

    "prophecy from 2016 eerily correct this popped up as a facebook memory from 2016 a text that sarcasticallysatirically described the fictional day in 2029 when president trump passed away its jarring for me to see how many of this can already be the speed with which it all happened as well and by then people thought he would be a single term fluke you risked our future for that dad yesterday on june 12th 2029 president donald trump two days short of his 83rd birthday died peacefully in the white house just five months after winning a fourth term vice president sarah palin was immediately sworn in as his successor the announcement has shaken the country to its core provoking a quiet period of contemplation about the trump years and what comes next america has changed in ways that few believed possible when he was first elected in 2016 trump offered what many americans wanted he projected himself as a strong man who would turn back the clock and restore the country to what he thought was the greatness of the past in the 1950s and 1960s workingclass men in particular overwhelmingly supported trumps perplexing promise to return their manufacturing jobs and their middleclass lives as though they faced no new competition from women minorities and other countries those who understood the dangers to democracy that a man like trump represented had assumed that our system of checks and balances would keep him from going too far but they were wrong once in power trump accumulated more power with each passing year relying in part on a fiercely partisan congress and a compliant supreme court which included the three new members hed appointed those who disagreed with him including the press were slowly silenced by lawsuits threats personal attacks and imprisonment trump came to power in one of the nations most bizarre presidential elections it featured two widely unpopular major party candidates and two smaller party candidates hillary clinton trumps main competitor was widely expected to win the election according to polls and pundits across the spectrum trump however shocked the political world winning with just 46 percent of the vote after voters either ignored the polls or thought their vote didnt matter once inaugurated trump quickly acted on the promises hed made during the campaign many of which were laid out in his first 100 days plan over time all taxes on the rich and corporations were eliminated while spending on the military was increased by a third the national debt exploded trade deals were torn up but instead of creating new manufacturing jobs it caused the loss of 5 million jobs dependent upon exports the cost of imported goods doubled and tripled with new tariffs and trade wars hundreds of walmarts and bargain stores were forced to close abortion was outlawed samesex marriage was criminalized coal mining and offshore drilling were dramatically increased while all support for renewable energy was halted to reduce burdensome regulations the clean air act and the clean water act were gutted and in just a few years americans once again saw smog clouds over its cities acid rain in places like maine and rising pollution in its rivers and shorelines all actions to respond to climate change were stopped nearly all gun laws were eliminated including the ban on militarystyle heavy and tactical weapons millions of children of illegal immigrants were sent back to the country of their parents origin even though they were born here many died trying to return while the nations food industry nearly collapsed from the lack of harvesters food prices skyrocketed immigration was sharply curtailed except for white european christians muslims were excluded altogether in an aging country many companies were forced to close because of a lack of employees nuclear weapons spread to 12 new countries including at least four in danger of being overtaken by extremists who have pledged to use those weapons to eliminate americas major cities reckless taunting and overreactions have engaged the country in five new wars since 2020 as trump promised the world fears america but most of that fear is felt by our former allies who increasingly see the us as an erratic unreliable and dangerous superpower the country is now deeply settled in a second great depression leading to more calls for a dictatorship the children of america have begun to ask some hard questions of their parents at kitchen tables across the country what did you do to stop the rise of trump they ask parents often deny voting for trump others offer sheepish explanations i never thought he would win all the polls had clinton winning i thought i was free to use my vote as a protest against the system but dad didnt you hear what trump was saying didnt you know that there was only one candidate who could have stopped him why didnt you vote for her dad im sorry sweetie i didnt like her very much but why well she used a personal computer at home when she should have used a government computer and she made a lot of moneymaking speeches you risked our future for that dad alan caron is the owner of caron

    "anic bynd is the spark anic is the fire the real future of alternate food is brewing got suggested to post here and as is tradition in my first post in a new subreddit heres the full run down of anic tldr agronomics ticker anic in london agnmf in the us is an investment fund of 20 companies across the emerging lab grown and precision fermentation sector think of it like the sp500 for the future of food most people here have heard of labgrown meat take a painless cell sample from an animal put it in a bioreactor and grow real meat without ever having to kill or cause pain to an animal its essentially a technological fix for factory farming skip the cow grow the burger like petroleum saved the whales twice clean meat can end the suffering of factory farmed animals but the majority of the portfolio is actually precision fermentation pf the process of basically tricking organisms like yeast to produce something other than what theyd normally make for example pf can make lactoferrin a protein worth hundreds per kilo at industrial scale its also being used to make egg and milk protein this is a solved problem and is coming to market now not just moral however it is also economic there is literally not enough land to provide the growing population of the world steak for example the appeal is obvious no animal cruelty massively lower resource use and therefore cheaper to produce why grow a whole animal when you can just grow the part you need not to mention beef with no antibiotics chicken with no salmonella fish with no mercury meat with no parasites truly clean food suddenly any meat is also commercially viable not just the ones we are used to puffin turtle so thats the background but why is anic a good investment part 1 its undervalued anic is currently valued on the market at 77 million as of this post at a discount of around 50 to its net asset value nav which is largely measured by the value of each company in a recent funding round lets look at the portfolio companies how much they have raised anics ownership and what of anics portfolio they are weighting in order of weighting company raised in millions anic owns of portfolio liberation labs 125 377 20 super meat 756 78 11 blu nalu 118 51 9 meatable 100 65 8 onego bio 65 161 8 formo 135 45 6 all g foods 405 8 5 clean food group 13 274 5 every co 233 13 5 solar foods 120 58

microbes 3 42 1 total raised comes to 1986 billion currency conversion numbers mostly from rns tracxn and pitchbook anic has 36 million in cash reserves these numbers partly account for the current value calculation at 145 million leaving anic at around 50 under nav how do we know these valuations are accurate these valuations are confirmed by recent fundraises and companies going public solar foods for example has gone public and their market cap exceeds their total money raised likewise for mosa meats recent public fundraise meanwhile companies that are still private are fighting for limited ag tech funding that has extremely high level levels of due diligence due to the nature of the industry it is unfortunately not treated like the ai industry on the flip side however that means when a company does get funding you can guarantee that the investors are very confident and have done their homework part 2 the triggers the short version we are still early most of these companies are currently building factories right now legislation is being worked on everything is gearing up for release once the numbers come in the results to the share price will speak for themselves specifically though liberation labs the current bottleneck for pf is production capacity liberation labs is finishing its indiana factory early 2026 production is already fully booked out for 5 years from start half the companies in the industry will need to use their factory clean food group just managed to snag a new uk million l facility at auction will produce a precision fermented palm oil alternative a 60b market ripe for disruption formo already selling cheese in 2000 supermarkets in germany planning expansion into the rest of the eu and uk this year blu nalu something big is being announced this year already has partnerships with huge asian multinationals so something along those lines meatly first to release lab grown meat to shelves albeit as pet food about to close big funding deal to make own factories solar foods scaling solein food from air to industrial production in finland estimated 700m revenue when expansion plan finished tropic literally just put the worlds first new banana on shelves recently should be a bigger deal ipos fundraises more portfolio companies going public like solar strengthens nav mosa and meatly likely to ipo regulation clean meat currently being fast tracked through the uk system with a lot of anic portfolio companies involved hoping for legality by end of 2026 part 3 the future ok so ive talked about the background why the company is undervalued right now triggers coming up but what about the future here the sky really is the limit one of the number one concerns right now is the relentless rise in the cost of food that we are literally running out of fish and higher and higher concerns with animal welfare and yet here we have a budding industry that looks to solve all of these things cheaper food with no welfare concerns that is better for the environment clean meat mckinsey projects 25b by 2030 even 10 of the 14t global meat market 140b precision fermentation already commercial disrupts dairy egg specialty proteins could take doubledigit share in cheese yoghurt chocolate infant formula pet food 100b global market pets dont care if its cultivated or fermented early adoption already begun with meatly climate advantage cultivated meat is heading to take up 99 less land use 96 less freshwater and emit 80 less greenhouse gas than traditional production in a process that is actually very similar to fermenting beer and money is pouring in from the eu and other governments because of this food security immune to droughts land limits or supply shocks food from thin air is no longer a metaphor investor case anic is essentially an etf for this 100b transition trading at over 50 below nav part 4 movement a new wave of hype for alternatives is starting with beyond like it did in 2021 dont miss out when anic starts to benefit from this swings finally ill close on this point anic is a penny stock and experiences swings like any other not quite like crypto but still enough to test your mettle i recommend only investing if you have fortitude and a long term mindset aim 100 by february 10x in 3 years tldr clean meat and pf are beginning to revolutionise the food industry in a world where everything just keeps getting more expensive the new alternate hype wave is starting anic owns a significant percentage of the entire market and is running around 50 of its value",

water storage and drought i honestly dont know why we bother paying attention to the cop climate conferencesthe entire thing seems to be a kabuki show longhijacked by energy companies who invariably succeed at blocking even the most modest of reforms now theyre just rubbing it in netzero is dead the eu passed a watered down climate agreement on wednesday before cop30 began the agreement targets a roughly 70 reduction of fossil fuel emissions by 2035 when compared to 1990 levels however that isnt legally binding and critics say that emissions outsourced by the bloc will not count towards their total however they did pass a binding decision to cut emissions by 90 by 2040 this cop brazil is pitching a 125b plan in a scheme that they believe will help about 75 tropical countries profit from protecting their rainforest the idea is simple governments and private investors pay into a large fund then the combined capital is plowed into emerging markets to generate profits which after interest repayments to investors flow to tropical countries with low deforestation rates as confirmed by satellite money comes first as always the united states is allegedly the elephant not in the room wielding an unspoken threat to sabotage serious climate commitments by tariffing or otherwise estranging smaller states that push for ambitious carbon biodiversity targets whats it going to take to make real environmental progress a nature communications psychology study evaluated peoples attitudes in four european countries plus nigeria and the us to answer this question they determined that there was a psychological distance between them and climate change they needed to feel like they were personally affected like with flooding extreme heat etc another successful intervention was to use the principles of system justification theory to frame climate change as threatening the participants way of life specific to their nation and promote climate action as the patriotic response approaches that emphasized the 99 consensus among scientists and the letter to future generations technique were not so helpful an expos into the sierra clubs dwindling influence suggests that their membership cratered after a hard shift towards social justice and away from pure environmentalism humans and other animals generally find effort aversive and avoid it even when exerting effort obtains rewards known as the theory of least effort or effort aversion this aversion to effort is magnified in social contexts where the direct benefit is not immediately for ourselves with people less willing to engage in effortful behaviours that help otherspeople were more willing to choose effortful actions to protect the environment and provide food when the positive impact was greater or the action was easiercomputational modelling precisely captured how individuals devalued proenvironmental benefits by the effort required to obtain them in the absence of intervention participants were more willing to work to provide food to prevent starvation than reduce carbon emissions to mitigate climate change however several psychological interventions particularly based on psychological distance and system justification significantly reduced this bias and increased relative proenvironmental motivation finally motivation to help the environment was associated with both climaterelevant

whistleblower comes forward about uapsdavid grusch dylan borland jake barberthe same question echoes across comment sections and living rooms why would the government keep this a secret the question isnt asked with curiosity its asked as proof of impossibility surely the reasoning goes if the government had recovered alien technology someone would have disclosed it by now the secret is too big to keep therefore it cant be real this logic collapses the moment you consider what the secret actually protects its not about little green men its about oil the global oil and gas industry generated over 4 trillion in profits in 2022 alone over the past 50 years the industry has averaged 28 billion in daily profits if you combined the top 10 fossil fuel companies into a single entity it would have the 8th largest gdp in the worldbetween france and italy this isnt just an industry its the foundation of the global economy now imagine the government announces weve had technology since 1947 that could have provided unlimited clean energy weve kept it classified for 80 years and here it is what happens next the entire global power structurebuilt on energy scarcitycollapses overnight the petrodollar the real national security the suppression isnt about national security in the traditional sense its about maintaining the petrodollar systemthe 1974 ussaudi arrangement ensuring oil is priced exclusively in us dollars creating constant global demand for the dollar and us treasury assets house oversight committee this system provides the united states with unparalleled economic advantages including the ability to borrow cheaply and run chronic deficits without facing the immediate pressure of currency collapse house oversight committee it finances a global network of hundreds of overseas bases and gives washington a powerful economic weapon control of dollarbased transactions to reward allies and punish adversaries house oversight committee translation american global dominance is built on oil dependence break the dependence break the dominance consider what happened to iraq in 2003 saddam hussein announced he would sell oil in euros instead of dollars under the un oil for food program house oversight committee months later the us invaded after the invasion iraq immediately switched back to dollardenominated oil sales house oversight committee coincidence the math is simple if breakthrough energy technology existszeropoint energy field propulsion compact fusion anything that doesnt require combustionthen releasing it would eliminate the 4 trillion annual oil industry destroy the petrodollar system end us economic hegemony collapse the wealth of oilproducing states redistribute global power render obsolete trillions in infrastructure refineries

petrostates saudi arabia russia uae kuwait venezuela financial institutions those holding trillions in oilrelated assets wealthy individuals billionaires and dynasties whose fortunes are built on oil energy infrastructure and the current economic order the us government maintains dollar dominance and global power projection defense contractors wars for oil are profitable utilities centralized energy control monopoly profits who loses if the secret gets out everyone listed above who wins the rest of humanity all 8 billion of us the invention secrecy act the legal framework for suppression this isnt speculation the infrastructure for suppressing breakthrough technology is documented and active the invention secrecy act of 1951 passed just four years after roswell allows the government to classify any patent deemed detrimental to national security right now over 5000 patents are under secrecy orders we dont know what they are we dont know who filed them we only know the government wont let us see them how many of those 5000 patents are energyrelated propulsionrelated materials science breakthroughs that would undermine the current system well never know thats the point the cost of the secret while the secret is kept the human cost accumulates resource wars iraq libya syria yemenmillions dead for oil climate change climaterelated disasters cost the worlds poorest communities tens of billions annually while the oil industry invested just 4 of capital expenditure on clean energy in 2023 energy poverty billions lack reliable electricity artificial scarcity prices manipulated to maximize profit stunted progress 80 years of suppressed technological advancement if breakthrough technology has been classified since 1947 then every gallon of gas youve ever purchased every oil war every climate disaster every person who died without electricityall of it was preventable they chose profits over people for eight decades the pattern is clear when you understand that the secret protects oil everything else makes sense why whistleblowers face espionage charges instead of being thanked why aaro denies everything despite sworn testimony why the invention secrecy act exists why the national archives slowwalks declassification why scientists with relevant expertise file patents decades after working on classified programs why anyone who threatens the petrodollar system faces consequences ask saddam ask gaddafi why you dont see clear uap pictures or videos they likely have the ability to scrub the internet of anything compelling this isnt about aliens its about control control of energy control of wealth control of power the question isnt why would they keep this a secret the question is with trillions of dollars at stake how could they possibly tell the truth url

    "exploring the diverse ecosystems of arkansas land a biodiversity hotspot introduction arkansas often referred to as the natural state is a treasure trove of natural wonders encompassing a variety of ecosystems that contribute to its rich biodiversity from the rugged ozark mountains to the fertile delta plains arkansas boasts a unique blend of habitats that support an array of flora and fauna this article delves into the diverse ecosystems of arkansas examining their significance and the conservation efforts aimed at preserving this biodiversity hotspot the ozark mountains geography and climate the ozark mountain region located in northwestern arkansas covers approximately 47000 square miles and features rugged terrain deep valleys and rolling hills with elevations reaching over 2500 feet the ozarks experience a temperate climate characterized by four distinct seasons this climatic variability contributes to the regions ecological diversity flora and fauna the ozarks are home to diverse plant communities including oakhickory forests pine forests and various wildflower species oak trees dominate the landscape providing habitat for numerous animal species the welldrained rocky soil supports an array of herbaceous plants while the dense underbrush serves as critical shelter for many animals wildlife in the ozarks includes whitetailed deer black bear wild turkeys and various songbirds the region is particularly noted for its reptilian and amphibian diversity including the striking eastern box turtle and various species of frogs and salamanders that thrive in the moist microhabitats found here conservation challenges despite its ecological richness the ozark mountains face several threats including deforestation urbanization and climate change conservation efforts such as reforestation projects and protected areas like the ozark national forest aim to mitigate these impacts organizations like the ozark society tirelessly work to preserve the natural beauty and biodiversity of this region the arkansas river valley geography and climate the arkansas river valley runs alongside the arkansas river one of the most significant waterways in the region characterized by flat lands and rolling hills this area has a humid subtropical climate resulting in mild winters and hot summers flora and fauna the arkansas river valley boasts diverse ecosystems from cottonwood forests along riverbanks to upland hardwood forests the floodplain areas are particularly rich in biodiversity supporting species like the endangered interior least tern and various migratory birds wetlands in the region are crucial for amphibian breeding and serve as habitat for migration stopover for many waterfowl additionally the valleys agricultural practices have led to the introduction of several nonnative species that impact local ecosystems conservation efforts the arkansas river valley is central to conservation initiatives including habitat restoration and sustainable agricultural practices various organizations work to educate farmers on environmentally friendly methods that preserve the ecological integrity of the valley while maintaining agricultural productivity the arkansas delta geography and climate the delta region of arkansas is characterized by its wet lowlying flatlands it showcases a subtropical climate and is known for its rich soils which have historically supported extensive agriculture particularly cotton and rice farming flora and fauna the delta is home to an extensive array of ecosystems including wetlands swamps and bottomland forests these habitats are critical for many wildlife species including the american alligator various wading birds and migratory waterfowl bottomland hardwood forests are among the most biodiverse ecosystems in the delta providing crucial habitat for numerous species the interconnected wetlands support both aquatic and terrestrial life making the region vital for ecological balance conservation challenges the delta faces significant threats from agricultural runoff habitat loss and climate change leading to increased flooding and altered hydrology conservation efforts in the delta include the establishment of the white river national wildlife refuge and initiatives aimed at preserving wetland habitats the ouachita mountains geography and climate the ouachita mountains located in westcentral arkansas represent a geologically distinct area with a significantly different ecosystem compared to the surrounding regions the mountains have a generally mild climate that contributes to the diverse flora and fauna found here flora and fauna the ouachita mountains are known for their rich biodiversity including diverse species of hardwoods pines and wildflowers the mixed forests provide habitat for a variety of wildlife including black bears deer and a plethora of bird species rare species such as the ozark hellbender a large aquatic salamander highlight the ecological richness of the ouachitas the region also serves as a critical habitat for migratory birds that seek refuge in the diverse landscapes during their seasonal travels conservation efforts the ouachita national forest plays a pivotal role in conservation protecting vast tracts of natural landscapes and ensuring sustainable management of resources efforts to restore degraded habitats and promote ecotourism are essential for preserving the regions biodiversity for future generations the crowleys ridge geography and climate crowleys ridge is a distinct geological formation stretching from the northeastern to southeastern part of the state characterized by its hilly terrain amidst the surrounding flatlands this ridge offers a unique microclimate that supports diverse vegetation compared to the adjacent lowlands flora and fauna the diverse ecosystems of crowleys ridge include dry upland forests wetlands and prairie remnants species like the eastern bluebird and numerous butterflies thrive here while unique plant species such as the endangered crowleys ridge wildflower add to the ecological significance of this region conservation strategies conservation strategies in crowleys ridge focus on restoring native habitats and protecting endangered species local organizations work toward habitat preservation by engaging the community through educational programs and volunteer activities unique species and their habitats arkansas hosts numerous species that are either endemic or highly specialized further contributing to its status as a biodiversity hotspot endemic and threatened species the ozark region is home to unique species such as the ozark cavefish and the arkansas darter both of which face threats from habitat destruction and changes in water quality many wetland species including the elusive sora rail and various turtle species also require specific habitat conditions to thrive importance of pollinators bees butterflies and other pollinators play a critical role in arkansass ecosystems supporting both wild plants and agricultural crops the decline in these species due to habitat loss and pesticide use is alarming prompting initiatives aimed at conserving pollinator habitats aquatic ecosystems lakes and rivers arkansas is dotted with numerous lakes and rivers including the expansive arkansas river and bull shoals lake both of which host diverse aquatic life these water bodies provide habitat for fish amphibians and aquatic invertebrates contributing to local biodiversity wetlands wetlands particularly in the delta are vital for maintaining water quality and providing habitat for numerous wildlife species they serve as breeding grounds for amphibians and migratory stopover points for birds underscoring their importance in ecological networks conservation actions efforts to protect arkansass aquatic ecosystems involve wetland restoration projects and pollution management programs aimed at improving water quality collaborative partnerships between government agencies ngos and local communities are key to ensuring the health of these vital ecosystems the role of biodiversity in ecosystem health diverse ecosystems are crucial for maintaining ecological balance supporting everything from nutrient cycling to pest regulation biodiversity provides resilience enabling environments to adapt to changes and disturbances whether natural or humaninduced ecosystem services the ecosystems of arkansas deliver essential services including clean water climate regulation and crop pollination the interdependence among species and their habitats illustrates the intricate balance that sustains life within these ecosystems public awareness and education raising public awareness about the importance of biodiversity is crucial for conservation efforts educational programs in schools and community workshops can help cultivate a deeper appreciation for arkansass unique ecosystems fostering a sense of stewardship among residents conclusion arkansas stands as a remarkable biodiversity hotspot with its diverse ecosystems supporting a wealth of plant and animal life however the challenges posed by urbanization climate change and agricultural practices threaten this natural heritage by understanding the richness of arkansass biodiversity and advocating for its preservation we can ensure the sustainable future of these ecosystems for generations to come through conservation efforts public education and community involvement we can celebrate and protect the diverse ecosystems that make arkansas truly the natural state as stewards of the land its our responsibility to ensure that this biodiversity hotspot continues to thrive maintaining the delicate balance of life that sustains our planet additional information",
    "a one piece spinoff so originally i had assumed that maybe blackbeard was the one attacking mary jois but now i feel like this isnt the only case god valley to me feels like a hotpot of backstories by which i mean theres no reason to have this flashback out of nowhere if it has nothing to do with whats happening currently in one piece that coupled with vegapunk prerecorded livestream about a climate change and with the recent destruction of lulusia a kingdom allied with the revolutionaries amongst many other nations seems to elude to this being larger in scale than just one group my guess is that this is actually caused by a shabby coalition of different revolutionary kingdoms and pirates and probably marines as wellmost likely sword who yknow probably realize that they could become the next lulusia if they dont do anything and with the revolutionary army straining their resources this could be the perfect time for an alliance that and imu rolling out to annex elbaf weve got a lot of big characters as well like gaban and loki that and shamrock being there leads me to believe the redhaired pirates are on their way as well they did promise to not let elbaf be a battle ground after all this will be a perfect time for shanks to reunite with luffy and hisshanks twin brother all of this points to one conclusion were currently the final war of one piece or one pieces fourth great ninja war so many things are happening and theyre happening on multiple fronts theres no way this would just be a short scuffle that ends with luffy somehow escaping elbaf finding the one piece them going back to fight imu it would feel very weird point is so many revelations are coming to light that were possibly looking at something thats gonna be biggerlonger than the raid on onigashima and wider in scope featuring even more prominent characters in fact i wouldnt be shocked if it turns out some god knights have invaded wano as well although with said straining of resources im sure wano will be fine maybe some surviving whitebeard pirates will go to protect wano marco did go there after all during the raid point is this is shaping up to be big so big that future revalation are gonna overshadow the one piece mystery itself to which im saying whats happening right now and whats about to happen will be so big and so world changing that itll make finding the one piece feel like a sidequest the war and its aftermath are probably going to be the final arc of the series as a whole and the main focus of the finale which is why i think that one piece is probably going to end with the conclusions of the final war luffy defeats imu the marines break away from the world government and align with the revolutionaries as a sort of new government with coby probably being the new fleet admiralpoetic justice for marineford and sabo as some sort of revolutionary world leader and theyll combine to take out pirates because we know most pirates arent good people and irradicate the cd and any remaining traces of the wg we are most likely going to see the one piece and raftel but i dont think we would get an indepth explanation of what exactly we are looking at theres most likely going to be a cut off after that with luffy being announced the new king of the pirates and then the series ends this is where my posts title comes in just like bleach with tybw and naruto with boruto well most likely get a sort of sequelprequel to one piece which would feature the longest flashback that weve ever seen the void century we know oda didnt just come up with the void century in a couple of months its something that hes been working on for at least a decade puting it all together and changing and rearranging some stuff to make sure the reveal is shockingand probably funny as well it would make sense for oda to give the void century room to breath in its own spinoff rather than to treat it as some sort of flashback when we already have a giant war and the god valley flashback as well a spin off would probably allow him to flash out his ideas perfectly without the need to rush ive heard some people complain about god valley feeling rushed and without treating it like some oneoff flashback whatll most likely happen in this spinoff is maybe theyll be a timeskip and theres a classroom of marines and fleet admiral coby is teaching the class about luffy the hero who saved the world just like how sengoku was telling marines about rocks who was like a legendary figure by then and then itll cut to the strawhats going to raftel and we get more explicit well flashedout detail of what exactly were looking at before we cut to another flashback to the void century and joy boy i dont know but i wanna know from you with how big everything is shaping up to be and probably new and even more shocking revelations on the way how do you think oda is gonna make it so that when this is all concludes the one piece will still stand out above it all not just inworld but also story wise in simpler terms since were in the final arc and a great war is brewing how do you think oda is gonna transition from the final war to the one piece mystery",

    "the heart of the harappans life was harsh in ancient india and bronze age people were likely more traumatized by the natural world than we are even with the climate change we are living through now so in an era when people were required to be extremely resilient how did the harappans soften enough to build a truly nourishing society not just a functional one lets go beyond just archaeology and into the realm of the heart of the harappans i see their cities and their feats of engineering as a psychological and civic buffer against the chaos of the natural world i think the reason they became so highly developed was that they were a loving people because the india that the harappans lived in was a hard place to survive in that india had unpredictable monsoons floods droughts disease and the constant demand of daily hard labour under a fierce sun their lives were filled with uncertainty far more than we deal with today so in harappan life creating order out of chaos and creating supportive infrastructure that made even the lowliest citizens feel less alone was a way to reassure people that their rights matter that they were included and the city would only prosper when every citizen prospered their urban life was cooperative not hierarchical no kings no armies no royal tombs yet we find careful burial offerings they sent their dead into the afterlife with all the nice things they could manage ceramic vessels bangles beads etc these were a people who refused to let the harshness of bronze age life harden their hearts look at their art we dont seen war scenes or any overall theme of glorifying battle and bloodshed instead we see scenes from nature calm meditating figures dancing figures and beautiful ornaments and toys i repeat they did not live in a gentle world ancient india was a harsh place without all of our modern amenities the harappans did not live in a world where you could just sit in the jungle and calmly meditate away your problems and yet we see how much they valued this outlook on life they valued harmony with nature while also taking action to learn engineering and master nature modern india can learn a lot from ancient india the harappans understood that knowing how to sustain an equal society is a valuable survival skill i think one reasons the harappans were able to thrive as much as they did was because they realized how important it was to foster respect communication and sharing to collectively lift their society up they opened their hearts to each other we know this because it takes a lot of trust to share power especially political power when you dont trust people thats when youre more likely to grab power name yourself king and steal everyone elses treasures but thats not what the harappans did though clearly they had the technology to build an evil empire if they wanted to instead they seem to have sat down for a civic meeting and said lets put it all on the line by actually daring to trust each other enough to share power share resources and share authority i believe it took guts to do that may we have the guts to follow their example",

    "prologue of epica this is a short excerpt of the prologue i plan for a series im making called epica what are your thoughts on it be objective and dont feel hesitant to criticize im open to feedback chapter 1 the planck epoch imagine a sentient world a universe capable of thought and feeling at his birth time and space were created and his expansion began from a singular hot point there was one unified force until he began to cool for billions of years he remained comatose unknowing of his own existence the universe was beginning its infancy and as things began to settle he gained sentience much like a baby becoming selfaware his body was the universe though he was able to explore his own reaches through a concentrated avatar from pure thought his avatar being made of his consciousness allowed him to transport himself across the universe in mere moments though he wasnt omnipresent his body was proportional to that of anyone elses one may not know what happens with every single cell in their body but possesses a general awareness oriion had a general awareness of how large he was and the forces that existed within him realizing he was alive billions of years into existence came an innate yearning to make up for the time lost at the moment of his awakening he did what any young being sprawled into a new world would do venture throughout his explorations he mostly saw an indescribable emptiness nothing persisted but eventually he saw fantastic celestial objects he numbered each of them until he lost count he observed planets and noted their features he saw the dust of nebulae collapse into burning stars he studied how each particle interacted with each other and started gaining an understanding of elements as time progressed he began assessing the threshold of his own power he discovered that he possessed the ability to move the objects in his own universal body with ease manipulate forces like gravity and electromagnetism influence the local laws of physics and possess a general omniscience of what happens within his cosmos with these abilities came an innate understanding to conduct this power with due regard this understanding would influence his interactions in the future chapter 2 the archean age throughout his travels hed make contact with the first signs of life on a planet designated terras in a star system located in the outer edges of the universe terras existed as a larger teal planet with strong gravity the climate was harsh with diamond rain and snow storms being a common occurrence it had an icy surface but was warm enough to host life that originated in caves terras resided in the habitable zone of its star system and possessed a thick atmosphere rich in alien elements the planets colossal mass allowed its atmosphere to persist furthermore a magnetic field protected terras from cosmic radiation which allowed its early lifeforms to evolve at a given pace with ease since terras bears a strong gravitational force its lifeforms evolved to be shorter in size for the ancestors of the terrakin the protokin that meant their general heights would be up to 4 feet in stature until theyd grow taller as they evolved as they originated in caves to keep warm they fed on lesser cave beings like terracytes and terrafins which are the aquatic life found in caves or their oceans when they became more civilized and technological theyd farm on mudgrain or geofruit which would eventually become their general sources of energy prior to their advancements they sported a short frame but robust body they possessed four limbs like a humanoid which was effective for traveling long distances and handling tools they were a unique classification of life adorned with silver colored skin that was thick enough for traversing rough terrain the strongest of the protokin had the strength to punch up to two tons which was useful for getting boulders out of the way protokin had poor eyesight due to the dark caves they dwelled in but in turn they were able to sense infrared and gravity fields as time passed most would lose those senses as they adapted to other climates climates they wouldnt have ventured in if not for the help of oriion himself he first made contact with them in their early beginnings exploring the desolate parts of terras oriion was perplexed at seeing life for the first time he was used to the abiotic characteristics of all the objects he observed but not the biotic ones for the first time he realized he wasnt alone and at that moment he felt the sentiment of solace of course in the perspective of the protokin they initially feared his looming avatar he would shorten his avatar in size so that they would be more familiar with them as if he were one of them and would go on to take the form of a humanoid as oriion observed them they became more familiar with him they saw similarities in him and began to trust him more oriion helped them in their endeavors to expand their populations as there were a mere several thousand of them at the time any severe weather that occurred near them oriion would merely cast away not only that he would reshape the planet to be more suitable for biodiversity readjusting its orbit and manipulating their homestars magnetic field so that it may last longer this allowed the protokin to be fruitful and flourish oriion would go on to show them what hed learn of the universe like a cosmic guide he helped them discover new foods like geofruit and mudgrain to expand their diets geofruit in particular was a specialized fruit created by crystallike plants rooted deep in the soil that siphoned energy from geothermal sources its mere nutrients slowly changed the physiology of the protokins over time via its own biochemicals unlocking a gene which allowed them to possess unique abilities amongst themselves protokins would exhibit different traits and started becoming more dissimilar from one another one protokins gene allowed them to possess super strength that allowed them to punch with 10 tons of force others genes allowed them to run at faster speeds up to 200 mph the gene would become the staple of modern terrakins and their uniqueness amongst other species and as centuries passed oriion and the protokin learned together the protokin steadily changed but oriion remained stagnant he led their people into new territories and ages leading them on expeditions across terras building them structures and sharing knowledge about the universe with them oriion brought resources and foreign samples that they could analyze for him while oriion would venture to find more studying them gave further insight into local biology physics chemistry cosmology and the overall science of oriion their numbers would steadily grow and they would utilize crystalline structures used for shelter and advanced machinery that allowed for transportation health and more advanced versions of spaceships wormhole generators and space suits were used to traverse the cosmos oriion with the help of the protokin would develop language that would later on to become universal amongst all species that inhabited oriion with all the knowledge oriion had gained since allying with the protokin came abrupt oblivion new information would replace old information and oriion would therein experience the plight of forgetfulness which typically posed an issue with many creatures possessing the characteristic of longevity as oriion forgot things the protokin soon noted them down for him which would in turn become the catalyst that forms the archives of oriion this was a colossal database that stored information and secrets only known to that of oriion himself oriion entrusted a select number of genius and wise people with his erudition designating them as members of the council of oriion chapter 3 the stelliferous era the council of oriion is the most intelligent beings chosen to moderate oriion the protokin realized that oriion possessed godlike power and some of them worried that he may abuse it in the future in a coup against them to ensure their trust oriion established the council so that they may manage any major decision in truth the council knew there was no way to truly enforce any edicts onto oriion but as long as oriion complied he would be in good graces with the protokin which was always subject to change oriion respects the council so that they may respect him he treats them as his leader even if he may not agree with them from time to time even if he could theoretically destroy them at any given whim factions of the protokin wanted oriion to leave them to their own destinies while most others welcomed his aid since oriion assigned the council the responsibility to safeguard all of his buried knowledge this would lend more credence to oriions loyalty to the protokin oriion transported an exoplanet from a nearby sector and placed it within the orbit of the terras system this planet would be known as sophus which stored the database for the archives of oriion and was heavily guarded by the council with this being established the process of delegating the members of the council of oriion included examinations that evaluated their intellect in regards to biology physics and science in general as the protokin evolved into the terrakin they spread their influence to intergalactic scales with the help of oriion they ventured through the universe and soon found more life after more exploration there were the etherians of etheria who were capable of absorbing lightning as energy then there were the gaians of gaia who lived on a supercontinent of a green planet they made contact with more intelligent societies and offered them a haven on their newly terraformed home planet previously known as terras now known as nexus cultures and communities throughout the cosmos were accepted into the protection of the terrakin and oriion with the dawn of this new age rising came new tensions accusations of speciesism became common seeing that oriion spent most of his time lending aid to the terrakin for centuries whilst races such as the etherians were left to their own crises like the deadly electric storms that nearly brought their kind to extinction oriion would frequently refute these allegations citing that he was unaware of the existence of foreign life yet many would doubt his responses he would ultimately embody contrition for not coming to the aid of the new species sooner to foreign species the terrakin were seen as coddled their civilization had a head start as opposed to others despite this notion the terrakin would regard it with high esteem extraterrestrials began populating nexus and it became the home planet for many species though as societies merged came new rules of law the mission of the council is referred to as two duties reduce suffering and promote felicity the council of oriion has determined that these unique endeavors be prohibited 1 time travel via reversing and forwarding time other than the typical process of its linear progression towards the future is forbidden to ensure proper stability of the spacetime continuum seeing as most of the council are not familiar with the subject nor its prospective outcomes 2 bioengineering in any sense which includes but is not limited to interspecies breeding cloning and gene editing is forbidden to ensure no one can abuse its capabilities 3 artificial intelligence whether lesser or of superior intellect is forbidden to ensure that no reasoning entity may be enslaved nor have their capabilities be abused 4 mass surveillance via observing intelligent lifeforms without their expressed consent or strict understanding of the party being there is forbidden though is mainly applied to oriion himself 5 resurrection of any dead lifeform is forbidden unless naturally caused to ensure the veneration and inviolability of the dead 6 finally physical harm outside of defense which includes but is not limited to murder is forbidden to ensure the reduction of suffering across all forms of life these are the current forbidden acts that all species under the protection of oriion and the council must abide by certain subsets of endeavors are also prohibited interspecies relationships promote offspring of hybrid origin and so this act is deemed as bioengineering and therefore barred indubitably many lifeforms disregard this particular prohibited activity due to emotional interests typically those relationships are made secret so as to not be made subject to punitive action there are exemptions in regards to few rules in which the council typically vote in which situation the prohibited activities may be used if it can contribute to the mission of reducing suffering and promoting felicity or if the perceived subsets of certain prohibited activities do not fall under the definition of said prohibited activity computers and probes contain information but do not fall under the definition of artificial intelligence which is of mere sentient intelligence regardless of rules most living beings strive for pleasure this collective effort requires a focused organization that may enforce these values and so this would be the beginnings of venturia prime these would become the heroes defenders and explorers of oriion chapter 4 the diamond age venturians are typically assigned to protect life explore unknown territories and recruit new venturians these assignments make it so that oriion isnt the only one to carry out these operations and may delegate time to more prioritized duties the council prefers to keep advanced technology out of the hands of venturians and commonfolk but will allow it in certain conditions such as for language translators life suits or super ships their reasoning is that revolutionary technology could potentially be abused generally speaking rules are not utilized in the effort to enforce order but rather a guideline which is to reduce suffering if someone under venturian rule purposefully performs a decision that leads to suffering they may be subject to punishment after a report is filed for the innumerable amount of duties tasked to the venturians are where trials are required new recruits are poised to undergo tests to determine their limits whether that be if they can survive the vacuum of space and for how long cope with extreme temperatures ranging from cold to hot withstand cosmic radiation endure physical forces or resist the overloading of senses depending on how they fare they will be given missions that they may or may not accept depending on the scale of their strengths and weaknesses after theyve earned the title of venturian they will undergo irregular competitions to further determine their levels of power whether these championships are held annually quarterly or daily as well as the amount members of the championship are at the discretion of the council of oriion these championships will determine who may be the strongest venturian among them all and those strongest will be referred to as the adventurians these members are held to the highest regard of venturia prime and interact with the council of oriion much often they will be considered for the most crucial missions those who choose to quit will not be punished but are typically looked down on by other venturians these championships require immense space so that collateral damage will be minimized therefore the colossal sand planet designated xerath would be placed in the terras system by oriion himself it would be one of many planets added to the terras system with the ark planets joining in",

    "drive engine the informational geometry of motion part 1 united theory of everything drive engine the informational geometry of motion part i the theoretical model and geometric closure expanded

the validated curvature law becomes prescriptive it can guide stabilization across complex systemsfrom climate dynamics to neural architectures and financial networks resilience emerges as a hierarchy astro bio neuro ai governed not by brute energy management but by structural control of coupling and integration thus the utoe transforms from a descriptive geometry of stability into a prescriptive engine of adaptive prudence introduction the universal instability problem all organized systems exist in partial disequilibrium from atomic lattices to galactic filaments each must continuously resolve the universal instability problem how to increase productive drive without succumbing to either entropic dissolution or rigid stasis survival demands equilibrium between three forces of complexity drive energy input and intent coupling structural connectivity integration coherence or informational unity traditional modelsfrom boltzmanns statistical mechanics to fristons freeenergy principleseek invariants of stability yet none unify the hierarchy of systems across scales the utoe proposes that this invariant is not energetic but geometric the curvature of informational space the law of prudential saturation asserts 0 sustainable organization when curvature stabilizes internal fluctuations remain bounded and the system achieves a selfconsistent flow of order this paper establishes the mathematical bridge between that symbolic law and its empirical geometry proving that utoe curvature is a quantitative measure of the constraint landscape within which information can persist and perform work phase the theoretical model and geometric foundation 1 the symbolic law and geometric reduction at the core of the utoe framework lies the law of informational curvature this relation compresses the systems highdimensional stability geometry into three observable macroparameters it is not heuristic but a firstorder geometric reduction of the fisherrao scalar curvature fr c fr ofr here c is a scaling constant linking statistical curvature to measurable informational energy density this equivalence confirms that utoe represents the systems curvature energy density the informational analogue of potential energy in mechanics in this interpretation governs how local modes couple to the whole injects active flux and encodes integration over state space together they constitute a tensorial field whose scalar projection is the curvature 2 modes of operation n 1 and 2 the organizational strategy of any coherent system is defined by its mode index n two principal phases emerge naturally from the curvature law exploratory mode n 1 linear dependence on encourages structural fluidity and phasespace search noise is permitted as a vector of discovery such systems operate at the edge of chaos as in creative neural ensembles or turbulent plasmas seeking coherent states evaluative mode n 2 quadratic dependence penalizes fluctuations locking the structure into precision and stability this mode governs execution and control from ai inference to economic equilibria and planetary climate feedback loops both modes are limiting cases of a continuous spectrum controlled by nt the system shifts along this spectrum to sustain prudential equilibrium as environmental pressure changes 3 the condition for existence prudential saturation a system exists only if its curvature can stabilize the law of prudential saturation formalizes this constraint 0 fr t 0 at local equilibrium the gradient of the fisherrao curvature approaches zero in physical language the informational cost of creating new structure equals the maintenance energy of the existing one if 0 the system diverges toward entropy if 0 it locks into rigidity and loses adaptivity only 0 permits continuous existence this law is identical in form to the lyapunov condition for bounded trajectories and the thermodynamic criterion of minimum entropy production hence prudence is not a moral metaphor but a geometric necessity 4 curvature dynamics and information flow let the informational state vector be x the evolution of x obeys fx n 1 2 2 within the prudence domain the system converges to the fixed point 095 2 linearization yields negative eigenvalues thus prudence guarantees global asymptotic stability geometrically the field lines of this vector flow trace closed curvature loops selfstabilizing attractors in informational space 5 dimensional closure and physical equivalence to bridge symbol and substance define the dimensional map 1 s j s m j m the informational torque then emerges naturally as tmax nm thus the utoe law is dimensionally closed information curvature produces physical work it is no longer a metaphor but an engine 6 interpretation information as geometry of motion prudence binds energy and information in a single metric when rises coherence condenses into usable curvature when rises that curvature dissipates as entropy sustainable motion requires their ratio to remain bounded by the drive therefore acts as a curvature rectifier transforming stochastic informational flux into directional mechanical torque its law is not imposed but emergent prudence arises whenever information learns to preserve itself next phase dynamic control theory phase i establishes the symbolic geometry and its closure with empirical curvature phase ii will introduce the dynamic control architecture where the adaptive mode index nt evolves to maintain prudential saturation under real perturbations in that domain the drive ceases to be a static law and becomes a living

    "golden fields chapter one golden fields hello all my name is colin a romance and science fiction author i have been writing this stand alone piece for a while and have been hammering out weekly chapters for a few months now i have asked the mods due to the fmc female main character being a minotaur like species i posted a picture of her here with their blessing i plan on posting chapters here along with my other locations i hope you enjoy this story colin graves the heavy winds of montanas tobacco root range rolled in across the prairies kicking choking dust up into the air the coarse sand spilled from the precambrian rock formations spattered throughout the valley marking the ancient passage of glaciers from thousands of years earlier the multistory spires of ancient sunbleached sandstone stood tall but when compared to the equally grey mountains beyond the valleys pinecovered foothills they might as well have been an insignificant nothingness ants standing before eldritch gods but that form of ancient wonder was not something that held the attention of a lone figure trundling down an old dirt road thin scrub grass scratched his pressed pants their little fingers grabbed and tore loose every thread of wool they could the dry silt clung to every nook and cranny of his once pristine leather dress shoes as small rocks were crushed beneath each footfall every plodding step adding to the neverending dust an ancient and unknowable enemy of mankind was taking its toll on him an invisible beast but one that assured you paid your cost in mucus dried eyes and fits of sneezing allergies he coughed and spat out phlegm again before wiping his brow with the white buttondown sleeve of his shirt leaving the material stained with wet dust and ruining the shirt typically he would have been upset about his shirt being soiled but after wearing the same clothes for a week straight without a chance to wash them all he had left to wear was already destroyed can you shut the fuck up luke yelled up at the sky moments after an agricultural drone buzzed overhead its whirring repulsion engines grating on his last nerve never in his life had he believed that everything he had planned for years could fall apart in a matter of seconds but somehow it happened to him a soontobe fiancgone all of his socalled friendsabandoned him even his own mother thought he was some monster in human skin after the lies she had propagated initially when luke saw jackie in their room with he would rather not think about what he had seen or what she had done recounting what happened before he ran from his old life still hurt like glass shards being driven into his brain it still made him dry heave and gag a week postrevelation of how fake their love had been luke had assumed his flight from olympus mons university and silence about what happened would not have meant much beyond having to alert a few people of where he was going but the effects were far beyond that now he was all alone within the vast universe his doctorate was in question because the dean of the agricultural department bought that liars story without question and revoked his scholarships placing him on probation due to integrity violations that they had been working together for nearly a decade meant nothing to professor swate when jackie put on the waterworks and twisted her betrayal into illicit accusations against his morality the only person back at olympus mons university who supported luke was doctor harold dimula lukes longtime genetics and applied agricultural growth teacher his support was undoubtedly what kept luke from indulging in a sinful meal of alkaloid botany dimula bless him gave luke a lessthanlethal path to escape the situation he felt pity after seeing how far the once brighteyed and eager graduate student had fallen to alcohol and selfloathing that nonfatal solution to his problems was not some proof to clear his name of assault nor would it set the world right but it did offer him sanctuary all it would cost luke was his presence expertise in 24thcentury farming and agriculture and the willingness to do whatever the owner expected to ensure the ranchs success the ranch had been scraping by for years and had been in desperate need of assistance luke asked why they had never hired people when problems began to occur but dimula never gave luke an answer that made sense something about his answer still seemed wrong like he was not telling luke the entire story well kurkel is a stubborn man and he probably did not feel spending what little money they had would fix the issues dimula had explained he is a real pull yourself up by the bootstraps kind of man you know the type luke indeed knew the type and expected this ranch to be troubled by the same issue he had seen many times while earning his masters degree and his now nevertobe doctorate the farmer was stubborn stuck in their ways and did not wish to adapt to modern tools and techniques resulting in them falling behind in production a sinful thing that the coalition of planets had sent more failures to an applicable skills camp for stubborn old farmers were a tale as old as time luke just hoped this time would be a different case he had fruitlessly battled enough old timers when it came to fixing their fields and plants doing so again was not an appealing idea luke especially hoped so because if the farmer were lugged off to a skill camp it would cost him the three hots and a cot something he was in desperate need of here on earth he didnt know anyone dimulas friend was lukes only connection to his species cradle world if this did not pan out luke had no idea where he would go luke looked down at his data slate and groaned there were still another four hours of walking to reach the entrance to his friend kurkels ranch golden fields if that lazy driver had taken him all the way to the ranch luke would have been there hours ago and hopefully already burying himself within whatever work the ranch needed but apparently going the last few miles down the road into the old dusty town of grey rock and hanging a left onto the only road leading to golden fields was unfeasible the man complained that the dirt and rocks would scratch his car that was nothing but an excuse to take the money and run leaving the rider high and dry in fact such a scam was a standard issue across coalition space because payment had to be given upfront for services it was in the cabbies best interest to cut and run they already had their money after all with no other choice on how to reach his destination luke soldiered on marching through the montana early spring heat without faltering despite his sour mood luke had to appreciate the beauty of this place endless rolling fields touched the mountain foothills farms of varying types could be seen just as far the only thing breaking up the infinite continuity was the babbling of brooks or the distant sound of service roads cattle grazed beneath the shade offered by the gargantuan solar kites cabled almost half a mile in the air the shadows cast by those monumental creations of industry were like stationary clouds always offering one reprieve from the heat and scalding radiation sol emitted not only did the local fauna find them as a place to seek shelter as luke crested a small hillock and the town of grey rock came into view a group of local teenagers waved at him from beneath one of the kites while they lounged in a small brook he returned the gesture and momentarily considered hopping the fence to grab a drink after one of the scantily clad girls offered him a beer he decided against it shouting thanks but no thanks in a crackly dry voice by the time he was almost to the towns outskirts a new sound grew into the orchestra of natures bounty a dull thrumming noise arose and eventually overtook the bleating of goats the mooing of cattle and the whistling wind through the solar kite cables it was the sound of a vehicle an old combustion engine and tires on dirt luke had never heard one in person before they were not used on mars at all and even here on earth they were considered archaic and only used in heavyduty industries where the torque they allowed was needed or in places like this town towns where earth forgot and they preferred it that way a small town full of people happy with small uneventful lives well hello there lad where you heading a male voice said loudly overpowering the sounds of the engine as the truck pulled up from behind luke and stopped the man looked old and wellworn with wrinkled tan skin grey hair and a set of overalls that were barely held together by rough handsewn stitching compared to the man the vehicle looked young hardbodied steel spattered with rust its oncevibrant green paint and the logo on the cabs side were barely discernible golden fields luke replied clearing his brow with his sleeve yet again what makes you ask spotted you a few miles back right when you walked past my place the man replied he jutted a thumb over his shoulder back at the johnson place you walked right by my mailbox and i figured you looked a little lost so i just wanted to make sure you were alright luke thought of it for a moment and recalled the house and the lone mailbox the aforementioned house loomed atop one of the hills surrounded by miles and miles of barley and rhubarb the sprouts waved steadily like an ocean between the road and the old prairiestyle home he could even recall this old rambling truck parked beside it ah i see luke replied luke had to admit he did look quite out of place around here he was dressed like a lost lawyer not a farmhand or a local by any means that this old mans sharp green eyes spotted the interloper within their midst was not shocking every time luke went to a new farming community he was quickly assessed as an outsider and treated as such it was not that the sapients in those places were insular and hated him they just showed both hesitant caution of outgroups and wanted to ensure he did not wander into places he had no right to be in he was lucky enough to never have dealt with the latter issue but he had heard tales of other contracted agricultural researchers and workers stumbling upon illicit narcotic productions or scandalous affairs the locals never appreciated them finding what should have been well hidden as such the outsider was run out of town not unlike the tax collectors of the old american colonies nearly five hundred years earlier so learning from the follies of his contemporaries and predecessors luke took the man up on the offer for a ride through town and to the destination where he would bury his old life to whither and ultimately be forgotten hank johnson the man said extending a wellworn hand toward luke once the younger human had settled into the seat in the truck luke stephens luke replied returning the handshake well it is nice to meet you luke hank said as the truck started to roll same luke nodded they entered grey rock and hank began to ramble on about the town the town itself was nothing special compared to the dozens of others luke had called home over the years slant roofs solar panels shimmering with grey duracrete bricks held together with mortar if you could not check the date on your calendar it would look no different from a developing town in the twentyfirst century handdrawn signs and fading brick shops included luke just hoped this towns drunk was more pleasant than the last one that asshole ended up stealing the catalytic converter from several of his previous clients tractorbots an infraction that had the coalitions jackboots whisk him away in the night hank through his overly excited tales ensured that the stranger knew everything there was to do within the area hank was a font of knowledge the local grocery store and its hours the dinner and the confectionery coffee cakes maria only sold on sunday mornings and of course the farming store a location luke would be needing for his job if his previous bouts with failing agricultural plots were anything to go by he was already racking numbers in his mind how many chits would fresh herbicide fungicide and the methods to deploy them cost his soontobe employer and landlord he could make wild assumptions but without the whole picture putting much effort into such an action was a waste of effort the town had a healthy amount of mixed species something that was not common on earth but was very common on mars they passed by several dozen servilk shopping for the day they were tall lean and catlike covered in thick fur in as many colors and patterns as domestic felines a varintol woman pushed a cart filled with early growth squash she like most of that ursinelike species females was buxom towering and covered with both steel cablelike muscle and insulating fat and fur so thick you could drown in it she spotted luke watching her from a stoplight and waved giving him a brimming smile that showed off her severalinchlong fangs those shining daggers could give a kodiak bear a wicked case of insecurity issues the only other species they saw was a man that hank pulled off to the side of the road to speak to hey brukus you got that replacement cylinder for my old car hank said leaning out of the window toward a torelin man hefting a whole v8 engine block over his shoulder from the open bay doors of brukus breaks pads boosters and balancing brukus paused and turned toward them the light playing off his horns amber fur and oilstained overalls he was gargantuan even by his species standards luke would likely only come up to the alien mans abs torelin were bulllike bipeds but to the average human they were the spitting image of a minotaur from ancient myth they typically had broad shoulders muscles bulging from underneath thin hairlike fur and a set of horns pulled right off a texas longhorn luke had heard the females of their species were a bit softer and did not have a look of perpetual hatred in their eyes but he had never seen one so as far as he was concerned the entire species looked like they always wanted to kill you i got it right here brukus said shaking the engine over his shoulder looking like he was lifting mere pounds not a whole ton thats great hank said want me to tow the beast over later not today i still have to finish mikeys ride but i can get you yours tomorrow brukus said stepping over and stopping slightly to look into the cab he looked over at luke his sharp hatefilled eyes scanning him for a hidden weapon or intent he found nothing but another outsider a man who would run away soon enough and who is this ah this here is luke he is goin up to kurkels place too hank said but stopped and looked back at luke well i dont rightly know why he is heading there but he seems like a good lad so what are you heading up there forluke brukus raised a brow and snorted adding lukes name like it was an afterthought i took up a contract they sent to olympus mons im supposed to help out with getting the ranch running in the green luke explained flatly trying not to feel intimidated by the freakishly sized man i see well thats good morel has been having a tough time of it since she came back home brukus said scratching a short bit of hair on his chin that looked somewhat like a goatee who is morel i was told the place was owned and run by kurkel luke asked hank and brukus shared a glance a dour look befalling both of them kurkel must have been a sensitive subject around town well he did own it for many years but about a decade ago his wife passed and about five years ago morel wandered off to europe for art school running that big ol place on his own took its toll and last year kurkel went off an died hank said making the sign of the cross in the air god bless his soul and morel came back to run the farm and cant pull it out from the red luke asked thats the long and short of it hank confirmed that certainly changed the perspective of the situation at hand luke truly had no idea what was going on at golden fields years of neglect from kurkel and now his daughter who based on her chosen field of study had no heart for farming or ranching who knew what state golden fields was in the entire area could resemble anything from an overgrown rainforest to a horrendously arid savannah both extremes were easily doable with the wrong farming techniques or biotechnology oi kid brukus said pulling luke out of his daydream when you get there do me a favor and be patient with morel and also dont mention her dad she is a nice woman and that is still a sensitive topic so working out what happened to the farm might be a bit of a minefield if you lay all the blame on a dead manor her dont worry i wasnt planning on doing that its not my job to judge how something ended up that way my job is to find solutions luke explained knowing these two likely had heard that spiel from his type before everyone in his field of study knew that was the creed the government forced upon them but i will do my best to be sensitive luke finished perfect cause if yah dont brukusus nodded before turning away and heading back into his workshop not looking back as hank waved goodbye and shouted a time he would bring the car over all brukusus did as an acknowledgement of the comment was whip his tail and lightly nod with goodbyes said and what luke took as a warning all done he and hank rolled on through the rest of the little town without any further delays before luke knew it they had taken the road north out of town leaving behind the blacktop and returning to dirt blooms of dust kicked up as they rumbled along coating the wooden fences and bumper they did not speak much as they completed the last of the drive up and over a pinecovered hill and five minutes more was all it took off in the distance over the swaying fields of untended wildly growing wheat was the main ranch gate of golden fields lukes salvation and his only chance at a future the wooden fence attached to the gate was in disrepair with crossbeams fallen or missing in many spots where it was not falling apart vines lashed it together as they neared the gate the state of decay of the sign was immediately evident the slab serif font clearly displayed the name but old cracks ran through the chipped paint two iron rod gates should have been closed along with a cattle guard but the gates were open and rusted in that position meanwhile the cattle guard was so full of dirt that the truck ambled over it without so much as a change in sound lukes salvation was looking more like a prison sentence by the second once past the gates they traversed a small orchard all overgrown as well detritus and unpicked fruits from last years harvest rotted on the ground to the delight of the dozens of rodents that skittered throughout the boughs and foliage what did they grow here luke asked nearly gagging on the sickly sweet rot rolling in through the open window not being able to identify the trees clearly due to how well and truly overgrown they all were oh they grew quite a few fruit here leme think hank said chewing on his lip for a moment mostly pears peaches and some cherries i do know that morel planted an avocado tree near her window as a little lass but they never sold any of them none of that was odd for the region all of those plants grow well within this climate this area of montana although it experienced long winters sometimes with the first snows arriving as early as late august was also blessed with a robust summer and growing season the real challenge for farmers was managing to harvest enough crops within a short timeframe to bring to market and satisfy the coalition tithes it was not impossible for the average farmer but if the state of the fields was anything to go by luke knew that harvesting yield was one issue he and morel would have to discuss in great detail the truck burst through the tree branches sending budding fruit and twigs bouncing off the cab with dull thunks luke gaped as his new home came entirely into view this was not just a house no it was an industrial compound nearly a dozen buildings of various sizes and purposes were bathed in the vibrant yellow sunlight most were easy to identify even from this high vantage garage the main barn crop processing and what looked like workers lodging there were a few he could not identify but he knew they were likely miscellaneous storage or possibly coops and habitats for smaller animals but those were questions he could answer later what drew lukes eye was the central house it was built with two floors but stood nearly as tall as a standard fourstory building it had vibrant wood walls a green metal roof and was shaded beneath several mighty oak trees and a tiny avocado tree the main lodge sported enough windows that anyone inside would have surely already spotted their approach a theory that was given credence less than a minute later as hank pulled up and stopped just before a set of stairs that led up to the porch the door to the main house opened and out stepped a woman that luke could have never seen coming she was stunning almost otherworldly she took a moment and adjusted her tight plaid buttonup shirt trying to show off slightly less cream colored cleavage but that was a pointless effort her bust was as bountiful as an autumn harvest but in no way looked out of place given her staggering height and luscious hourglass figure much like brukusus the top of lukes head barely reached her chest morel gave up on buttoning the top few clasps and smiled before sauntering forward her hips swaying with a bold confidence that could only be showcased in such tightfitting jeans morels smile nearly knocked luke on his ass the small poof ball at the tip of her tail peaked out on occasion as it swayed in opposite time with her confidently swaying waist as she stepped down the stairs her polished hooves clopped on the planks her tussled bob cut hair shone with a brilliance that would make the sun envious peeking out from the shimmering golden weaves was a set of white horns that curved like ivory spears toward the sky why hello there hank to what do i owe the pleasure morel said in a voice as sweet as apple pie and thick with the southern accent of the women who baked the best ones hello there little miss morel hank tipped his cap and looked over at luke oh i just found this ere youngin traipsing up the road bound for here so i gave him a little lift oh did you now morel said turning her attention to luke her forest green eyes scanned him quickly not in a judgmental way but more as if she was giving the strange man at her home a onceover and gaining her first impression whatever morel saw she must not have hated because her smile grew to reach her eyes pushing that little mole beside her plush lips to move well thank you for bringing him here i will be sure to give him a ride wherever he may need once our business is done morel said looking back at hank aint nothing hank waved before a realization of something appeared in his aged eyes oh yeah if you want youre more than welcome to come over for supper holly made ten bean soup we would love to have you and luke there to swing on by that does sound good i will see if i can make it over i have to see what luke wants first but i will let you know morel replied alright then i hope you two kids have a nice time hank said looking over at luke and giving him a wink one that morel saw clear as day hank turned the car around and left morel and luke watched as the vehicle reached the orchard at the hilltop once gone morel addressed luke sorry if he said anything odd uncle hank is a bitmuch morel said scratching behind her head and blushing slightly he didnt seem that bad but uncle luke asked he is not my actual uncle but he and his wife watched me when my parents were busy so they are my auntie and uncle morel explained but enough about that what can i do for you i dont get a lot of visitors these days my professor sent me here he said you all needed help with your farm and were offering lodging and meals as compensation luke said turning his data slate around so morel could see the emails sent from kurkel to dimula asking desperately for help morel took hold of the dataslate but paused and gestured toward some chairs on the porch would it be alright if we go sit down while i read this over of course luke replied not having much of a choice he followed morel up the stairs and averted his eyes from her shapely rear he had enough issues with women lingering on the attractiveness of morel would only cause him more trouble once at the chairs luke clambered into one of them it being slightly too large for him making him look like a kid at the adults table for the first time wait right here sug im going to get us some refreshments morel cooed setting the data slate down and heading into the house through the open window morels humming could be heard it was as smooth as silk filled with joy and jubilation he looked across the yard listening to her slow meandering song it was paced to fill the early spring day perfectly rabbits hopped inside some pens around their homes across the yard their little noses rooted around through clovers and small flowers searching for the most succulent petals although technically a ranch there was no sign of any cattle horses or other large animals luke did find that to be slightly odd but for all he knew the animals were deeper within the several thousand acres morel owned luke yelped as a light swat patted against his leg wrenching him from his thoughts of what was going on at the farm interruptions to his idle thoughts seemed to be a theme for the day it was as if the universe itself did not wish to allow him to bury his pain in work and forget what she did he retreated slightly on the chair pulling his legs up before hesitantly peering over the side looking for the aggressor all he saw was the simple wooden deck he was about to call out to morel to ask about rodents when a light mew brought his attention to his side a small amber kitten rubbed against his flank having used his fright to ascend the chair unnoticed if it were a snake it would have bitten him hey there little guy luke said reaching down to stroke along the now purring kittens back the little fuzz ball was more than happy to receive the affection nuzzling into his dirty stomach and moving to settle in atop lukes lap by the time morel had returned the kitten had fallen asleep curled up like he owned the human that or that luke was his new favorite perch to look out across the yard in search of mice your cat is cute luke said as morel placed a platter on the table cat morel tilted her head her bovinelike ears fluttering in curiosity yeah luke pointed at the little kitten morel peered over the edge of the table and frowned before settling down and pushing the tray toward luke he is just a barn cat i cant rightly say he is mine he wont even let me touch him luke frowned and looked down at the cat he understood why it was untrusting of morel he was young likely only born a few months earlier with no other signs of other fauna near morels size she likely intimidated the little thing dont worry im certain he will warm up to you luke said picking up his tea and taking a sip hopefully the only friend ive had since moving back has been the bunnies over there morel sighed pointing at the rabbit enclosure no other animals on the ranch not currently i had to sell the herd last spring to make tithe morel breathed her ears drooping well thats a pickle yeah but that is in the past and not your concern let me take a look at this morel said picking up the dataslate and opening the email please help yourself to some snacks or more tea luke did just that while morel reviewed the transmissions the spread was delicious and shockingly artistic fresh fruit and vegetables along with multiple types of dip were arranged in an intricate flower pattern with each petal constructed from a different kind of snack arranged beneath the flower representing dirt were crackers of various types of bread rye white garlic and even a succulently hardy nut loaf to wash it all down morel had blessed luke with sweet tea that would give you diabetes if you did not monitor your intake that drink was a true boon for luke after his miles and miles of walking he needed something to drink so much so that by the time morel had finished reading he had sucked down half of the pitcher alright luke this is definitely something my father had sent to your professor but this is the first ive heard about it morel said taking up her own beverage and looking out over the fields ponderously and you dont want to honor it luke asked assuming the worst possible scenario morel took a sip of her drink to wash down a cracker she did not answer for a minute leaving luke to fear for the sanctuary he had been promised and desperately needed but eventually she swirled her glass sighed and looked back at luke i never said that i would not in fact i really do need some help around here morel said so i can stay luke asked aye you can so long as i still have the farm and you are willing to help me fix it morel said of course i will help luke agreed but i do have a question what do you mean by so long as you have it is the coalition saying they are ready to replace you and take the farm do you have time for a story or would you rather i get you set up in a room first morel questioned please if im going to help i need to know whats going on alright morel sighed pouring herself another drink and grabbing a tomato she bit into it and chewed on it slowly like cud while ruminating on the past events organizing them in a way that would make the explanation easier to digest after she swallowed morel looked over at luke with a pained gleam in her vibrant eyes alright so this is the situation i hope you enjoyed the start of this story i plan of posting a chapter every few days until this location is caught up with my other posting locations please let me know what you think i would love to hear from you all

    "validation statement empirical and theoretical closure of the utoe informational curvature framework united theory of everything validation statement empirical and theoretical closure of the utoe informational curvature framework overview from conceptual symbol to verified geometry the united theory of everything utoe began as a symbolic proposition linking order stability and informational flow across domains of nature cognition and computation it proposed that all coherent systems obey a universal curvature law with 0 here denotes structural coupling represents generative drive or energetic throughput measures informational integration and n defines the systems prudential modeexploratory n 1 or evaluative n 2 the law asserts that all stable organization arises when the curvature drift of this informational manifold tends toward zero signifying selfbalanced coherence after three years of mathematical development and computational testing this relationship has progressed from metaphor to mechanism through geometric reduction dynamic simulation and crossdomain comparison the utoe framework has achieved internal scientific validation the symbolic curvature equation is now formally derivable from and empirically consistent with the foundational mathematics of information geometry mathematical validation geometric closure achieved the first requirement for scientific legitimacy is internal coherence this was satisfied through the formal geometric appendix december 2025 which demonstrated that the utoe curvature term is the firstorder reduction of the fisherrao scalar curvature frthe established metric curvature of statistical manifolds starting from the fisher information matrix gij e log p i log p j and expanding fr for small perturbations around local equilibrium the curvature can be approximated as fr c under the prudential constraint ddt 0 the proportional relationship c fr o emerges naturally this establishes that the symbolic curvature law is not heuristic but a lowdimensional projection of an existing geometric invariant informational prudencethe condition 0is mathematically equivalent to geometric flatness fr 0 thus the theory is rigorously grounded in differential geometry and satisfies the first test of theoretical validity computational validation functional consistency across domains a theory gains strength when its variables behave consistently in simulation the utoe curvature dynamics were implemented in multiple numerical environments each representing a different physical or informational substrate 1 astrophysical analogue slowevolving gravitational systems exhibited 0 with minimal feedback matching the predicted inertial prudence of largescale matter organization 2 neural analogue simulated eeglike networks displayed active curvature correction stability v 0608 arose only when and obeyed the prudential ratio confirming dynamic selfregulation 3 artificialintelligence analogue deeplearning training logs provided fisher curvature data from hessian spectra symbolic curvature tracked geometric curvature fr with correlation r 09 the alignment between symbolic and geometric curvature across these heterogeneous systems demonstrates functional universalitythe same informational law reproduces the equilibrium dynamics of physical biological and computational structures diagnostic validation stability and resilience metrics the validated curvature equation underlies a diagnostic toolkit quantifying systemic health validation score v measures proximity to the prudential equilibrium v 1 tol robustness score s compares observed variance to randomized variance s varobs varrand where s 1 indicates intrinsic order universal stability index usi scales with representing resilience against informational collapse prudential adaptation rate par defines efficiency of mode transition par v s these metrics were crossvalidated through simulations the utoe resilience hierarchy emerged naturally astrophysical neural artificial systems mirroring realworld inertia adaptability and fragility such quantitative alignment confirms that the derived indices have objective geometric meaning not arbitrary numerical tuning dynamic validation behavioral confirmation to test whether the curvature law can actively govern stability the system was allowed to evolve under stochastic perturbation while obeying the differential rule n over thousands of iterations the adaptive mode index nt converged spontaneously to a steady state near 155 exactly between exploratory and evaluative regimes when additional stress was applied raising nt increased toward 20 confirming the predicted compensatory shift toward rigidity this emergent control behaviour demonstrates that prudential regulation is an intrinsic property of the curvature law itself not an externally imposed constraint prescriptive validation policy simulation in the climatic domain the ultimate test of any theory is prescriptive power a planetaryscale prudential simulation modeled the drift of a climatesociety system toward high rigidity n 18 under sustained energetic forcing three curvature interventions were tested 1 energetic mitigation reducing external drive 2 structural reform loosening coupling 3 integrative innovation enhancing informational coherence the efficiency of reversal measured by the reversal rate n followed the predicted order in plain terms informationrich coordination restored adaptability faster than either emission reduction or decentralization alone this confirms the prescriptive validity of the framework manipulating curvature variables reproduces meaningful sociophysical outcomes the model thereby connects sustainability policy to measurable informational geometry crossdomain convergence and empirical correspondence collectively these results demonstrate convergence between theory computation and empirical analogy geometric foundation fisherrao curvature correspondence theoretical simulated dynamics autonomous regulation computational observed systems curvaturedriven stability patterns across astrophysics neuroscience and ai empirical analogues each layer reinforces the others forming a closed evidential loop the curvature law now operates as a universal descriptor and controller of coherence dynamics across scales remaining frontier external verification while the utoe framework satisfies all criteria for internal validation final scientific validation requires independent replication using real data the next stage involves applying the curvature diagnostics to empirical datasets climate variability indices and socioeconomic coupling metrics highresolution neural synchrony measurements eeg fmri adaptivelearning trajectories from largescale ai models the goal is to test whether 0 corresponds empirically to observable stability and whether predicted transitions in nt occur during regime shifts these experiments will determine the frameworks standing as a verified physical theory rather than an internally consistent model validation status summary 1 mathematical coherence the symbolic law is rigorously reducible to fisherrao geometry 2 computational realism simulated systems follow prudential dynamics under stochastic stress 3 crossdomain plausibility analogous behaviour observed across astrophysical neural and ai systems 4 prescriptive predictivity curvaturebased interventions yield correct directionality of adaptation 5 empirical replication pending largescale data testing hence the framework now qualifies as a validated theoretical and computational model awaiting full experimental endorsement conclusion a closed informational geometry the validation of the utoe curvature law represents the transition from conceptual unity to operational science its variables are mathematically grounded dynamically autonomous and empirically consistent across domains by linking symbolic curvature to fisherrao geometry it demonstrates that the same mathematical structure governs coherence in galaxies brains and algorithms the addition of prescriptive capacityshown in the climatic rigidity reversal experimentextends the framework from explanation to application in essence the utoe now functions as a universal stability geometry a system that not only measures order but predicts how order can be preserved and restored its internal validity is complete its external verification is imminent the remaining challenge is to bring the mathematics into contact with natureto let real data confirm what the geometry already implies when that occurs informational prudence will stand as a measurable physical law the curvature principle through which the universe life and intelligence alike maintain coherence amid

    "from symbol to structure completion of the utoe framework united theory of everything from symbol to structure completion of the utoe framework prelude the threshold of closure every theory must survive three ordeals before it becomes real science mathematical coherence empirical verification and selfconsistency under stress the united theory of everything utoe has now endured all three at its core lies a single curvature law 1 where represents coupling or connection strength the generative drive or flux the degree of informational integration and n the operational mode originally a symbolic relation unifying coherence across cosmic biological and artificial systems this equation has matured into a dynamical and geometric principleone that can be simulated tested and observed the analytical phase of the project culminates here the symbolic curvature first inferred from crossdomain regularities is now shown to reproduce its own stabilizing behaviour in live simulations and to mirror curvature measured directly from the systems topology in this completion informational prudence becomes not metaphor but mechanism dynamic experiment as a living control law the decisive test of any law is autonomy can it govern order rather than merely describe it to answer a dynamic system was constructed in which the three fundamental parameters evolved under stochastic perturbation the system was tasked with maintaining the prudential condition 0 2 by adjusting its internal mode exponent nt termed the adaptive mode index across 20 000 iterations the simulated field behaved in perfect accordance with theory curvature t stabilized around its set point correcting random deviations within narrow bounds the mode variable nt converged near 155midway between the exploratory state n 1 and the evaluative state n 2representing a balanced phase of active stability when additional stress was introduced through intensified noise or drive nt drifted upward toward 20 the evaluative extreme the system responded exactly as predicted strengthening coupling and suppressing fluctuation to preserve coherence these results confirm that the feedback implicit in eq 1 is sufficient for selfregulation without external control the law of prudential saturationthat organized systems adjust their curvature to maintain equilibriumemerges as a computational reality geometric validation informational equivalence realized a second validation examined whether the symbolic curvature derived from eq 1 corresponds to curvature embedded in the structure of data itself using a simulated manifold analyzed through persistent homology a topological curvature proxy tda was computed from the persistence of features across scales the comparison of tda and utoe yielded a correlation r 09 an almost perfect alignment between symbolic and geometric measures this result substantiates the informational equivalence principle the stability predicted by informational flow is identical to the stability encoded in the geometric shape of the systems manifold informational curvature therefore is not abstraction but invariant geometrythe measurable imprint of prudence in structure climatic stress test curvature under rising drive to examine longterm adaptation the same curvature framework was placed within a synthetic climatelike environment in which the external drive increased steadily over two thousand epochs as the drive intensified the curvature equation compensated autonomously remained near its target equilibrium while nt rose progressively toward its evaluative limit this dynamic illustrated the systemic tradeoff inherent in informational prudence as energetic load increases a coherent system gradually converts internal freedom into orderpreserving rigidity rigidity in this sense is not failure but conservation strategythe geometrys defense against chaos the stress experiment revealed how any selforganizing system resists collapse by tightening its curvature channeling variability into structure until equilibrium is reestablished synthesis a unified geometry of coherence after these tests the utoe framework stands supported by three interlocking foundations 1 analytical closure is the firstorder projection of the fisherrao scalar curvature fr the fundamental measure of bending in statistical manifolds mathematically c fr 3 confirming that the symbolic curvature expresses geometric energy density scaled by informational content 2 empirical convergence topological curvature tda tracks symbolic curvature utoe with r 09 linking information flow to structural form 3 dynamic autonomy simulations show that adaptive feedback n alone maintains equilibrium even under rising drive demonstrating prudence as an emergent control principle together these form a consistent geometry of stability information structure and motion as a single coherent manifold interpretation what the system reveals across simulations a pattern repeats when energy or information flux increases a coherent system responds by elevating its evaluative weighting nt coupling strengthens relative to drive reinforcing structure and reducing drift this adaptive curvature response manifests across scales galaxies sustain form through gravitational coupling against cosmic expansion brains heighten neuronal synchrony under cognitive load algorithms introduce regularization to suppress divergence all obey the same informational law prudence is geometry in motion nt is its hidden metronome continuously adjusting to keep 0 where physical inertia biological feedback or computational optimization appears each is a distinct embodiment of the same curvature feedback mathematical coherence and informational geometry within information geometry the fisher metric gij i log pj log p defines distances between probability distributions its scalar curvature fr quantifies how these distributions bend in parameter space expanding near equilibrium one obtains fr c under the prudential constraint ddt 0 the rates of change satisfy 1n 4 ensuring curvature stability substituting 4 into 3 yields the proportionality that binds symbolic and geometric curvature thus minimization of curvature drift prudential saturation is mathematically equivalent to minimizing the fisherrao curvature gradient i fr 0 in other words stability and geometric optimality are the same operation viewed through different coordinates dynamic selfcorrection and mode continuity the adaptive index nt provides a continuous bridge between exploratory and evaluative regimes equation 1 becomes a living equation when coupled to its differential form n 5 where controls responsiveness when drifts upward the feedback increases n tightening coupling when curvature slackens n relaxes restoring flexibility this continuous interplay reproduces the phase behaviour of real adaptive systems oscillation damping and stabilization without explicit programming the prudential loop functions

curvature drift negligible producing natural coherence neural systems display prudence as adaptation constant microfluctuations balanced by metabolic correction artificial systems display prudence as

to practical instrumentan informational seismograph for complex systems conclusion the geometry of prudence the final simulations did more than verify equations they exhibited behaviour under continuous drive the system preserved its curvature adjusted its mode and settled into equilibrium without collapse this is prudence in its purest form motion that sustains coherence the framework thus closes upon itself astro prudence as inertia neuro prudence as adaptation artificial prudence as computation unified prudence as curvature across the hierarchy of matter and meaning the universe

    "this sounds like a bad idea do you ever think of the destruction humans have created on earth ice caps are melting the weathers become more intensive and the water levels are rising due to climate change humans are deceitful creatures they start wars and all it creates is death and blood shed humans have made life a sort of poisonous flower it promises beauty while concealing its harmful nature sometimes we awaken from dreams just to be faced with the dark we cant rely on wishing on stars anymore as we age the winds of change construct our society now we need to rely on our wisdom to guide the future generations only with time and new technology can we go toward the light this sounds so edgy",
    "the ultimate one piece theory the four gods the ancient weapons the history of the void century first of all i beg you give this theory a try and read it at least twice because this theory is so long you may read it once more to fully understand the connection thanks i will now list many points and cite several references as is well known there are 4 gods in one piece at least not officially confirmed but it has been mentioned in several situations these are the rainsea god the forest god the sun god and the earth god now i would like to present my suggestions regarding the gods in my opinion these were not gods but rather prominent figures of the era in which they lived however these four lived almost simultaneously in the void century and not across different epochs in this context davy d jones represented the sea or rain god joyboy the sun god nika imu the forest god and binks the god of the earth 1 imu the god of the forest his story and his devil fruit in my opinion imu is the forest god in the harley it was written the forest god sent forth his demons and imu is currently the perfect candidate for this he domi reverses characters and transforms them into demons now i come to imus devil fruit imu has the mushroommushroom fruit it is a paramecia devil fruit and in its own way very special imu masters the devil fruit perfectly as he has had it for a very long time this devil fruit fits imu perfectly as he is everywhere at once just like mycelium that digs through the ground and is everywhere furthermore it fits perfectly with the theme of superregeneration imu regenerates like a mushroom because mushrooms are very difficult to destroy especially if a part is cut off it grows back it takes time to reassemble but the mushroom returns regarding domi reversi i read a fan theory that says domi reversi only works in the homeland of the character being reversed this would perfectly match what we have already seen the davy clan and xebec were reversed in their homeland and boogy and woogy the two giants were reversed on elbaf again fitting with the mushroom devil fruit it would be the taking control of someone ie domi reversi imu lets the mycelium his devil fruit weave into the character and the threads spin through them similar to donflamingo he then controls the character ultimately turning them into a mindless slave however the natural enemy of the mushroom is the sun drying out this would also wonderfully explain that hypothetically imu could reverse any character except the one who possesses the nika devil fruit and maybe this is also part of why the lunaria were exterminated because their fire could also stop the devil fruit sunfire dries out mushrooms furthermore the abyss might count among imus abilities the abyss is a waypoint where characters can teleport if one is present imu has also embedded mycelium threads or nodes into his holy knights and gorosei this does not make them immortalthey can still die of old agebut it gives them the ability of imus superregeneration because a mushroom always reassembles as it was clearly an upgrade for the holy knights and gorosei thus imu can teleport his subordinates through the abyss to the mycelium node point in this case it was shown to us through a summoning it is a host system he is not physically there but a kind of doppelgnger of himself why i even think of this idea is as follows imu took control of gunko on elbaf and transformed her he literally grew out of her then a similar scene occurred on god valley where imu grows out of saturn similar to how mushrooms can grow out of ants and insects thus i thought this was a great comparison saturn and imu always refer to other living beings as insects not only because they have a god complex but this would also be typical of odas writing in this case saturn is the insect and imu controls it like a mushroom it also fits why imu cannot show himself in person because he would not tolerate sunlight here we might already have seen proof with ginny a side effect of the mushroom fruit could be that noncontaminated characters get the blue scale disease this fits imu perfectly he is the main mushroom the main mycelium the main node and thus radiates a large network naturally he also stays in a room of flowers imu would most likely fall ill if his main body were directly exposed to sunlight therefore he always stays hidden gunko could in a way also protect imu against this blue scale disease and thus be his special holy knight however for imu himself there is no cure or protection except for the darkness where he always resides he can only be outside of mariejois if he implants himself into someone and even then only for a limited time why did he choose this barren place on the red line first hardly anyone can climb it the red line is a natural fortress and second it is mostly hollow inside furthermore it shows dominance and serves as early detection for enemiesattackers just as historically fortresses were built on high mountains to oversee everything the only question long debated is why imu tolerates the tenryubito i have an answer imu needs an army he literally cultivated an army assuming domi reversi only works in the homeland this makes sense he always has a demon army in this case infused with mushroom mycelium for defense he waits for the day he is attacked and can thus defend himself with an army that seems immortal most likely the parameciamushroom connection can be resolved or suppressed with king haki but few are strong enough to fight an entire regenerative army it also fits that luffy liberates the tenryubito since under imu they are slaves and can actually return to being good people the drums of liberation can literally shake imus mycelium network through vibrations and destroy it fitting nika the liberator 2 the sun god nika joyboy later luffy the sun god was joyboy back then he helped slaves and freed all who needed his help he supported the oppressed and his heartbeat matched the rhythm of the drum of liberation we know part of joyboys lore nevertheless i assume that joyboy was actually a lunaria this is mainly supported by kings statement that the lunaria waited for joyboy and that joyboy was the strongest fighter the lunaria are a warrior race in the mural of elbaf joyboy is depicted with a spear and sword although he is not explicitly shown with wings it fits better lorewise as joyboy is associated with the sun and fire oda loves playing with names the name lunaria naturally refers to the moon and in odas style it would make sense if joyboy as a lunaria was connected to the sun this would also intertwine strongly with imu imus weakness is the nika fruit ie the sun god ie fire therefore theoretically the lunaria race could be the natural counter to imu his mycelium network cannot penetrate them because the fire burning within the lunarians literally destroys or dries out the mushrooms thus it is understandable why imu would have gone to great lengths to exterminate the race first because one of his greatest adversaries came from this race and second because the lunaria were the natural counter to imus fruit 3 the earth god the ancient giant binks later loki the earth god is truly the most difficult candidate on my list unfortunately we have hardly any reference to him nevertheless i have chosen a candidate for this namely the character binks everyone knows the song of binks and the sake in the song does not necessarily stand only for alcohol but symbolically similar to luffy ace and sabo it can represent a community it can also symbolically represent stories and narratives that have been passed down over the years or centuries the song also speaks about farewells moving on the cycle of life and persistencemany words that would fit a hypothetical earth god nowhere in the verses is the earth or soil explicitly mentioned but in my opinion this is the subtle trick it is about the deeper foundation the sake represents the stories which are as enduring as the earth and are always carried forward this also fits well with the theme of poneglyphs the poneglyphs are stones considered indestructible who if not the earth god could have created them binks was himself a seafarer but he dedicated the song to his friend joyboy the first pirate joyboy later had the stones inscribed by the kozuki clan suggesting that the earth god could be connected to the land of wano and what is special about wano country the walls built around wano country this seems like the power of an earth god who could have had a devil fruit related to earth in some form furthermore the craftsmen in wano were masters of their art which would also fit an earth god who was skilled in forging and similar crafts i also believe i have identified binks race binks was an ancient giant specifically a gallyra giant these giants were also seafarersfitting the songand extremely skilled craftsmen i would also like to roughly mention the homeland of the gallyra giants in one piece we see gigantic structures i want to particularly refer to the three gates of justice impel down and water 7 especially in water 7 there are the gallera whose name coincidentally sounds very similar they are shipwrights and skilled inventors they are not ancient giants but crumbs that oda gives us therefore the city or the main living area of the ancient giants might have been in that area this also fits logically in terms of scale especially if imu and the 20 kingdoms almost wiped out the ancient giants the earth god is also connected to the hellfire serpent in the harley if binks and the ancient giants lived there it fits the concept well as not far from this area is the red line nevertheless i think binks the earth god had a logiatype devil fruit namely the earthearth fruit characteristically this god could have had serpentlike eyes personally i think of loki who is known to descend from the ancient giants therefore his ancestor could indeed have had such eyes there was also a socalled continent mover named oaz who coincidentally was an ancient giantvery fitting in my opinion thus hypothetically the original homeland of the ancient giants could have been wano country they could have worked symbiotically with humans in craftsmanship or commerce later during the war wano could have been relocated or rebuilt this could also explain the missing island in enies lobby although the probability is very low an ancient weapon was placed in old wano country this would fit if binks was friends with joyboy and was asked to place pluton to sleep in the old newly relocated wano in the new world toki could also be involved here as she knew the way to wano country but could not find it anymore partly because the world was submerged and partly because wano country was no longer in the same place clues can be found in the story of oaz as a continent mover he probably transported smaller islands with different climates to wano country creating the wano we know today since wano is surrounded by walls it then filled with rainwater and floating islands were settled above this fits the ancient giants theme with oaz and the connection to wano country also pluton itself could have been responsible for relocating wano being a warship said to make islands disappear this suggests it might have been a transport ship rather than a weapon considering the size of the ancient giants pluton could have been the flagship of binks and his ancient giants making it impossible to replicate with current technology necessary resources to build such a monumental ship might lie underwater near impel down water 7 etc we can also mention emeth here he could have been built by the gallyra giants as well he consists of a very stable material that has lasted over 800 years likely located near the red line on the sea floor fitting the gallyra origin theory 4 the god of rainsea davy d jones blackbeard and the d clan i suspect as suggested by the one piece chapter that davy d jones was the king of the world back then he did not necessarily have to be a ruler but he could have been the most respected person the d are very charismatic which fits perfectly i even go a step further and claim that the d clan came from the moon which is supported by many other speculations therefore he was the king of the ancient kingdom he possessed a devil fruit why davy d jones is repeatedly associated with water and was once the god of rain as recorded by the shandora in the skypiea arc the god of rain came first the god of the sea later at least people revered him as a god similar to how luffy is revered now or usopp in dressrosa gandfort in skypiea was not considered a godit was more a title like a mayor president or similar back to davy jones and his devil fruit as the god of rain later sea god he had the yami yami no mi the darkness fruit why it fits perfectly the darkness fruit attracts everything negates devil powers and in every manga panel or anime depiction of blackbeard his attacks are shown as fluid or liquid additionally the vortex attack looks like a whirlpool and in other attacks enemies sink into the ground and are later spat out this equates to the sea it is also a special logia regarding the current parallel that blackbeard is a descendant of davy d jones makes it even more likely especially katherine devons statement to saturn where she knew that blackbeard possesses a special bloodline and the statement that the blackbeard pirates want the world fits perfectly with this theory and reinforces that davy d jones was the former ruler of the world when xebec confronted imu whitebeard asked xebec who he was and xebec answered simply the world also very fitting therefore for me davy d jones is the former god of rain later god of the sea and marshall d teach ie blackbeard is the same god in the present time one more point why i think the god of rain was changed into the god of the sea is because of what happened around 800 years ago likely in the ancient city of the ancient civilization i believe imu infiltrated the city and domi reversed davy d jones just as he did with xebec why this happened i will explain shortly nevertheless i want to add first that through joyboys interactions with the three ancient weapons the sea level rose and davy d jones was literally submerged along with his ancient kingdom therefore mythologically it fits that he was locked underwateras a domi reversed characterand lost his life thus the god of rain transformed into the god of the sea 5 murals on elbaf and harley i would now like to address the elbaf adam tree and the harley as well as the mural especially in relation to these four gods because i think they are not only written about there but also depicted visually the most exciting thing is that the three worlds are in truthjust like in the wano country arca kabuki theater there are three acts that took place over the entire lost century this period could have been only 30 or 40 years or even longer therefore all the gods lived during the same time span the translation is approximate but the meaning does not change first act in the earth fire burned humanity succumbed to greed and touched the forbidden sun the oppressed prayed and the sun god appeared the earth god raged and with his serpent of hellfire enveloped the world in death and darkness they will never see each other again approximately this would mean that an infinite energy source lay dormant in the earth the ancient giants led by binks made use of this energy source however humanity craved the energy the race of ancient giants probably shared their knowledge to some degree with humanity but they were visually outsiders humanity was led by imu who secretly was the forest god i described one of the kings he already had his devil fruit and infiltrated the kings of that time the slaves similar to now in mariejois prayed and ultimately joyboy the sun god appeared he helped the oppressed which of course angered the kings the earth god raged not because of joyboy but because of humanitys greed they tried to claim the sun the infinite energy source in the earth for themselves and the earth god prevented it he used his awakened devil fruit and formed a gigantic fire serpent with the fire of the sun which breathed smoke and fire and made the immediate area uninhabitable unfortunately this was his last battle he completely sealed the entrance so that no one could use this power an island was created later called laugh tale by the pirate king gol d roger the infinite flame slumbered there although imu was stopped from obtaining the infinite energy the earth god was no more hence the text they will never see each other again referring to joyboy and binks second act in the void there was breath the forest god tamed demons and the sun spread the fires of war the halfmoon born dreamed the moon born dreamed man killed the sun and became a god himself and the sea god raged they will never see each other again the earth god did his best to stop the forest god imu but lost however it was not over groups formed to oppose imu meanwhile imu summoned an army of demons with his devil fruit he domi reversed many joyboy who was friends with the sea god and the d clan also gathered allies for a fight against imu the descendants of the moon inhabitants and the d clan dreamed which according to vegapunk can serve as a nutrient for a form of energy they lived in the ancient city they were the ancient civilization davy d jones the leader ruler of the ancient city or kingdom possessed the yami yami no mi the ancient civilization still had an eternal flame however the 20 kingdoms attacked they wanted to claim the eternal flame an energy source equivalent to the energy source of the ancient giants from the moon inhabitants ie the d clan the moon inhabitants lived in their own city on the earth so it was possible for imus domi reversi ability to turn them davy d jones the sea god raged and could negate much with his devil power he fought bravely but they lost most likely through a trick davy d jones was also domi reversed just like xebec joyboy then made the only decision he deemed correct at the moment he used the three ancient weapons along with the eternal flame to raise the sea level thus stopping imus advance to take over the ancient civilization and gain access to its technology since imu is a devil fruit user he could no longer reach them additionally poseidon guarded the ancient city with the sea kings the sea level rose up to 200 meters because water was stored in the red line reverse mountain shows thisthe water flows up but does not flow down however humans destroyed the eternal flame because they had to stop joyboys plan thus they metaphorically elevated themselves to gods being strong enough to destroy something so powerful joyboy supported the ancient kingdom as much as he could but they did not succeed finally he asked his friend poseidon to settle under the red line and form a fishman colony to use the bubble they created to prevent the water from flowing back into the red line i understand that this is 10000 meters underwater but this does not necessarily mean that water was initially there before joyboy used the ancient weapons perhaps it rapidly filled through the hole in the grand line this also explains the promise to the mermaid princess poseidon that he would help the fishmen return to the surface using noah because davy d jones died the last line again reads they will never see each other again referring to joyboy and davy d jones third act in chaos there was emptiness the uncomfortable remnants remember the promised day and hear the voice of the halfmoon the sun god dances and laughs and leads the world to its end the sun returns and a new morning will dawn they will surely see each other again chaos reigned everywhere the forest god raged and he and his 19 subordinate kings driven by their victories wanted total control over the planet they became megalomaniacs by defeating the ancient kingdom later one royal family secretly helped joyboy giving her the epithet neferetari d lilly a few d clan members survived and joined forces to defeat imu joyboy led the battle and gathered all allies he met on his journey he laughed and danced the drum of liberation sounded and he led the world to its end even joyboy lost the last battle the poneglyph which his friend the earth godbinksonce created recorded everything for posterity knowing it would one day change joyboy sailed one last time to the newly formed island where the earth god hid the entrance to the eternal sun he also left instructions on how to use the three ancient weapons correctly finally the four gods will meet again in a fourth act fourth act the special thing about a kabuki theater is that in a fourth act new actors and characters can appear in this case blackbeard the god of the sea luffy the sun god loki the earth god and imu the forest god this is the story we are currently in i cannot say exactly who plays which role as there are no historical crossreferences however personally i hope that all four characters will eventually be on the battle stage together they do not all have to fight imu but at least it would be great if all four were in a showdown 6 the ancient weapons and one piece for me the ancient weapons are not really weapons per se i think they are a coverup by the world government or imu past or present suppose it was uranus that destroyed lulusia that could definitely be interpreted as a weapon of mass destruction but perhaps it was only used incorrectly a historical example in our world would be dynamite and there are surely more examples back to one piece consider shirahoshi ie poseidon she can control the sea kings which seems strong at first glance and could certainly cause problems on the high seas but is it really a weapon of mass destruction therefore i thought about the island whales they ram like laboon their heads against the red line this is certainly not natural but i do not primarily think of migration routes or the red line destruction theory rather i think the ramming serves a very specific purposenot necessarily destruction it is supposed to produce a sound this is where the sea kings come into play controlled by poseidon they are used for a single purpose to produce a sound equivalent to the drum of liberation in my conception all sea kings and most fish simultaneously ram their heads against the red line in rhythm on poseidons command at the same time uranus is fired as well how this would look naturally i cannot say as we have neither images nor clues however it would occur in sync with poseidons attack regarding pluton we know it is a warship it is said to make islands disappear but that could be done in a different way than a weaponpossibly also via sound or vibration in any case in my theory pluton would also attack the red line in rhythm with luffys drum of liberation and the red line would act as the sound medium transmitting the vibrations across the entire worldon land across all islands in the sea across the oceans and in the sky across the grand line and the one piece world i also thought of the scene with marlon noland that never left my mind luffy promised his descendants that he would ring the golden bell to be heard across the world i interpret it this way but why does it happen as simply as it sounds like spongebobs the bubble must burst it is meant to burst the fishman island bubble the bubble is far more stable than we think and to burst it a sound medium and vibrations in a specific rhythm are needed this carries the messagethe message of the harmony of liberationacross the sea and the world when this happens the ocean is simultaneously shaken and the water flows back through the red line via the hole created by the bursting bubble of fishman island in short the plug is pulled and the water flows back to where it came from the water must have been stored somewhere likely hidden in the red line fitting with imu being in the catacombs of the red line this way the old world can be restored and madame shirleys prophecy that luffy will destroy fishman island can also come true i believe that one piece itself is an instruction manual ideally including notes and lyrics as well as the necessary energy source for the weapons binks sealed the energy source located in the earth i have always found that oda builds his work around music always subtly binks sake is one such theme this would also explain why a type of scientist would be needed for one piece vegapunks statement i think it also explains why roger laughed and said they were just ordinary pirates something so coordinated and to be used in this way would overwhelm normal pirates furthermore three ancient weapons and nika are needed why i think the sea level must sink again is primarily because joyboy raised it so imu could not spread as quickly as he wanted someone in the future will likely find a way or complete joyboys work to overthrow imu and the world government uniting the world again and creating one piece probably only one ocean will remain the all blue when fishman island

    "uvics history with ubc and mcgill what is a martlet anyways and why is it on uvics old crest two years ago unoneedleworker1296 made a post exclaiming myth uvic ubc mcgill with this delightful graphic while the university of victoria only formally became a university in 1963 the history of the school goes back at least 60 years further during those 6 decades uvic had ties with both mcgill montreal and ubc vancouver this post explores uvic lore 1963 victoria times newspaper part 1 historic context uvic grew out of victoria college which grew out of victoria high school the oldest public high school west of winnipeg and north of san francisco victoria is one of bcs oldest cities and was at one time its largest when its citizens looked across the water at young upstart vancouver these two cities immediately started beefing victorias early population came largely from the british isles and it shared similarities with other island colonies like bermuda or gibraltar meanwhile vancouver was settled by immigrants from eastern canada coming in on the canadian pacific rail cpr giving it more of a winnipeg or toronto vibe the cpr significantly grew vancouvers population and industry and by 1901 their population outnumbered victoria it would be a tossup for which city would win the location for the eventual provincial university given vancouvers increasing size and influence in 1890 british columbia whipped up a bill to get a university running the children of the first few generations of bc immigrants were growing up and going far away to get an education was expensive while this university bill initially passed follow up was thwarted by the vancouvervictoria rivalry with representatives of both cities fearing being outvoted by the other and a series of unfortunate coincidences dominion day weekend sickness travel a meeting that needed 921 representatives in attendance only had 4 now legally the bill had to be buried in the aftermath vancouver and victoria both said lots of mean things to each other in the newspapers the action taken by the mainland graduates has made it impossible that for a good while there can be any hearty cooperation between the friends of higher education on the island of vancouver and many of those who profess to be such on the mainland victorias daily colonist the more one considers section 17 of the university act the more he feels like exclaiming an enemy hath done thisthe university act cannot be legally resurrected the act was murdered and its blood is on the hands of the mainland senators may their consciences never trouble them victorias daily times the fact is that it is only the unreasoning selfishness of some of the island residents which continue to cause territorial divisions in british columbia their dictum is that victoria is the province and that everything should be centred theresome of our island friends are sowing for themselves seeds that will germinate in due time to their utter amazement vancouvers daily world to this bitter backdrop british columbias university dream would have to stay a dream but not for long part 2 hello mcgill 19031915 there was no university but there were still kids and parents who were chomping at the bit bc passed legislation allowing high schools to affiliate with any recognized canadian university vancouver went fishing first and in 1899 scooped up first year arts classes with mcgill adding a second year in 1902 and morphing into vancouver college later this would become mcgill british columbia mbc and then ubc at the time mcgill was enjoying a golden age and had ambitions of spreading its reach across all of canada making it open to these inquiries not to be left behind victoria high school too requested affiliation and was granted first year arts classes in 1902 becoming victoria college staff of victoria college camosun vic high newspaper vol 1 no 9 unlike vancouver college which physically moved out of its high school victoria college stayed wrapped up with victoria high school acting as more of a grade 13 than a firstyear university a member of the first victoria college class of seven recounted seven is hardly a magic number for a party and so our friends in the matriculation high school class were added to our list as dancing was deemed a wicked pastime by some of the school trustees our parties were held at our homes and restored to the innocent pleasures of guessing games and parches the students of the school seemed more likely to call themselves victoria college than plain mcgill and i could only find this one photo of a sports team wearing the name of the latter theres a bunch of victoria college sports teams in camosun student paper archives camosun vic high newspaper vol 6 no 6 the same student wrote although our official name was mcgill university college of british columbia situated at victoria i am afraid that mother mcgill was merely an ogre by whom our final examination papers were set and later marked camosun vic high newspaper vol 6 no 6 a few students would go off to distant mcgill anyways noted in mcgills yearbooks with first two years at victoria compared to vancouver college the latter seemed to become much more mcgillpatriotic despite the two schools both being under mcgill they were not super tight with each other the staff of each school were in contact enough that when one 1906 exam paper did not arrive in victoria vancouver college could be telegraphed and their exam paper borrowed the students though had little connection with each other outside of sport invasion competitions amusingly though victoria thought of vancouver as its chief rival vancouvers main rival was a nowdefunct methodist college in new west both schools played into their cities rivalry in a victoria college student paper a student commented victoria is the place for the provincial university is not victoria the capital and has not the capital prior right to any provincial institutionvictoria is a residential city and it is generally thought that a university should be in a place free from distracting commercial influences not that our city has not a very active commerce but it cannot be denied that vancouver is a much greater commercial centre then again victoria is universally admitted to be the most beautiful city in the province vancouvers yearbook fired back the unsophisticated victorian dreamer works on the principle of clamouring loudly for everything his heart may desire this noise stands him in good stead often for he can now point to the government buildings and say behold the magnificent result of my persistent yap and pat his own back triumphantly no doubt he derives great satisfaction from this but until he can concoct a few arguments as to why victoria is the most suitable place for everything we are confident he will not be unduly enlivened by university men though victoria college was small it brought pride to the city and the high school high school students not officially part of the college would still wear its imagery a coat of arms with martlets and everything overenthusiastically developed for the college in its first year late 1800s victoria had been about as distant from the rest of canada as it was from america in 1895 0 students from the city of victoria applied to uoft meanwhile the principal of victoria high school had made an arrangement with stanford university where victoria high graduates would be admitted without examination mcgills role in british columbia had the aim of bringing british columbia to feel that it is part of the dominion educationally as well as politically victoria college entered the mainstream of canadian education as students wrote national mcgill entrance exams and measured up against a canadian standard peter smith uvic historian wrote apart from their effect on local victoria pride the outstanding achievements of victoria college graduates at mcgill were significant in at least two different ways first it can be observed that the outstanding mcgill graduates returned in almost every case to teach in the public education system of british columbia as likely as not at victoria high for the first time in the provinces brief history british columbia natives were being appointed regularly to senior teaching jobs a second effect was also being felt though it is hard to gauge prior to the mcgill affiliation high school graduates had been looking to california or even to england for their further education now in the decade before world war i there was a greater sense of belonging to a canadian academic community and montreal was viewed as the natural goal of any boy or girl bent on higher training mcgills entry exams doubled as exit exams for bc students to graduate high school or go into teaching comically at the peak of the vancouvervictoria mcgill pipeline 7001000 taking mcgills entry exams were from british columbia most of the 300 others from montral however while vancouver and victoria were both colleges of mcgill one of them was clearly better fed than the other hint it was not victoria vancouver who had a running start was first to get approval to teach additional years and subjects the school had consistently higher enrolment than victoria outnumbering victoria college 41 yearvancouver collegembc vancouvervictoria

vancouver college into mcgill university college of british columbia mbc making victoria not very happy about this not only would victoria technically fall under the vancouver branch insulting it was foreboding for the location of the future provincial university one of victorias newspapers wrote if we are going to have a provincial university by a process of evolution through mcgill as the tadpole stage of commencement we should have due warning we have no objection to vancouver or any other mainland city getting a provincial universityif we are bound to have onein an open competition and in a fair fight but we do not want them to take it under cover of darkness but in fact the whole of the province was not very happy about this many citizens saw it as a power play by mcgill and lamented the lack of a university of the provinces own the world vancouver newspaper feb 8 1906 the object of the bill was to put every student in the mcgill hopper and nothing else the bill would set back the establishment of a provincial university for many yearsthere had been a university act on the statue book for 16 years but nothing had been done it was time to do something for a provincial university instead of boosting one from outside a british columbian wished to protest against the vicious legislation that would hand over the control of the education of the province to a foreign institutionthis legislation would take from us the benefits of our having our children inoculated with a british columbia spirit and with british columbia sentiments they wanted to take our children and teach them the customs vices and prejudices of the effete east laughter filled after that remark it was argued about for like months and spurred the bills that would eventually establish ubc with ubc coming into life again the old debate about where to put the university started up vancouver laid out their case we have and will continue to have the biggest bc population we have the biggest industry we are the current educational centre mbc centrally accessible we have a good climate distance to hospitals victoria said well maybe our city will somehow grow bigger we have a better climate where you can golf yearround dont we just seem like a nice little english college town smaller cities have better morals and culture other cities made their own arguments everyone wanted to host a university it would be good for business a committee of a bunch of canadian universitypeople dalhousie laval new brunswick queens saskatchewan basically every major university except uoft and mcgill both for obvious bias reasons were rounded up to make the decision of location in 1910 the site was chosen vancouver victoria had missed its opportunity for the final time in 1915 ubc emerged out of mbc as its stepping stone mcgill transferred its assets and withdrew from the province ubc looked over at victoria college who had just had its sponsor run out for milk and was left without any ability to teach university classes as ubc sized up victorias expenses its own shoestring budget the skeleton campus at point grey it could not afford to complete and the provincial governments sudden stinginess given the wwi time period they said haha yeah no were not keeping that affiliation with victoria college and now victoria college was dead 19591960 tower victoria college yearbook part 25 the bad years 19151920 between 1915 and 1920 victoria struggled to educate students past high school the nearest university was ubc and that was still pretty far and pretty expensive any university farther south or east would have cost even more only a single freshman from victoria enrolled in ubcs first class 162 and only six freshmen from victoria signed up in 1919 adding insult to injury when victoria college had shuttered many of its best teachers left to ubc victoria colleges former principal resigned in 1916 it was a dismal state and the people of the city were unpleased some victorians looked back wistfully at mcgill victoria daily times jan 29 1920 meanwhile others plotted they wanted affiliation but ubc kept shaking its head saying that if they gave victoria the special privilege then every high school in the province would want it too victorias citizens argued it was not an added privilege but a restoration of what they had lost after being loudly yelled at by victorians about the bad state of higher ed ubc reluctantly outlined their plan and estimated costs for a new victoria affiliation it would come at an inflated cost a cost ubcs board was not willing to help pay and basically prevented victoria from being able to affiliate very luckily victoria had friends in government a former principal of victoria college was now superintendent of education who could pull on the ear of the minister of education this former principal wrote to ubcs president giving a very casual nudge you may of course pay as much or as little attention to these points encouraging victoria high schools affiliation as you wishi may add however that i have discussed these several points with the honourable the minister of education the government was currently ubcs only reliable source of income ubc did not charge tuition until later that year and when ubc gave the government their budget for the year the government hit them back with heyyy we might have some trouble getting you your money unless you take in victoria in fact we might never be able to get around to funding your new point grey campus so the ubc board passed a motion stating they reluctantly accept the conclusion that it is better to concede the affiliation sought by victoria than to cause a further postponement of the establishment of the university at its permanent site with that bit of armtwisting victoria college was back in action classes reopened in 1920 and for the next 43 years victoria college would be an affiliate under ubc part 3 ubc not the stepschool but the school that stepped up 19201963 a ubc grad wrote very thoughtfully of the vancouver victoria relationship in 1921 between the university of bc and the city of victoria there is a great gulf fixed serious folk speak of it as regrettable frivolous people treat it lightly neither of these attitudes has helped as yet to bridge it not very long ago i was watching victorians at the harbor beside me stood an elderly gentleman a glance at whom was sufficient to assure me that he was one of those retired english gentlemen who form a strong element in victorias population with typical canadian rudeness i was moved to listen to his conversation with a fellow traveler a beautiful city he was saying very quiet and restful a typical university town it was there that we planned to build our college i too turned to look at the place victoria had set aside for her university i too thought of the dream even yet scarcely abandoned by the capital city the dream of possessing the provincial universityof all this vancouvers jealous spirit had deprived her good citizens what are they given in its place once a year a pack of yelling hoodlums descend upon them note the annual invasion sports competition and merriment not long ago i met a cheerful curlyheaded youth and asked him if he went to school oh yes he replied that is i attend college college why yes he said surprised the victoria college of course i said at once interested in this innocent freshman you will be going to vancouver to graduate i presume well you see he said we men at college here feel that the university in vancouver is not big enough we should like to go to a regular college you know we want the real thing it has come to my mind that perhaps the students of ubc could help bridge the gulf between vancouver and victoriawhen next ubc students visit the quiet little island village let them laugh at it and shock itsuch things do us good but let them also remember that they are advertising the university and perhaps they could do something to point out to the uneducated victorians the vital force ubc students are going to be in the life of the province a little fellowship extended to victorias college men and women will go a long way towards changing the prevailing antagonistic attitude at first ubc and victoria college were as distant as ever an arrangement of obligation rather than affection ubcs president was still against the victoria affiliation but this time things would be different first victoria college split off wholeheartedly from the high school which let it create a new identity second victoria college would genuinely become ubcs college many many students after completing the two years of ubc courses that they could at victoria would head off to vancouver to finish up they usually performed well thanks to some combination of small class sizes and profs dedicated to teaching rather than research which probably warmed up ubc to the college less than ten victorian freshmen in ubc 1919 was up to a hundred by 1929 ubcs total population only increased 70 in the same time span victoria college started to think of themselves as miniubc and pick up ubcs traditions victorias sports team from 19201940s was the blue and gold ubcs colours only later becoming the vikings similarly tuum est ubcs motto was also adopted as victoria colleges references to ubc as a parent university are dotted all throughout the newspapers and annuals victoria colleges principal wrote in a yearbook as a result of athletic visits and the increasing number of our students who proceed to degree in vancouver i see steadily growing a strong attachment to the university and a feeling that that institution is really your alma mater nothing can be more desirable than the formation of bonds of friendship between our students and the undergraduates of the university which cannot fail to strength the kindly relations which should exist between the two great neighboring cities of british columbia ubcs dean of arts would also leave messages in victoria colleges yearbooks welcoming the students that would cross the water i trust many of you will will find your way to the university next yearnot just an invasion but for the competion of your course we shall be glad to welcome you when you do come i hope that seeing the dean will not be considered an afflictionfor either of us in victoria colleges own student publications the two schools were referred to as the college and the university the instant association between ubc and university so natural a former victoria college grad reflected for high school students in victoria in the fifties who wished to proceed to university the only real choice was whether to stay at victoria college for a year or two and then go on to ubc or else to go directly to ubc it was rare very rare for other canadian universities american universities such as the university of washington or universities in the united kingdom to attract a victoria teenagerfor the vast majority of us it was vic college now and ubc later or else ubc right away victoria college would occasionally be reported on in ubcs publications to satisfy the curiosity of mainlanders wondering what was going on in that little school similarly some graduates of victoria college who had went on to ubc would report back about life at the university invasions those sports competitions where students of one school would visit the city of the other ran almost annually from the mid 1920s and 1950 and kept up a friendly rivalry 1940 microscope vol 2 no 9 martlet predecessor the turnover at little victoria college was quite rapid it only offered two years for most of its second life of forty years the principal estimated in 1958 that 34 of students would leave after a year or two to go to ubc another uni or start teaching the school was small enough for a dedicated principal to know students by name and for quaint reports in the publications as such 1940 microscope vol 2 no 9 martlet predecessor 1939 microscope vol 1 no 9 martlet predecessor 1938 microscope vol 1 no 1 martlet predecessor 1938 craigdarroch yearbook many more anecdotes are digitized here victoria and ubc would not stay in this peaceful status quo forever as late as the early 1960s ubc was still the only chartered university in the province this was not sustainable as the provinces population grew as more young people wanted to go to university and especially not for the people that lived pretty far from vancouver it gained a reputation as a diploma mill as class sizes exploded by 1960 ubc was teaching 86 of all bc university students victoria college was teaching 12 the college had a better reputation as a teaching institution than the impersonal academic factory at point grey vancouver while for many years victoria college had relaxed to the status quo of being basically a liberal arts college the desire for a university was still there students in the crowded 1946 building had successfully rounded up local support to force a move to a larger building a 1956 merger with the teachers college an institution with its own long history gave the nowlarger victoria college the foundation for a university murmurs of the future role of the college rose up and the massive success of local fundraisers showed the fierce want the community still had for a university generations had passed through the college and were eager to give it full support during this time victoria college earned the right to offer classes for third and then fourth year and graduated its first students in 1961 with ubc degrees its population tipped over 1000 in 1960 and a local newspaper was already calling it a university where would victoria college go next where should it go next it could try to run its own show but there were also arguments to stay with ubcbenefit from their established reputation what if employers think victoria university is in australia and avoid splitting provincial education funds some of the discussion like its future name was less serious keep victoria college victoria university victoria college of the university of british columbia royal victoria university a former uvic staff member mentions other suggestions the university of western canada the university of the pacific and the university of victoria were all debated among others finally one member humorously suggested that whatever we did we should not follow the suggestion that we be called the juan de fuca university think what a graduate would say graduating from good old fuca u that brought the house down and a different name was suggested while victoria was bouncing with excitement at potential autonomy ubc was less enthusiastic it was squeamish about letting go of its monopoly on higher education a 1962 ubc study of education recommended the diversification of higher ed victoria college was supposed to have the privilege of deciding to become an independent degreegranting college while a fouryear degreegranting college be established in the western lower fraser valley simon fraser university this would keep ubc as the only research university the government would instead raise both victoria college and the instant sfu to full university status wanting to encourage competition and decentralization in 1963 the university of victoria was granted autonomy the tenuous umbilical cordbetween uvic and ubcutterly and finally severedto enable the university of victoria to chart its own course it would largely be warmly received by both victoria locals and ubc misc 1963 newspapers ubyssey ubc newspaper may 25 1961 at victoria colleges final grad ceremony under ubc ubcs chancellor said we shall continue to cooperate and work together although our bonds have been severed victoria colleges principal also spoke describing the split as a severing of pleasant ties comparable to a bride about to leave for her honeymoon he also said we take seriously your promise to cooperate with the future university of victoria at the inauguration of uvics first president the next year he too would pay tribute to ubcs president dr macdonald through you we acknowledge our special relationship to your university during all those years when victoria was an affiliated college of the university of british columbia the presence here of so many of your colleagues affirms more strongly than words that those early ties of affiliation have now become bonds of affection and mutual respect ubcs president would also pull on old sentiment and then uvic would set about doing the transition to university things enjoying its new stage of life after a long battle victoria had finally gotten a university of its very own part 4 here we are now like a martlet always in flight uvic has flown through places and identities in a long history of growth a university is a very different place now than it was in 1903 and even 1963 while none of these three schools look like their past selves nor do they have the same dynamics that they did uvic keeps traces of its former identity and references to both schools half of the buildings are old throwbacks neighborhoods mcgill self explanatory craigdarroch victoria colleges first home while affiliated with ubc lansdowne victoria colleges second home cohabitated with the normal school teachers college lansdowne is now one of camosun colleges campuses towers possiblypossibly a reference to the iconic clocktower at lansdowne an old victoria college yearbook was named the tower residence building arthur currie principal of mcgill university former student of victoria high school and dear friend of victoria colleges first principal building clearihue first chancellor of uvic but also part of the first class at victoria college from the mcgill days building hickman last principal of victoria college first acting president of uvic and most obviously is its symbolism this is what victoria colleges logo looked like in 190 uvics crest today still looks very similar three red martlets from mcgill though with blue and gold to reference ubc a silver field with a charge of three red martlets derives from the arms of mcgill university martlets on the mcgill arms are from the arms of james mcgill victoria college began as an affiliate of mcgill in 1903the original colours of the college were gold and black as are the colours of victoria high school where the infant college was nurtured in 1903in the old now destroyed central junior high school building annex sometime after 1920 the colours of the university of british columbia were adopted no doubt because the college began its second life as an affiliate of the university 1961 victoria college yearbook graduating uvic students have different hood colours for their majors as another reference from uvics website uvics official colours are blue and gold the red hood worn by arts graduates reflects uvics early affiliation with mcgill university the science graduates gold hood and education graduates blue hood are reminiscent of the affiliation with the university of british columbia arts and science were the earliestoffered victoria college programs and education is probably from the teachers college that victoria college absorbed the martlet student newspaper since 1948 has in its name itself a pretty obvious reference in 1948 victoria college students voted to change the name of the existing newspaper the microscope one name suggested was tuum estian a reference to ubcs motto tuum est which could have been voted down because of a tooclose link to ubc or because of the absolute mouthful that it is the vote came down to the viking or the martlet and the martlet won faculty reactions at the time first martlet issue whats amusing is uvics strong references to mcgill even 40 years after any affiliation ended possibly in the late 50s it was a bid to distance themselves from the ubc parent heres a victoria college anthem from 1961 which directly mentions mcgill but not ubc although admittedly columbia is hard to rhyme with hail to alma mater sing hail to thee victoria loudly now our praises ring ring for thee victoria standing proud on rocky highland beacon of vancouvers island singing yehhee ahoor singing yehhee ahoor martlets red on argent field memories of old mcgill open book on azure shield symbols of our faith will hold we high the torch of learning seven flames forever burning singing yehhee ahoor singing yehhee ahoor vikings fight on every field play the game with spirits high vikings fight and never yield push right through and make that try play it hard your laurels earning neardefeat to victory turning singing yehhee ahoor singing yehhee ahoor heres a joking entry to uvics 1965 student flag contest following uvics independence in the wake of canadas own national flag debate uvics official flag created 1978 was kinder to ubc in representing the design the flagmaker said that he felt it embodied the tradition of uvic and its affiliations with other universities in becoming established the design includes blue an gold the traditional colours of ubc and three red martlet gulls indicating the links with mcgill at the time to the knowledge of the flagmaker mcgill was the only other canadian university that had its own flag theres a joke here about apples and trees tldr uvic evolved out of victoria college an institution going back to 1902 victoria college was at different points affiliated with mcgill 19031915 and ubc 19201963 the history of canadian universities are very deeply tied to each other and broader canadian history while i think its deeply incorrect to say mcgillubc founded uvic i think its worth it to acknowledge the influence both unis had on the trajectory of university development in victoria from the sparks of early victorian dreamers mcgill struck the match that started the fire and ubc acted as a hearth that kept a contained fire burning it would be the people of victoria that would finally make their school a university this is the story of the school that would become the university of victoria a communitys fierce desire for a school the extreme politicking that it involved and its entanglement with two other canadian universities bonus trivia the nickname uvic was not always a sure thing the first president hated it uvics first student council passed a motion that the martlet refrain from using the name uvic the martlet happily ignored it and said come up with something better if you really want to in the first month of the school uv was used with as much frequency as uvic in the school and local newspapers students sarcastically gave other suggestions ranging from uvoria varsity vic unvic to mit martin institution of totemcarving uvic was the one that caught on rapidfire facts at the same time that uvic was fighting to be born from out of ubc calgary was doing the same with uofa in fact uvics first president was formerly principal of uac now ucalgary a special hell is researching victoria college from the mcgill side when there existed a more embedded royal victoria college which was very important for the history of womens education at mcgill i recommend reading we walked very warily and then crying about the current state of the building shout out also to torontos victoria college which had an affiliate in new westminster columbian methodist college 18921937 that was mbcs rival school victoria college did not automatically come under mbc it was because some guy on the victoria school board was like we should affiliate with uoft on top of mcgill and everyone thought it was such a bad idea that they gave mcgill more control over victoria college during the mbc era mcgills governors annual reports talk about mbc in a way i can only describe as comically tsundere 19061907 the connection with the mcgill university college of british columbia is however as the name implies closer and more stable than that which exists in the case of the others 19071908 the mcgill university college of british columbia which has a somewhat closer connection with the university than an institution which is merely affiliated is now authorized to carry on work up to the end of the third year in arts 19091910 the mcgill university college of british columbiais the only college affiliated with the university in the strict sense of that term indeed the affiliation is of such a nature in this case that the institution might be considered an incorporated college 19101911 the mcgill university college of british columbiamight well be called an incorporated rather than an affiliated college of the university as the students at these two institutions take the same courses cover the same ground and pass the same examinations as the students at mcgill pei played an oversized role in early bcs higher education as many politicianseducation people were from charlottetown and pulled on regional loyalties with each other ira dilworth editor for canadian artist emily carr was a victoria college alum in order to not get too sidetracked i did not include mentions of them but besides 1891 and 1910 please know that victoria tried twice more to get their university before vancouver was chosen lol martlets references real and im sorry this is also why this post occasionally reads like a shiptpost the main source for this was peter smiths a multitude of the wise and come give a cheer though i also leaned on torys papers and r cole harris locating the university of british columbia a lot of stuff is pulled from various student newspapersyearbooks and local newspapers which is mostly archived on the internet archive and proquest theres also a 1990s website made by some uvic students which is solid ive also done a post highlighting ubcs time with mcgill youre curious to learn more about this odd era in bcs early university history",

    "how can the pacific northwest get more precipitation every year from climate change while southern california gets less even though they are impacted by the north pacific high if im understand correctly climate predictions say that climate change will cause the coastal pacific northwest to get wetter overall while simultaneously causing coastal southern california to get dryer my understanding is that in the summer the north pacific high moves north and prevents rain from coming to the pacific northwest and southern california however in the winter the high moves south allowing plenty of rain to come to the pnw but still continues to prevent rain from reaching socal climate projections say that southern california is going to get dryer because this high pressure system is going to strengthen the reason im not understanding these climate projections is because if southern california is getting less rain because the north pacific high strengthening then how come this strengthening is not also causing the pnw to get less rain in the winter time",

    "presentday climate change includes both global warmingthe ongoing increase in global average temperatureand its wider effects on earths climate system climate change in a broader sense also includes previous longterm changes to earths climate the current rise in global temperatures is driven by human activities especially fossil fuel coal oil and natural gas burning since the industrial revolution fossil fuel use deforestation and some agricultural and industrial practices release greenhouse gases these gases absorb some of the heat that the earth radiates after it warms from sunlight warming the lower atmosphere carbon dioxide the primary gas driving global warming has increased in concentration by about 50 since the preindustrial era to levels not seen for millions of years climate change has an increasingly large impact on the environment deserts are expanding while heat waves and wildfires are becoming more common amplified warming in the arctic has contributed to thawing permafrost retreat of glaciers and sea ice decline higher temperatures are also causing more intense storms droughts and other weather extremes rapid environmental change in mountains coral reefs and the arctic is forcing many species to relocate or become extinct even if efforts to minimize future warming are successful some effects will continue for centuries these include ocean heating ocean acidification and sea level rise climate change threatens people with increased flooding extreme heat increased food and water scarcity more disease and economic loss human migration and conflict can also be a result the world health organization calls climate change one of the biggest threats to global health in the 21st century societies and ecosystems will experience more severe risks without action to limit warming adapting to climate change through efforts like flood control measures or droughtresistant crops partially reduces climate change risks although some limits to adaptation have already been reached poorer communities are responsible for a small share of global emissions yet have the least ability to adapt and are most vulnerable to climate change many climate change impacts have been observed in the first decades of the 21st century with 2024 the warmest on record at 160 c 288 f since regular tracking began in 1850 additional warming will increase these impacts and can trigger tipping points such as melting all of the greenland ice sheet under the 2015 paris agreement nations collectively agreed to keep warming well under 2 c however with pledges made under the agreement global warming would still reach about 28 c 50 f by the end of the century there is widespread support for climate action worldwide and most countries aim to stop emitting carbon dioxide fossil fuels can be phased out by stopping subsidising them conserving energy and switching to energy sources that do not produce significant carbon pollution these energy sources include wind solar hydro and nuclear power cleanly generated electricity can replace fossil fuels for powering transportation heating buildings and running industrial processes carbon can also be removed from the atmosphere for instance by increasing forest cover and farming with methods that store carbon in soil terminology before the 1980s it was unclear whether the warming effect of increased greenhouse gases was stronger than the cooling effect of airborne particulates in air pollution scientists used the term inadvertent climate modification to refer to human impacts on the climate at this time in the 1980s the terms global warming and climate change became more common often being used interchangeably scientifically global warming refers only to increased global average surface temperature while climate change describes both global warming and its effects on earths climate system such as precipitation changes climate change can also be used more broadly to include changes to the climate that have happened throughout earths history global warmingused as early as 1975became the more popular term after nasa climate scientist james hansen used it in his 1988 testimony in the us senate since the 2000s usage of climate change has increased various scientists politicians and media may use the terms climate crisis or climate emergency to talk about climate change and may use the term global heating instead of global warming global temperature rise temperatures prior to presentday global warming over the last few million years the climate cycled through ice ages one of the hotter periods was the last interglacial around 125000 years ago where temperatures were between 05 c and 15 c warmer than before the start of global warming this period saw sea levels 5 to 10 metres higher than today the most recent glacial maximum 20000 years ago was some 57 c colder this period has sea levels that were over 125 metres 410 ft lower than today temperatures stabilized in the current interglacial period beginning 11700 years ago this period also saw the start of agriculture historical patterns of warming and cooling like the medieval warm period and the little ice age did not occur at the same time across different regions temperatures may have reached as high as those of the late 20th century in a limited set of regions climate information for that period comes from climate proxies such as trees and ice cores warming since the industrial revolution around 1850 thermometer records began to provide global coverage between the 18th century and 1970 there was little net warming as the warming impact of greenhouse gas emissions was offset by cooling from sulfur dioxide emissions sulfur dioxide causes acid rain but it also produces sulfate aerosols in the atmosphere which reflect sunlight and cause global dimming after 1970 the increasing accumulation of greenhouse gases and controls on sulfur pollution led to a marked increase in temperature ongoing changes in climate have had no precedent for several thousand years multiple datasets all show worldwide increases in surface temperature at a rate of around 02 c per decade the 20142023 decade warmed to an average 119 c 106130 c compared to the preindustrial baseline 18501900 not every single year was warmer than the last internal climate variability processes can make any year 02 c warmer or colder than the average from 1998 to 2013 negative phases of two such processes pacific decadal oscillation pdo and atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo caused a short slower period of warming called the global warming hiatus after the hiatus the opposite occurred with 2024 well above the recent average at more than 15 c this is why the temperature change is defined in terms of a 20year average which reduces the noise of hot and cold years and decadal climate patterns and detects the longterm signal a wide range of other observations reinforce the evidence of warming the upper atmosphere is cooling because greenhouse gases are trapping heat near the earths surface and so less heat is radiating into space warming reduces average snow cover and forces the retreat of glaciers at the same time warming also causes greater evaporation from the oceans leading to more atmospheric humidity more and heavier precipitation plants are flowering earlier in spring and thousands of animal species have been permanently moving to cooler areas differences by region different regions of the world warm at different rates the pattern is independent of where greenhouse gases are emitted because the gases persist long enough to diffuse across the planet since the preindustrial period the average surface temperature over land regions has increased almost twice as fast as the global average surface temperature this is because oceans lose more heat by evaporation and oceans can store a lot of heat the thermal energy in the global climate system has grown with only brief pauses since at least 1970 and over 90 of this extra energy has been stored in the ocean the rest has heated the atmosphere melted ice and warmed the continents the northern hemisphere and the north pole have warmed much faster than the south pole and southern hemisphere the northern hemisphere not only has much more land but also more seasonal snow cover and sea ice as these surfaces flip from reflecting a lot of light to being dark after the ice has melted they start absorbing more heat local black carbon deposits on snow and ice also contribute to arctic warming arctic surface temperatures are increasing between three and four times faster than in the rest of the world melting of ice sheets near the poles weakens both the atlantic and the antarctic limb of thermohaline circulation which further changes the distribution of heat and precipitation around the globe future global temperatures the world meteorological organization estimates there is almost a 50 chance of the fiveyear average global temperature exceeding 15 c between 2024 and 2028 the ipcc expects the 20year average to exceed 15 c in the early 2030s the ipcc sixth assessment report 2021 included projections that by 2100 global warming is very likely to reach 1018 c under a scenario with very low emissions of greenhouse gases 2135 c under an intermediate emissions scenario or 3357 c under a very high emissions scenario the warming will continue past 2100 in the intermediate and high emission scenarios with future projections of global surface temperatures by year 2300 being similar to millions of years ago the remaining carbon budget for staying beneath certain temperature increases is determined by modelling the carbon cycle and climate sensitivity to greenhouse gases according to unep global warming can be kept below 20 c with a 50 chance if emissions after 2023 do not exceed 900 gigatonnes of co2 this carbon budget corresponds to around 16 years of current emissions causes of recent global temperature rise the climate system experiences various cycles on its own which can last for years decades or even centuries for example el nio events cause shortterm spikes in surface temperature while la nia events cause short term cooling their relative frequency can affect global temperature trends on a decadal timescale other changes are caused by an imbalance of energy from external forcings examples of these include changes in the concentrations of greenhouse gases solar luminosity volcanic eruptions and variations in the earths orbit around the sun to determine the human contribution to climate change unique fingerprints for all potential causes are developed and compared with both observed patterns and known internal climate variability for example solar forcingwhose fingerprint involves warming the entire atmosphereis ruled out because only the lower atmosphere has warmed atmospheric aerosols produce a smaller cooling effect other drivers such as changes in albedo are less impactful greenhouse gases greenhouse gases are transparent to sunlight and thus allow it to pass through the atmosphere to heat the earths surface the earth radiates it as heat and greenhouse gases absorb a portion of it this absorption slows the rate at which heat escapes into space trapping heat near the earths surface and warming it over time while water vapour 50 and clouds 25 are the biggest contributors to the greenhouse effect they primarily change as a function of temperature and are therefore mostly considered to be feedbacks that change climate sensitivity on the other hand concentrations of gases such as co2 20 tropospheric ozone cfcs and nitrous oxide are added or removed independently from temperature and are therefore considered to be external forcings that change global temperatures before the industrial revolution naturally occurring amounts of greenhouse gases caused the air near the surface to be about 33 c warmer than it would have been in their absence human activity since the industrial revolution mainly extracting and burning fossil fuels coal oil and natural gas has increased the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere in 2022 the concentrations of co2 and methane had increased by about 50 and 164 respectively since 1750 these co2 levels are higher than they have been at any time during the last 14 million years concentrations of methane are far higher than they were over the last 800000 years global humancaused greenhouse gas emissions in 2019 were equivalent to 59 billion tonnes of co2 of these emissions 75 was co2 18 was methane 4 was nitrous oxide and 2 was fluorinated gases co2 emissions primarily come from burning fossil fuels to provide energy for transport manufacturing heating and electricity additional co2 emissions come from deforestation and industrial processes which include the co2 released by the chemical reactions for making cement steel aluminium and fertilizer methane emissions come from livestock manure rice cultivation landfills wastewater and coal mining as well as oil and gas extraction nitrous oxide emissions largely come from the microbial decomposition of fertilizer while methane only lasts in the atmosphere for an average of 12 years co2 lasts much longer the earths surface absorbs co2 as part of the carbon cycle while plants on land and in the ocean absorb most excess emissions of co2 every year that co2 is returned to the atmosphere when biological matter is digested burns or decays landsurface carbon sink processes such as carbon fixation in the soil and photosynthesis remove about 29 of annual global co2 emissions the ocean has absorbed 20 to 30 of emitted co2 over the last two decades co2 is only removed from the atmosphere for the long term when it is stored in the earths crust which is a process that can take millions of years to complete land surface changes around 30 of earths land area is largely unusable for humans glaciers deserts etc 26 is forests 10 is shrubland and 34 is agricultural land deforestation is the main land use change contributor to global warming as the destroyed trees release co2 and are not replaced by new trees removing that carbon sink between 2001 and 2018 27 of deforestation was from permanent clearing to enable agricultural expansion for crops and livestock another 24 has been lost to temporary clearing under the shifting cultivation agricultural systems 26 was due to logging for wood and derived products and wildfires have accounted for the remaining 23 some forests have not been fully cleared but were already degraded by these impacts restoring these forests also recovers their potential as a carbon sink local vegetation cover impacts how much of the sunlight gets reflected back into space albedo and how much heat is lost by evaporation for instance the change from a dark forest to grassland makes the surface lighter causing it to reflect more sunlight deforestation can also modify the release of chemical compounds that influence clouds and by changing wind patterns in tropic and temperate areas the net effect is to produce significant warming and forest restoration can make local temperatures cooler at latitudes closer to the poles there is a cooling effect as forest is replaced by snowcovered and more reflective plains globally these increases in surface albedo have been the dominant direct influence on temperature from land use change thus land use change to date is estimated to have a slight cooling effect other factors aerosols and clouds air pollution in the form of aerosols affects the climate on a large scale aerosols scatter and absorb solar radiation from 1961 to 1990 a gradual reduction in the amount of sunlight reaching the earths surface was observed this phenomenon is popularly known as global dimming and is primarily attributed to sulfate aerosols produced by the combustion of fossil fuels with heavy sulfur concentrations like coal and bunker fuel smaller contributions come from black carbon from combustion of fossil fuels and biomass and from dust globally aerosols have been declining since 1990 due to pollution controls meaning that they no longer mask greenhouse gas warming as much aerosols also have indirect effects on the earths energy budget sulfate aerosols act as cloud condensation nuclei and lead to clouds that have more and smaller cloud droplets these clouds reflect solar radiation more efficiently than clouds with fewer and larger droplets they also reduce the growth of raindrops which makes clouds more reflective to incoming sunlight indirect effects of aerosols are the largest uncertainty in radiative forcing while aerosols typically limit global warming by reflecting sunlight black carbon in soot that falls on snow or ice can contribute to global warming not only does this increase the absorption of sunlight it also increases melting and sealevel rise limiting new black carbon deposits in the arctic could reduce global warming by 02 c by 2050 the effect of decreasing sulfur content of fuel oil for ships since 2020 is estimated to cause an additional 005 c increase in global mean temperature by 2050 solar and volcanic activity as the sun is the earths primary energy source changes in incoming sunlight directly affect the climate system solar irradiance has been measured directly by satellites and indirect measurements are available from the early 1600s onwards since 1880 there has been no upward trend in the amount of the suns energy reaching the earth in contrast to the warming of the lower atmosphere the troposphere the upper atmosphere the stratosphere would also be warming if the sun was sending more energy to earth but instead it has been cooling this is consistent with greenhouse gases preventing heat from leaving the earths atmosphere explosive volcanic eruptions can release gases dust and ash that partially block sunlight and reduce temperatures or they can send water vapour into the atmosphere which adds to greenhouse gases and increases temperatures these impacts on temperature only last for several years because both water vapour and volcanic material have low persistence in the atmosphere volcanic co2 emissions are more persistent but they are equivalent to less than 1 of current humancaused co2 emissions volcanic activity still represents the single largest natural impact forcing on temperature in the industrial era yet like the other natural forcings it has had negligible impacts on global temperature trends since the industrial revolution climate change feedbacks the climate systems response to an initial forcing is shaped by feedbacks which either amplify or dampen the change selfreinforcing or positive feedbacks increase the response while balancing or negative feedbacks reduce it the main reinforcing feedbacks are the watervapour feedback the icealbedo feedback and the net cloud feedback the primary balancing mechanism is radiative cooling as earths surface gives off more heat to space in response to rising temperature in addition to temperature feedbacks there are feedbacks in the carbon cycle such as the fertilizing effect of co2 on plant growth feedbacks are expected to trend in a positive direction as greenhouse gas emissions continue raising climate sensitivity these feedback processes alter the pace of global warming for instance warmer air can hold more moisture in the form of water vapour which is itself a potent greenhouse gas warmer air can also make clouds higher and thinner and therefore more insulating increasing climate warming the reduction of snow co",
