    "the democrat wave in 2025 and the return of the yellow dog democrat well that was a depressing election day wasnt it the big three plus two 2025 elections have all been tabulated and the democrats won bigly new jersey governor in new jersey the democrats won a yuge race for governor democrat rep mikie sherrill nj11 despite being a terrible candidate according to normal candidate metrics beat republican jack ciattarelli 563 percent to 432 percent my prediction was totally off here as i assumed that the republican nominee would win a narrow majority or plurality in this race democrats broke a historical trend going back to 1961 despite the unpopularity of the sitting democrat new jersey governor and his poor management of taxes and energy policies so why did this unprecedented event happen there appear to be three distinct possibilities 1 florida gov ron desantis claimed that jack ciattarelli would have won four years ago and he would have won tonight if you just take all the republicans whove left new jersey since ive been governor and they moved to florida 2 i reached out to one of my little birds in new jersey a prominent conservative pollster and he argued that ciattarelli had no message and that he could not define what change is just being for change is not enough it allows your opponent to define what the change is but keep in mind when a campaign loses it is frequently blamed on the lack of a message 3 political guru ryan girdusky blamed yuge democrat turnout in the end ciattarelli received 122000 more votes than he got in 2021 more votes than gov phil murphy d received when he won reelection that year but it wasnt enough because sherrill received about 450k more votes than murphy and only 400k less than kamala received it is also possible that the results were some combination of the three feel free to pick your poison",

    "the man who stole 45 billion partied with leonardo dicaprio and vanished into china let me tell you about the night britney spears jumped out of a cake to wish happy birthday to a man whod stolen billions of dollars from an entire country it was november 2012 las vegas a nightclub so exclusive you needed to be on a very specific guest list to even know it existed and there surrounded by hollywood alisters supermodels and the children of oil sheiks was jho low a softspoken slightly pudgy malaysian man who nobody had heard of five years earlier celebrating his 31st birthday while britney spears literally emerged from a giant cake singing to him leonardo dicaprio was there paris hilton was there kim kardashian was there they were all there because jho low had paid them to be there with money hed stolen from malaysias sovereign wealth fund while pretending to be developing his country and heres the thing that makes this story so perfectly darkly absurd at that exact moment jho low was financing a martin scorsese film called the wolf of wall street a movie about a corrupt stockbroker who steals millions and hides the money in foreign banks this is the story of how a nobody from malaysia became the worlds most successful financial criminal threw the most expensive parties in human history bought his way into hollywood and then disappeared into china where hes reportedly living under a fake identity as a greekaustralian businessman while working as a secret advisor to the chinese government and the craziest part is most of the money is still missing but lets start at the beginning the poor rich kid heres what you need to understand about jho low he wasnt poor his grandfather had built an empire in ironore mining liquor and real estate across thailand malaysia and hong kong his father sold a textile company for 15 million by any normal standard jho low was born into serious wealth but he wasnt born into enough wealth and that psychological wound that sense of being rich but not rich enough is what created the monster when jho lows parents sent him to harrow school in london the same boarding school that educated winston churchill and seven british prime ministers he found himself surrounded by kids whose families made his family look middleclass saudi princes children of russian oligarchs heirs to billiondollar fortunes that had existed for centuries and jho low the son of a successful malaysian textile manufacturer was suddenly at the bottom of the wealth hierarchy he had money but he was surrounded by people with unfathomable money money so vast it had its own gravity money that opened doors he couldnt even see thats where it started not in poverty not in desperation in relative deprivation in the psychological torture of being wealthy enough to see into the world of the superelite but not wealthy enough to truly belong there so he decided to steal his way in learning to buy people after harrow jho low made a calculated decision he didnt go to cambridge or oxford like most harrow graduates he went to wharton the university of pennsylvanias business school not because he cared about the education spoiler he never actually graduated but because wharton was where the worlds richest young people went to pretend they cared about learning business and jho low didnt go to wharton to study he went to wharton to network his classmates included the children of gulf princes saudi oil sheiks and heirs to multinational corporations and jho low softspoken awkward with women not particularly charismatic figured out something brilliant he couldnt compete with these people on inherited wealth or social pedigree but he could compete on throwing parties so thats what he did he rented out nightclubs in philadelphia spent tens of thousands of dollars per event made sure the guest lists included all the right people for his 20th birthday he dropped 40000 to rent shampoo one of philadelphias hottest clubs he invited ivanka trump on gambling trips to atlantic city he became obsessed with paris hilton and reportedly watched house of wax her movie over and over again he was buying his way into social circles he couldnt organically access and it worked because heres what jho low understood that most people dont rich people really rich people are deeply profoundly bored and the person who can cure that boredom who can make things happen who can get the best clubs and the best celebrities and the most exclusive experiences becomes valuable jho low made himself valuable not through talent or charm or intelligence through money specifically through spending more money than anyone else was willing to spend on making rich kids have fun and through those parties he met the people who would later help him steal billions he met riza aziz who happened to be the stepson of najib razak malaysias future prime minister he met yousef al otaiba a foreign policy advisor to uae sheikhs who introduced him to khaldoon khalifa al mubarak who ran mubadala development a sovereign wealth fund managing billions these werent random friendships these were strategic acquisitions jho low was collecting powerful people the way some people collect stamps and he was doing it by throwing the best parties anyone had ever seen the first lie heres a detail thats easy to miss but absolutely critical jho low never actually graduated from wharton he dropped out but for the rest of his career when meeting with bankers when pitching deals when building his reputation as an international financier he told everyone he had a wharton degree when joanna yu a relationship manager at ambank in malaysia first met jho low she believed hed graduated from wharton because low had provided her with a letter stating exactly that years later when lows lawyer revealed that low had never actually graduated yu was genuinely shocked this wasnt just resume padding this was the foundational lie that made everything else possible because when youre trying to convince people to give you access to billions of dollars wharton graduate carries weight it signals legitimacy intelligence connections it opens doors jho low understood that credentials arent about what you actually accomplished theyre about what people believe you accomplished and if you lie convincingly enough if you provide the right documentation if you never hesitate if you act like its obviously true people wont question it nobody checked nobody verified a missing diploma became a wharton education through the simple mechanism of saying it enough times that it became true the art of the namedrop after leaving wharton dropout status carefully concealed jho low returned to malaysia with a new identity international financier with connections to the worlds wealthiest families according to joanna yu who managed lows accounts at ambank lows conversational style was distinctive he would constantly mention that he was going to meet somebody from kuwait or reference conversations with the governor of bank negara malaysia or the prime minister of malaysia or prince turki alsaud of saudi arabia these werent casual mentions they were strategic deployments even if the conversations hadnt happened even if low had simply been in the same room as these people at some event the repetition created an aura of access think about how this works psychologically if someone mentions once that they know a prince you might be sceptical but if that same person casually references conversations with princes prime ministers governors and sheikhs across dozens of interactions your brain starts accepting it as background reality the sheer volume of namedropping becomes its own evidence jho low wasnt just lying he was constructing a persona through accumulation each tiny lie reinforced the previous lies until the whole structure felt solid enough to support billions of dollars in fraud 2009 the big score begins now we get to the actual crime and its important to understand that what jho low did was not a simple theft it was architecture he built elaborate financial structures specifically designed to make stealing look like investing in 2009 malaysias new prime minister najib razak whose stepson youll remember jho low had befriended at wharton created something called 1malaysia development berhad 1mdb for short it was supposed to be a sovereign wealth fund that would invest in development projects and make malaysia rich najib invited jho low to become involved as an advisor and thats when low saw his opportunity the petrosaudi scam august 2009 a yacht in monaco najib and low are meeting with representatives from petrosaudi international an oil drilling company theyre discussing a joint venture 1mdb would invest 1 billion into a partnership with petrosaudi acquiring 40 equity in a new company called 1mdb petrosaudi limited on paper it looked legitimate malaysias sovereign wealth fund partnering with an oil company to develop energy resources exactly the kind of thing sovereign wealth funds are supposed to do but heres what actually happened on september 30 2009 when that 1 billion was transferred 300 million went to the legitimate joint venture account at jpmorgan 700 million went to an account at rbs coutts bank in zurich belonging to a shell company called good star limited and who owned good star limited jho low personally when the banks compliance team asked who owned good star 1mdbs ceo falsely claimed it was owned by petrosaudi but it wasnt it was jho lows personal account hed just stolen 700 million in a single transaction by creating a fake company with a name that sounded official enough that nobody checked low didnt just wire money from 1mdb to himself he created corporate structures joint ventures investment agreements loan documents he made the theft look like business and business is so complicated involves so many parties and documents and jurisdictions that unravelling it requires forensic accountants working for years between may and october 2011 good star received another 330 million in transfers each one disguised as legitimate business transactions by the end low had personally stolen over 1 billion from malaysias sovereign wealth fund and almost nobody knew it was happening the goldman sachs connection by 2012 jho low had refined his operation he wasnt content stealing hundreds of millions he wanted billions and to do that he needed goldman sachs goldman sachs one of the most prestigious investment banks on earth with compliance systems and risk management and all the institutional safeguards designed to prevent exactly this kind of fraud agreed to underwrite three massive bond offerings for 1mdb between 2012 and 2013 total raised 65 billion goldmans fees nearly 600 million heres how it worked according to former goldman banker tim leissner who was later convicted and sentenced to prison for his role in 2012 jho low convened a meeting in his london apartment where he explicitly outlined which malaysian and uae officials would receive bribes to ensure goldman was selected as 1mdbs underwriter it wasnt subtle it wasnt hidden low literally explained the bribery structure to goldman bankers and they proceeded with the deal anyway billions from those bond offerings were then systematically diverted into offshore shell companies controlled by low and his associates the bonds were supposed to fund malaysian development projects power plants real estate infrastructure instead the money flowed through a web of shell companies in switzerland singapore and the cayman islands ultimately ending up in accounts low could access from just one of those bond transactions prosecutors allege low stole 14 billion goldman sachs eventually paid a 29 billion settlement to malaysia one of the largest wall street penalties in history but the settlement allowed goldman to avoid admitting wrongdoing which raises the obvious question how complicit was goldman sachs as an institution were leissner and roger ng another goldman banker who was convicted just rogue actors or did goldmans corporate culture enable the fraud we will probably never get a definitive answer but what we know for certain is that one of the worlds most sophisticated financial institutions facilitated the theft of billions of dollars and jho low made it possible by understanding something fundamental if you bribe the right people and make the paperwork complicated enough even goldman sachs will look the other way what did he do with 45 billion now heres where the story shifts from financial crime to pure unhinged excess because jho low didnt steal billions to hide them in swiss bank accounts and live quietly he stole billions to throw the most expensive parties in human history and buy his way into hollywood the leonardo dicaprio friendship jho low met leonardo dicaprio at a las vegas party in 2010 and what began as a casual acquaintance rapidly evolved into something much weirder low became dicaprios financier party sponsor and giftgiverinchief low financed massive parties in las vegas los angeles and on yachts in the mediterranean he invited alist celebrities alicia keys paris hilton britney spears kanye west kim kardashian he paid emily ratajkowski 25000 just to attend the super bowl with him he donated millions to dicaprios environmental foundation and he gave dicaprio absurdly expensive gifts a 32 million picasso painting a first edition of the great gatsby an academy award statuette that marlon brando won for on the waterfront think about what that last gift means low somehow acquired one of hollywoods most sacred objects an actual oscar won by one of historys greatest actors and gave it to dicaprio like it was a novelty item the federal government eventually seized it along with the picasso and the gatsby but the gesture reveals everything about lows psychology he was using stolen money to buy proximity to fame and proximity to fame as proof that hed finally transcended his origins the wolf of wall street this is where the story achieves perfect ironic symmetry through his connection with riza aziz the malaysian prime ministers stepson low cofounded red granite pictures and used embezzled 1mdb funds to finance hollywood films the most infamous martin scorseses 2013 film the wolf of wall street starring leonardo dicaprio the film is about jordan belfort a corrupt stockbroker who steals millions through securities fraud and attempts to hide his illgotten gains in foreign safe havens sound familiar according to court documents a 9 million advance was made to red granite for the wolf of wall street in september 2012 paid directly from accounts controlled by jho low using stolen 1mdb money and as a final flourish of audacity low personally thanked himself in the films closing credits he stole billions from malaysia used that money to finance a movie about stealing money and hiding it offshore and then thanked himself publicly for financing the movie while federal investigators were already beginning to trace his fraud the department of justice eventually seized royalties from three red granite productions the wolf of wall street daddys home and dumb and dumber to but by then the damage was done low had successfully purchased a place in hollywood history and the fact that hed done it with stolen money almost made the achievement more impressive to the people whod spent time with him the yacht the gambling the jewellery lets talk about the 250 million superyacht in 2014 low took delivery of the equanimity a 300foot floating palace with a gym an olympicsized swimming pool a private art gallery a beauty salon a helipad and sleeping quarters for 22 guests the running costs were approximately 500000 per month just to maintain when malaysian authorities finally seized it in 2018 and tried to auction it off to recover stolen funds they could only get 130 million 52 of its purchase price because even among billionaires there are only so many people willing to buy a yacht thats internationally famous as the product of massive financial fraud then there was the gambling court testimony from the venetian casino in las vegas revealed that low gambled approximately 87 million there over the years losing 26 million one particularly bad session saw him lose 175 million in 90 minutes playing baccarat casino executives described him as extremely extravagant making requests parallel to none including custom disco balls dance floors and dedicated djs and the jewellery low purchased a 129 million heartshaped diamond for model miranda kerr along with a 38 million diamond pendant she was eventually forced to surrender both to federal authorities he bought art by picasso warhol and monet worth collectively 35 million all of it eventually seized by governments trying to recover the stolen billions heres whats psychologically fascinating jho low wasnt hiding his wealth most criminals who steal billions try to hide the money live quietly avoid attention low did the opposite he threw parties that made international news he hung out with the most famous people on earth he bought yachts that appeared in magazines its like he needed the world to see that hed finally made it that he was no longer the kid at harrow who wasnt quite wealthy enough that hed transcended his origins through sheer force of spending and that compulsive display is exactly what allowed investigators to trace where the money went the political bribery heres a detail that got buried in all the yacht and dicaprio coverage according to court testimony jho low attempted to donate upwards of 30 million to barack obamas 2012 reelection campaign think about that a malaysian national attempting to illegally funnel tens of millions of stolen dollars into an american presidential campaign the donation never went through for campaign finance laws but the attempt reveals the scope of lows ambitions he wasnt content buying celebrities and yachts he wanted to buy political power he wanted access to the president of the united states and he believed probably correctly that enough money could get him that access 2015 when everything started falling apart by mid2015 investigative journalists had started publishing stories about 1mdbs irregularities malaysian whistleblowers were coming forward the wall street journal published detailed reports about money flowing from 1mdb into prime minister najibs personal bank accounts the entire scheme was unravelling and jho low recognizing that his time was running out made a decision that separates him from most whitecollar criminals he ran not quietly not subtly he just left first to taiwan no extradition treaty with malaysia or the us then to macau perfect for a highrolling gambler who needed to hide and eventually according to investigative journalists to mainland china in july 2018 malaysian police confirmed low had fled macau for mainland china and thats where the trail goes cold sort of the shanghai mystery in july 2025 almost a decade after fleeing malaysia investigative journalists bradley hope and tom wright who wrote the definitive book on the 1mdb scandal claimed in a livestream that theyd found jho low according to their investigation low is currently living in shanghais exclusive green hills neighbourhood under a fake identity constantinos achilles veis using a forged australian passport even more provocatively they claim low is now operating as a behindthescenes strategist for the chinese government helping sanctioned chinese companies navigate global regulatory challenges let that sink in the man who stole 45 billion from malaysia threw parties with britney spears and leo dicaprio financed the wolf of wall street and became one of historys most wanted fugitives is allegedly now working for the chinese government under a fake greekaustralian identity malaysian authorities responded by saying they have no solid evidence to verify these claims australias department of foreign affairs confirmed that passport fraud carries penalties of up to 10 years imprisonment but said they couldnt comment on individual cases so as of now in 2025 we have credible investigative journalists claiming they know exactly where jho low is and what hes doing but no government has been able to confirm it or do anything about it the questions lets talk about what we dont know because the gaps in this story are almost as interesting as what we do know wheres the rest of the money malaysia has recovered approximately 74 billion in assets sounds like a lot until you realize that at least 13 billion remains completely unaccounted for low spent maybe a billion on yachts parties jewellery gambling and real estate that leaves billions that nobody can find does low have it hidden in accounts that havent been discovered did he transfer it to people we dont know about is it sitting in chinese banks under names nobodys connected to him yet we dont know prime minister mahathir mohamad said in 2019 that evidence suggests jho low kept a lot of the 1mdb money for himself but tracking it has proven impossible its out there somewhere billions of dollars just missing why is china protecting him if the reports are true and low is living openly in shanghai working for the chinese government the obvious question is why several theories 1 low is providing valuable services to china helping sanctioned companies maybe providing intelligence about western financial systems 2 china is using low as leverage against malaysia give us what we want or well never return your fugitive 3 low has hidden chinese government money in his network of accounts and china needs him alive and cooperative to access it 4 china simply doesnt care about malaysian or american law and enjoys thumbing its nose at western justice systems we dont know which is true probably some combination but whats clear is that if low is in china hes not there by accident china doesnt let internationally wanted fugitives accused of stealing billions just wander around shanghai unless theres a reason was najib razak the mastermind or the dupe najib razak the former prime minister of malaysia is currently serving a 12year prison sentence for corruption related to 1mdb but heres whats weird najib claims his relationship with jho low has been exaggerated and that other people 1mdb ceo shahrol halmi general counsel jasmine loo and ambank manager joanna yu were actually closer to low najib sarcastically noted that yu made jho low soup when he was unwell whereas i never prepared any meals for jho low is this just a politician trying to minimize his guilt probably but theres a legitimate question about who was actually running the scheme low had the connections the financial expertise the elaborate network of shell companies najib had the political power to make it possible who was manipulating whom and heres the thing that makes you wonder najib is in prison low is allegedly living in luxury in shanghai if they were equal partners in the crime thats some seriously unequal justice what happened to all the other conspirators tim leissner the goldman sachs banker got sentenced to prison roger ng another goldman banker got 10 years some malaysian officials got prosecuted goldman sachs paid billions in fines but what about all the other people who had to have been involved the lawyers who set up shell companies the bankers who processed transactions that they must have known were suspicious the accountants who signed off on fraudulent financial statements the politicians beyond najib who took bribes hundreds of people had to have been involved in enabling a fraud this massive most of them have never been identified let alone prosecuted why did he do it jho low was already rich his family had money he had connections he could have lived a comfortable legitimate life as a malaysian businessman or investor instead he orchestrated one of historys largest financial frauds knowing that if caught hed spend decades in prison or become a permanent fugitive why the simple answer is greed but i dont think thats the whole story because lows spending wasnt rational he wasnt accumulating wealth to secure his future he was burning through billions as fast as he could steal them throwing parties buying yachts gambling millions giving away picassos he was trying to prove something to the rich kids at harrow whod looked down on him to the wharton classmates whose families made his family look middleclass to himself and he achieved that for about five years jho low was exactly that person he was legendary people talked about his parties the way they talk about studio 54 or the playboy mansion he was the most interesting person in any room he entered not because of his personality by all accounts he was quiet and awkward but because of his willingness to spend whatever it took to create unforgettable experiences the moral of this extremely immoral story if theres a lesson in the jho low saga its probably this the global financial system is shockingly easy to manipulate if you have the right connections the right documentation and the willingness to lie convincingly you can steal billions from a sovereign wealth fund with goldman sachs facilitating the transactions and throw parties with leonardo dicaprio and finance hollywood movies about financial fraud and live in luxury for years before anyone figures out what youve done",
    "politics yap session dont read when trump first ran i voted against him when he was elected i chose to believe this was a fluke glitch in the system or a timeline shift in other words something that wasnt meant to happen many people even trump voters felt the same way because it was a very highly unlikely event within context of the time over the five years 20162021 we watched our media institutions degrade into a contest over who can bash trump the hardest and fear monger the american public the most to raise ratings the truth is our media was long gone years before then but due to someone being in power that was unpredictable at the time made corporate sponsors uneasy 1st term synopsis trump was a lame duck for most of his term sent a few bombs and upheld the status quo for the most part messed up with the handling of c19 towards the end of his term of course biden was then elected and absolutely nothing changed the country kept getting more expensive and inflation skyrocketed legacy media tries to convince the public the president is capable to lead the country unsuccessfully the american public elects trump again as the white knight to reignite a fading star obviously trump is a showman and doesnt know the first thing about economic policy trumps prowess is in performance and so he goes through the motions deports thousands enlarges the debt helps israel as per usual and stirs up tensions with china my point is hes just an accelerationist who has his foot slammed on the pedal and has just unscrewed the nitrous nozzle hes speeding the country towards the truth whatever it may hold demise biden wouldnt have done a thing differently in his shoes perhaps let more illegal migrants in but that doesnt make a difference in the grand scheme of things does it the scourge of america is the national deficit and politicians will never stop dancing around it they wont get elected if they talk about regulating spending increasing taxation and taking accountability theyll get a lot more votes by claiming immigrants and discriminating against trans people is the biggest threat they want to prop up the stock market and make as many billions as they can before jumping ship and moving to dubai india when the water level reaches their chin so trump isnt the bad guy hes spending 3 trillion to try and give us and his billionaire friends the best 20 years of our life more so the billionaires before its all blown away to kingdom come trump is actually the best president for us because he has experience going bankrupt like 5 times lol",

    "fighting at the soap box freeman here the other day i described the doctrine of the three boxes a couple of the commenters had good stuff to add too so even if you read it maybe click over to see whats up today i want to dig a little deeper into how we win or lose at the first box the soap box if youre reading this im going to assume youre on the side of democracy and you value the promise of america the promise of liberty and justice for all of e pluribus unum of a nation that was built on an idea of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness for all and has spent the last 250 years trying struggling but always reaching to live up to its ideals if thats you well weve really dropped the ball at this first box the soap box is all the ways we speak about our vision of america and we got lazy while we let the schools do our talking figuring the teachers would raise the next generation to the right values of public good the alt right was figuring out 4chan and tik tok and twitter they literally own the dominant social media channels now they have their own major television channel and they have created such a perfect echo chamber that they have convinced themselves that they are a persecuted majority lets pause on that for a second a persecuted majority the very notion is ridiculous in a free democracy majorities dont get persecuted but when people feel entitled to something they arent getting they have to explain that to themselves and the cognitive dissonance often results in a notion of being a persecuted majority if germans were so clever and superior why did they lose wwi must have been the jews if white guys are so hip and cool why cant they get a date must be the immigrants yeah the real issue is jobs and wages but they dont call themselves involuntary low wage earners they call themselves incels involuntary celibates tells you pretty much all you need to know about their mentality it started with the christian right and now its spread to pretty much the entire right wing in this country theyve convinced themselves of two basically contradictory facts 1 they think they are the majority this is part of why they assume any election they lose is fraudulent its also why they feel so comfortable spouting their bullshit they assume everyone else is thinking the same thing the reason they are saying it and we are not they think isnt because we disagree with them its because were not as brave and confident and manly as they are so when you hear one of them saying some stupid nonsense remember they arent trying to convince anyone because they figure everyone in earshot is in agreement theyre trying to show their strength dont just listen in silence prove them wrong not in their ideas but in their assumption they are not the majority they just think they are 2 they think they are being repressed first of all majorities cant be repressed pretty much by definition i mean well yeah numerical majorities can workers slaves serfs plebians history is full of repressed numerical majorities but in a true democracy where civil rights are guaranteed to all that becomes more difficult not impossible were living that in real time but difficult but when i say majorities cant be repressed i mean political or social majorities groups that hold power in a society and who holds power in american society um white folks malepresenting folks christian folks and of course folks with money and who are the mazis white christian mostly male and maleprioritizing female people with money oh wait you thought the magas were poor well sure compared to the billionaire oligarchs they worship and yeah some truly are but the fact is most of the folks showing up to trump rallies following him around the country standing outside mar a lago theyre actually pretty financially comfortable its how they can afford to go to those events after all in their big rvs its how they afford the trucks have you priced a fullsize pickup lately and the guns and the stupid trump merch so theyre pretty much the folks who have always had access to all the good stuff america has to offer so why do they feel persecuted because the alt right has been dominating the soap box you see for years decades really theyve been hearing it from the pulpit and from the news neither fox nor talk radio and now podcasts really presents news but they pretend they do theyve been hearing that they are the moral majority the silent majority and that the reason they arent happy with their lives is external didnt get that promotion they wanted its not because they didnt work hard enough or go to college its because someone brown or female was promoted instead their candidate didnt win the election democrat chicanery that new truck is too expensive blame an immigrant i cant really explain all the logic here in part because this is a reddit post not a sociology book and in part because well im not sure there is any logic how do immigrants make prices go up i guess cause they also buy stuff so demand is up except more workers means wages go down so that keeps prices lower but also it is the reason you didnt get a raise well assuming youre working in a field dominated by immigrants most of us arent getting raises because the corner office folks are making billions but thats another story based on actual facts and not the one the mazis hear so the mazis are fed a steady stream of exaggerated news about the problems in america especially crime and theyre fed a bunch of false data about these made up problems crime is high and its all committed by black people and mexicans and muslims somehow school violence is up because the teachers are something trans that one gets really weird really fast some guy in rural tennessee is told he cant require his high school football team to pray to jesus and its blown up into the equivalent of the romans feeding christians to the lions this is the right wing soap box and they have also been brilliant at spreading the word for years most waiting rooms in america have had a tv on and its been tuned to fox why because if it was tuned to some other news channel a conservative complained to management but if it was on fox we just looked away read our magazines and said nothing so fox spreads and the conservatives feel that they are the majority for years conservatives have put various symbols and slogans on bumper stickers and shown themselves sometimes obviously sometimes subtly some of the bumper stickers said things like taxation is theft okay we know where that guy stands but some were more subtle iii or molon labe which i like to read as moron lame which might need to be googled iii is the three percenters a group who believes that just 3 of the population rebelled against britain so a wellarmed minority can overthrow a tyrannical read democratic government moron lame is a greek phrase attributed to leonidas the king of the spartans when he was asked to lay down his arms it basically means come and take them but the point of all of those wasnt really to convince us it was to signal each other they really say see me im here im with you were right were the majority the subtlety of some of these signs and messages actually reinforces the persecution complex too christians love to tell themselves the story of the fish being drawn quickly on the side of buildings in rome to indicate a forbidden christian church and then quickly rubbed away afterwards so putting a fish sticker on your car or business or whatever not only shows that youre a christian it also shows that you are standing up to persecution what persecution the persecution of not having the nativity scene displayed in your local mall or something definitely right up there with being fed to lions okay so what do we do well the good news is some of it is already being done there might not be a direct liberal equivalent to fox but thats a good thing we dont want our people brainwashed we want them educated and for that we have npr and the ny times sure but we also have stephen colbert and jimmy kimmel every time a comedian makes a joke at trumps expense its a ding in the alt right armor ive also noticed a distinct decline in the fox programming in the waiting rooms instead im seeing a lot of hgtv and the like that means business owners are starting to fear a reaction from the left as well as from the right good but we need to do more maybe youve seen some version of the make nazis afraid again stuff thats what we need to do the alt right folks in the regime are getting bolder and that just emboldens the ones on the street but we just won some major electoral victories more on that when i talk about the ballot box and none of the doomsday stuff about right wing violence has come to pass this is good the alt right might be telling themselves its a bloodless civil war but if so theyre losing so the folks saying the quiet part out loud are getting louder but theyre also getting more isolated keep that up put that npr magnet on your car wear that bernie tshirt you got talk about mamdani in the convenience store let the radical reactionaries hear and see just how isolated they are we are the actual silent majority its time to start being heard freeman out",

    "trumps latest attempt to defuse the epstein revolt point supporters at common enemies published 072125 238 pm edt written by matt gertz president donald trump is seeking to reunify allies enraged by his administrations repudiation of maga claims about late convicted sex offender and disgraced financier jeffrey epstein by offering up spurious attacks on common and familiar enemies the media in this case rupert murdochs wall street journal and former president barack obama trump brought together an ideologically diverse coalition and a fractured rightwing media ecosystem during his 2024 campaign based largely on their shared hatred for democrats liberal institutions like the press and the left his administrations actions have at times sparked criticism from different factions over the handling of issues like the russiaukraine war tariffs us strikes on iran immigration enforcement and most of all disclosures in the epstein case the president spent last week failing to tamp down discussion of the epstein story that seemed to be fracturing the maga movement he tried claiming that his political enemies had written the epstein files argued that the epstein case is pretty boring stuff and even lashed out at supporters who talk about it as weaklings and stupid people but while the propagandists at fox news were willing to play ball trumps statements backfired elsewhere leaving many rightwing media figures and the base alike in a state of revolt on thursday however the wall street journal reported that a bawdy letter bearing trumps signature had been included in an album created for epsteins 50th birthday before allegations of his sexual abuse of girls became publicly known the document according to the journal had been reviewed by justice department officials who handled epsteins case the journal report could have focused the rights attention on trumps voluminous ties to epstein but trump redirected them at a familiar target journalists he responded that night by calling the paper fake denouncing the paper and claiming that he would sue the following day he followed through with a defamation lawsuit seeking 10 billion in damages from the two authors of the article the journals publisher dow jones co parent company news corp and that companys ceo and murdoch himself trumps lawsuit is both unprecedented and consistent with trumps authoritarian treatment of a free press whose criticism he seeks to curtail through corrupt means the message it sends is straightforward if you publish reporting that displeases the president even if like murdoch your support was crucial to his political ascension he may try to ruin you so dont try it while the journals corporate cousins at fox news mostly avoided the story on friday the networks competitors throughout the fractured marketplace of rightwing media responded by sharpening their knives and attacking the paper laura loomer deemed the journal story totally fake charlie kirk accused the journal

an exclusive gabbard claimed to have uncovered documents proving a treasonous conspiracy in 2016 committed by officials at the highest level of our government which aimed to subvert the will of the american people and enact what was essentially a yearslong coup she suggested that figures including obama must be investigated and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and said she was referring the documents to the justice department leaving nothing to subtext trump subsequently posted to truth social an ai video featuring obama being arrested and imprisoned those documents however demonstrate nothing other than gabbards own ignorance andor malice they show that obama received an intelligence report that russia had not hacked election systems to change vote totals in the 2016 election which is consistent with what the obama administration said publicly at the time then asked for and subsequently received another intelligence report detailing other actions taken by the russian government in an effort to influence the election that effort according to the intelligence community the justice department and a senate committee helmed at the time by current secretary of state marco rubio included hacking and releasing democratic emails fox news contributor andrew mccarthy in a withering piece at national review described gabbards argument as a frivolous attempt to further trumps foolish stance that russia had not tried to influence the 2016 election via overwrought and misleading language and thundering claptrap but her attacks served to reignite years of conspiracymongering about the russia witch hunt and thus were credibly regurgitated elsewhere on the right including by foxs stars with some echoing gabbards demagogic language about purported treason trump meanwhile repeatedly posted fox clips and articles from rightwing media hyping the purported scandal much of maga media seems eager to target the journal and obama on trumps behalf but it remains to be seen whether those influencers or their audience will be willing to allow the epstein story to fade away altogether that said trumps best hope of keeping his supporters happy may very well be increasing the scale and tempo of his authoritarian attacks and that means there will be more to come in the months ahead think again newsrewind",

october paramount skydance bought the free press and hired its founder bari weiss as the editorinchief of cbs news a newly created position which will shape how the newsroom covers major stories which could include the climate crisis notably among the national broadcast networks cbs has led coverage of climate change for at least the past four years airing the most coverage the most climate scientist guest appearances and the most segments that discussed climate solutions as compared to abc and nbc but its role as network leader is already under threat reported by heated as part of a series of layoffs at the network the majority of the fiveperson team supporting cbs newss climate coverage were fired in the memo announcing the layoffs the new chief executive david ellison said he was phasing out roles that are no longer aligned with our evolving priorities and there are other changes that could compound this threat on october 24 it was reported that weiss was interested in poaching fox news anchor bret baier who has a troubling record on climate reporting to potentially helm the cbs evening news additional reporting suggests that she may also be interested in bringing on board another conservative voice cnn contributor scott jennings though weiss infrequently focused her contrarian opinions on climaterelated issues in her pieces for the new york times and on her podcast under her leadership as founder and editorinchief the free press has published a number of articles undermining climate science and promoting contrarian views that mirror commentary from rightwing media outlets like fox news the free press has undermined climate science on august 19 the free press reported on a widely criticized climate study from the department of energy through an interview with one of its authors steven koonin a climate contrarian who has appeared on several rightwing media programs including several appearances on fox news what about climate change is real thats one of the questions koonin was asked giving him space to misrepresent a united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change report that affirmed the link between climate change and extreme weather events in fact climate scientists have been able to estimate how much climate change affects any given extreme weather event for years notably researchers found that the heat wave that sent temperatures in the pacific northwest and canada into triple digits just six weeks before the release of the 2021 report would have been virtually impossible without global warming in january of this year the free press interviewed koonin to downplay the role of climate change in intensifying the la wildfires similar to rightwing media outlets like fox news the free press misleadingly suggested that thenpresident joe biden and many climate scientists claimed climate change was the cause of the fires rather than a contributing factor to the intensity of the blazes in 2023 the free press published one of its signature contrarian pieces titled i left out the full truth to get my climate change paper published by patrick t brown the author who works for breakthrough institute claims to have purposely limited his research paper showing warming temperatures increased the likelihood of wildfire growth in california in order to prove that articles in scientific journals were distorting the scientific process by focusing too narrowly on climate change as reported by the washington post the opinion piece quickly provoked backlash from scientists and the editor of nature herself the free press elevates contrarian and conservative voices to disparage climate activism and action in february of this year the free press published a piece by doomberg an independent publication focused on energy finance and geopolitics titled everybody freeze its the climate police which used a proposed policy in the city of ottawa limiting residents from using remote car starters to warm up their vehicles for more than one minute before driving and reporting that a washington democrat hopes to study the impact of medical anesthesia on climate change as proof that efforts to address climate change have gone too farand as a result caused a global popular revolt against climate action it is the kind of cherrypicked reporting fox news does to paint the climate movement as out of touch and radical and like with fox newss coverage it fails to either acknowledge the severity of the climate crisis or present the mainstream efforts to decarbonize the economy through policies like renewable energy deployment that are both popular and effective in march the free press published a story on the environmental protection agencys efforts to claw back 20 billion of congressionally appropriated climate funds titled a 20 billion slush fundpaid by you to progressive nonprofits the piece largely represents the position of epa administrator lee zeldin that the funds were somehow fraudulent it also pushes the fox news narrative that the funding is a slush fund for the left including democratic politicians that was rushed out the door before bidens term ended like gold bars tossed off the titanic but as the new york times reported the climate funds were not hastily approved as biden left office the funding was legally appropriated through the inflation reduction act passed by congress in 2022 and grants were awarded through established procedures with public announcements made months before the election additionally as the washington post also reported a lawyer for the epa staffer who appeared in the video has since said he was not referring to the 20 billion grant program the former employee had nothing to do with the evaluation and selection of the recipients said a former epa official briefed on the matter these facts were largely absent from the free press piece in 2024 the free press published a contrarian piece by a retired sustainability influencer who is also the socialmedia editor for the outlet i helped make standing rock go viral now i regret it the author lamented that as an early socialmedia influencer she presented the nativeamericanled protest against an oil pipeline as black and white or goodversusevil she claimed her opinion on the dakota access pipeline and fossil fuels changed after she began reading books and news sources that strayed from the progressive party line titles like unsettled by steven koonin apocalypse never by michael shellenberger and fossil future by alex epstein notably the titles that she cited and their authors koonin shellenberger and epstein frequently appear across rightwing media to downplay the climate crisis disparage renewable energy andor promote fossil fuel use similarly in 2023 a former extinction rebellion uk member penned a piece for the free press climate activism has a cult problem in which the author argued that the climateaction organisation known for controversial direct actions is run by a cult leader the piece was published at a time when rightwing media hostility against climate activists was at a fever pitch and some rightwing media personalities were cheering on calls for violence against climate groups conservative journalists like bret baier could undermine cbs leadership in climate coverage for at least the last four years cbs has led its broadcast counterparts in the volume of climate coverage in 2024 the network accounted for 50 of total broadcasttv news climate reporting 381 minutes of 771 minutes across all three national broadcast networks the network also led in the number of climate scientist guest appearances it aired and the number of segments it ran that discussed climate solutions meanwhile fox newss flagship special report anchored by bret baier has repeatedly softened or distorted the stakes of global warming and climate action from 2009 through may 2021 more than 87 of its climate segments contained misinformation or misleading narratives while americans may be changing how they consume the news legacy media and broadcast journalism at networks like cbs still matter as the entire media landscape still relies on traditional journalism as part of the beginning of the information food chain this includes how anchors report on extreme weather events climate action and scientific reports and findings if cbs under weiss approaches this reporting like the outlet she founded or like the anchor she seeks to poach the network will risk becoming another cog in the machinery of climate denial and delay think again newsrewind",

is elected as westlands inaugural mp and praises hokitika in his speech on april 12 shepards gaol and asylum is completed and anna and emery are transferred there on april 16 francis carver and lydia wells are married and the next day he paid off his creditors with the cash he received from the garrity group devlin only lets tauwahare in to see staines despite many visitors asking for an audience staines seems to have only blurry memories of his ordeal which appear blended with annas experiences in the 3rd week of april the west coast times published the charges against emery staines and anna wetherell devlin asks moody to be annas lawyer and save her from a disastrous supreme court trial since she is being tried for forgery and for assault shooting the bullet that ended up in staines shoulder if she is not convicted on those two charges shepard is likely to pursue claims of insanity even staines thinks anna may be insane and likes it moody says he will do it that is if both sides of the story agree on april 27 moody prepares for court the plaintiffs witness list for annas trial includes pritchard gascoigne devlin and shepard the witnesses for the staines trial are mannering long quee lwenthal clinch nilssen frost lydia carver and francis carver justice kemp instructs the lawyers on how to refer to annas profession in a respectful way and to prepare for the cases to be viewed as interdependent anna will not be sentenced until staines has been tried when the charges are read anna pleads not guilty broham the plaintiffs lawyer makes a lengthy opening statement about annas crimes and dependency on opium questioning her character and casting her as a danger to the community moody uses his opening statement to point out that anna is now sober and to remind the court that they are only to consider whether anna committed the crimes and not to judge her character broham questions anna about her employment gaps which point to her relying on the inheritance she allegedly forged anna testifies to all the events from her perspective attempting to explain her experiences with the misfiring gun and disappearing bullet as well as her accidental opium overdose symptoms moody crossexamines anna about her lack of acquaintance with george shepard who considers her insane despite their dearth of interactions their connection is ah sook which could shed light on shepards vendetta against anna witnesses are called next pritchard testifies and backs up annas story about the gun cartridge and her lack of opium use gascoigne also confirms annas story about the missing bullet and leaves the door open on whether staines could have been nearby devlin explains how he discovered the unsigned deed of gift and testifies in annas favor he gives details about the deeds signature and shepards opportunities to interact with it speaks to annas strength of character and asserts that she is completely sane expert testimonies are given by doctors and police inspectors george shepard testifies last speaking to annas apparent insanity and her forgery of staines signature since moody already introduced annas mental state and shepards grudge against her the insanity accusations come off as petty moody is also able to point out that someone other than anna eg shepard may have forged the signature in order to set her up since she cannot read or write venus is a morning star 27 april 1865 anna disembarks from the fortunate wind looking to start a new life but things do not go smoothly first her trunk is mixed up with another womans then she cannot catch sight of the friendly boy that had been so kind to her aboard the ship as she is gathering herself she is approached by mrs wells who says she is looking for her 19yearold second cousin who was supposed to arrive on this ship anna comforts mrs wells by suggesting that perhaps this girl elizabeth mackay couldnt make the voyage at the last minute but that all may still be well mrs wells is aghast that anna is planning to board at mrs pennistons lodging house because she considers it the very lowest in the city she offers to let anna take elizabeths spot prepaid of course and to help her find employment at a hotel based on annas good references she leads anna away while the young porter smirks exalted in aries 27 april 1866 staines trial begins and he pleads guilty to all charges broham gives another longwinded opening statement that seeks to discredit staines character while moodys opening statement points out that staines knows he caused a lot of trouble and wishes to pay his debts staines testifies that the gold came from the aurora when he owned it mr quee retorted it and staines himself buried it in the arahura because it is maori land and cannot be prospected he intended to split the bonanza with anna as a gift because he didnt think francis carver deserved his 50 share in the claim staines assumes crosbie wells dug up the gold himself but realized he couldnt pass it off as his own find because it was already engraved with the name aurora staines explains his long absence as an addiction to opium on the night he and anna fell in love he sampled some from her pipe and was so desperate for more that when she left he went straight to ah sooks opium den and spent weeks there when he woke up to find ah sook and the opium gone one day he panicked and decided to steal annas stash of the drug but got caught in her room he had to hide behind the drapes where he silently endured the gunshot from the misfired pistol so desperate was he to get her opium that he dared not move or call out he trusts that anna did not know he was there because he loves her when moody crossexamines him staines testifies that he developed a low opinion of francis carver because of how he beat anna and caused her baby to die in utero he had met carver the very first day off the boat and ever since he had regretted their association because of how carver and lydia wells worked together to swindle people staines explained that when he saw what had happened to anna he informed crosbie wells since it was his baby and shared his plan to give carvers share of the gold to anna the document was drawn up but staines was too drunk to remember why he didnt sign right away mannering quee lowenthal clinch nilssen and frost all testify about their knowledge of the events but they leave out annas gowns lined with gold the godspeed and their meeting at the crown hotel lydia carver testifies next she explains that emery staines was the subject of her seance because she knew it would make her money since his disappearance was causing such a stir she denies knowing anything about the aurora gold and the business of her late husband she was informed of his death by francis carver and rushed to hokitika but didnt find out about his estate until she arrived lydia explains that she and crosbie were estranged because he cheated on her with anna wetherell before he left for hokitika moody crossexamines her about how crosbie wells sent his first bonanza back to dunedin via private escort where she received it in an office safe she installed the safe at home and left the gold inside to wait for the best time to sell it was stolen she claims and says the theft wasnt discovered until crosbie returned home a year later in april or may 1865 mr carver testifies next describing how he sponsored emery staines to get him set up on the aurora claim in exchange for the 50 stake he said he was unaware that staines had falsified his reports and hidden the bonanza until the paper published the details he explains his encounter with anna as nothing more than a slap in the face for her rudeness when he asked for directions to find crosbie wells who he had a decent relationship with moody crossexamines him and carver explains how he knew the wellss for a long time and had hoped to marry lydia but was sent to prison and she married crosbie instead after being released he worked on the godspeed for a year before becoming its captain crosbie purchased the barque and entrusted the deed of sale to carver right before he moved to the arahura valley so carver could act as his proxy moody asks how wells could have purchased the ship without using the gold in the safe and points out that while wells didnt make out very well from the events in question carver did balfour testifies first for the defense he describes the loss of the lauderback crate and how it turned up on the godspeed when it wrecked carver knew about the crate being added to the cargo but was upset to see it was the wrong crate he was looking for a lost crate from danforth shipping not this one from balfour shipping next lauderback is questioned about the godspeed which he sold to carver in may 1865 carver forged the bill of sale signing as crosbie c francis wells lauderback says the sale was presented as blackmail for the affair he and lydia had been entangled in he explains the smuggling carver was doing with lauderbacks crates of lydias dresses transported by danforth shipping lauderback tells of crosbie wells letter passing it off as just a voter reaching out to their representative which made it clear that he knew nothing of the politicians affair with lauderback tipping him off to carvers real identity the signature on the letter matches exactly the signature on the deed of gift for anna wetherell as well as the signature on mr wells marriage certificate but not the signature on the bill of sale for the godspeed it appears that carver stole the godspeed as well as thousands of pounds presumably with lydia wells help a general uproar ensues as broham calls for a recess justice kemp calls broham and moody to his office and has everyone held in custody while court is adjourned the house of many wishes 27 april 1865 lydia takes anna to her boardinghouse and gets her settled in with a hot bath and generous lunch she has a luxurious room with a large bed all set up with annas trunk already installed lydia encourages anna to use whatever she wants in the room while she is out taking care of some appointments while lydia is gone crosbie wells comes into the house and lets anna in on the secret lydia made up the story of her second cousin elizabeth mackay to lure anna back to the house and make her indebted to the mistress lydia herself this is a common trick lydia pulls he explains then he offers anna a chestnutsized nugget of gold if shell keep him company while they wait for lydia to come back itll help anna get ahead of her debts crux 27 april 1866 tauwhare watches the bailiff and sergeant drake load francis carver now under arrest into the wagon to be taken to seaview tauwhare declines the offer of riding along but makes note of the latch on the wagon justice kemp delivers the verdicts emery stains has shown contrition and respect by pleading guilty and conducting himself modestly in court however his charges are serious and he is sentenced to nine months imprisonment with labor he accepts this without reaction anna is acquitted of all charges because there is a lack of evidence to prove her guilt and she is to be released immediately just then a loud bang is heard from outside and sgt drake runs in to announce that carver is dead someone must have opened the wagon door while drake wasnt paying attention and they bashed carvers head in combust 27 april 1865 lydia wells is out of the house because she tells fortunes as a side business she is just finishing with the goldenhaired boy from the ship when francis carver comes in she sends the boy to fetch her some food so she can talk to carver alone he is excited to tell her that lauderback is on his way and will arrive in three weeks at which point they can finally get him alone lydia expresses pity for him because although he is a coward and rich he is ashamed of his past and she admits theyve set him up carver also wants to be sure that crosbie wells isnt going to show up unannounced he suggests lydia send him some liquor to keep him out of the picture so he doesnt actually meet lauderback and ruin their plans the boy returns and lydia says goodbye reminding him that he is about to become excessively rich carver asks his name because the boy has been taught to give false names to whores and fortune tellers and he introduces himself as emery staines mercury sets 27 april 1866 adrian moody the drunkard father of our own walter moody arrives in hokitika he passes a piece of paper to the postmaster to deliver to walter it is a letter that details his history adrian was in a lot of debt and decided to go with walters brother frederick to the gold fields to strike it rich he left the last of his savings with piers howland to be delivered to mrs moody but howland stole it considering his wife abandoned since he was already too far away to fix things adrian continued on his journey with frederick they finally had luck seven months ago upon the discovery of a large gold nugget frederick wanted to write walter and mrs moody to reunite the family and urged his father to stop his excessive drinking they argued and parted on bad terms and are now estranged he has no idea where frederick might be adrian is ashamed of many things but never of walter he has taken a vow of temperance and is proud that his sons have turned out better than himself he hopes they can reunite now that he is sober and would be glad of even a brief reply from walter frost brings staines an itemized list of his expenses totalling five hundred pounds in legal fees plus damages in the tens to hundreds he hopes staines will also cover annas debt to mannering and give mr quee passage home plus a bonus of 768 shillings a number significant to him for unknown reasons frost wishes to have staines cover the 30 pounds he was given by clinch and promises to pay it back staines agrees to it all moody packs and leaves the crown for the last time his trunk and any mail he receives while gone will be stored at clarks warehouse as he walks out towards the coast moody meets up with an irishman named paddy ryan and they strike up a conversation about home and personal histories moody agrees to share his story with paddys reassurance that it doesnt need to be the truth as long as its a good tale",

    "bryan andrew has a few words to say about the november 2025 election results",
    "an election is a formal group decisionmaking process whereby a population chooses an individual or multiple individuals to hold public office elections have been the usual mechanism by which modern representative democracy has operated since the 17th century elections may fill offices in the legislature sometimes in the executive and judiciary and for regional and local government such as cities or towns this process is also used in many other standardized associations public businesses and organizations from clubs to voluntary association and corporations the global use of elections as a tool for selecting representatives in modern representative democracies is in contrast with the practice in the democratic archetype ancient athens where the elections were considered an oligarchic institution and most political offices were filled using allotment which is also known as sortition by which office holders were chosen by lot electoral reform describes the process of introducing fair electoral systems where they are not in place or improving the fairness or effectiveness of existing systems psephology is the study of results and other statistics relating to elections especially with a view to predicting future results election is the fact of electing or being elected to elect means to select or to nominate and so sometimes other forms of ballot such as referendums are referred to as elections especially in the united states history elections were used as early in history as ancient greece and ancient rome and throughout the medieval period to select rulers such as the holy roman emperor see imperial election and the pope see papal election the pala king gopala ruled c 750s 770s ce in early medieval bengal was elected by a group of feudal chieftains such elections were quite common in contemporary societies of the region in the chola empire around 920 ce in uthiramerur in presentday tamil nadu palm leaves were used for selecting the village committee members the leaves with candidate names written on them were put inside a mud pot to select the committee members a young boy was asked to take out as many leaves as the number of positions available this was known as the kudavolai system the first recorded popular elections of officials to public office by majority vote where all citizens were eligible both to vote and to hold public office date back to the ephors of sparta in 754 bc under the mixed government of the spartan constitution athenian democratic elections where all citizens could hold public office were not introduced for another 247 years until the reforms of cleisthenes under the earlier solonian constitution c 574 bc all athenian citizens were eligible to vote in the popular assemblies on matters of law and policy and as jurors but only the three highest classes of citizens could vote in elections nor were the lowest of the four classes of athenian citizens as defined by the extent of their wealth and property rather than by birth eligible to hold public office through the reforms of solon the spartan election of the ephors therefore also predates the reforms of solon in athens by approximately 180 years questions of suffrage especially suffrage for minority groups have dominated the history of elections males the dominant cultural group in north america and europe often dominated the electorate and continue to do so in many countries early elections in countries such as the united kingdom and the united states were dominated by landed or ruling class males by 1920 all western european and north american democracies had universal adult male suffrage except switzerland and many countries began to consider womens suffrage despite legally mandated universal suffrage for adult males political barriers were sometimes erected to prevent fair access to elections see civil rights movement contexts elections are held in a variety of political organizational and corporate settings many countries hold elections to select people to serve in their governments but other types of organizations hold elections as well for example many corporations hold elections among shareholders to select a board of directors and these elections may be mandated by corporate law in many places an election to the government is usually a competition among people who have already won a primary election within a political party elections within corporations and other organizations often use procedures and rules that are similar to those of governmental elections electorate suffrage the question of who may vote is a central issue in elections the electorate does not generally include the entire population for example many countries prohibit those who are under the age of majority from voting all jurisdictions require a minimum age for voting in australia aboriginal people were not given the right to vote until 1962 see 1967 referendum entry and in 2010 the federal government removed the rights of prisoners serving for three years or more to vote a large proportion of whom were aboriginal australians suffrage is typically only for citizens of the country though further limits may be imposed in the european union one can vote in municipal elections if one lives in the municipality and is an eu citizen the nationality of the country of residence is not required in some countries voting is required by law eligible voters may be subject to punitive measures such as a fine for not casting a vote in western australia the penalty for a first time offender failing to vote is a 2000 fine which increases to 5000 if the offender refused to vote prior voting population historically the size of eligible voters the electorate was small having the size of groups or communities of privileged men like aristocrats and men of a city citizens with the growth of the number of people with bourgeois citizen rights outside of cities expanding the term citizen the electorates grew to numbers beyond the thousands elections with an electorate in the hundred thousands appeared in the final decades of the roman republic by extending voting rights to citizens outside of rome with the lex julia of 90 bc reaching an electorate of 910000 and estimated voter turnout of maximum 10 in 70 bc only again comparable in size to the first elections of the united states at the same time the kingdom of great britain had in 1780 about 214000 eligible voters 3 of the whole population naturalization can reshape the electorate of a country candidates a representative democracy requires a procedure to govern nomination for political office in many cases nomination for office is mediated through preselection processes in organized political parties nonpartisan systems tend to be different from partisan systems as concerns nominations in a direct democracy one type of nonpartisan democracy any eligible person can be nominated although elections were used in ancient athens in rome and in the selection of popes and holy roman emperors the origins of elections in the contemporary world lie in the gradual emergence of representative government in europe and north america beginning in the 17th century in some systems no nominations take place at all with voters free to choose any person at the time of votingwith some possible exceptions such as through a minimum age requirementin the jurisdiction in such cases it is not required or even possible that the members of the electorate be familiar with all of the eligible persons though such systems may involve indirect elections at larger geographic levels to ensure that some firsthand familiarity among potential electees can exist at these levels ie among the elected delegates systems electoral systems are the detailed constitutional arrangements and voting systems that convert the vote into a political decision the first step is for voters to cast the ballots which may be simple singlechoice ballots but other types such as multiple choice or ranked ballots may also be used then the votes are tallied for which various vote counting systems may be used and the voting system then determines the result on the basis of the tally most systems can be categorized as either proportional majoritarian or mixed among the proportional systems the most commonly used are partylist proportional representation list pr systems among majoritarian are firstpastthepost electoral system single winner plurality voting and different methods of majority voting such as the widely used tworound system mixed systems combine elements of both proportional and majoritarian methods with some typically producing results closer to the former mixedmember proportional or the other eg parallel voting many countries have growing electoral reform movements which advocate systems such as approval voting single transferable vote instant runoff voting or a condorcet method these methods are also gaining popularity for lesser elections in some countries where more important elections still use more traditional counting methods while openness and accountability are usually considered cornerstones of a democratic system the act of casting a vote and the content of a voters ballot are usually an important exception the secret ballot is a relatively modern development but it is now considered crucial in most free and fair elections as it limits the effectiveness of intimidation campaigns when elections are called politicians and their supporters attempt to influence policy by competing directly for the votes of constituents in what are called campaigns supporters for a campaign can be either formally organized or loosely affiliated and frequently utilize campaign advertising it is common for political scientists to attempt to predict elections via political forecasting methods the most expensive election campaign included us7 billion spent on the 2012 united states presidential election and is followed by the us5 billion spent on the 2014 indian general election timing the nature of democracy is that elected officials are accountable to the people and they must return to the voters at prescribed intervals to seek their mandate to continue in office for that reason most democratic constitutions provide that elections are held at fixed regular intervals in the united states elections for public offices are typically held between every two and six years in most states and at the federal level with exceptions for elected judicial positions that may have longer terms of office there is a variety of schedules for example presidents the president of ireland is elected every seven years the president of russia and the president of finland every six years the president of france every five years president of the united states every four years predetermined or fixed election dates have the advantage of fairness and predictability they tend to greatly lengthen campaigns and make dissolving the legislature parliamentary system more problematic if the date should happen to fall at a time when dissolution is inconvenient eg when war breaks out other states eg the united kingdom only set maximum time in office and the executive decides exactly when within that limit it will actually go to the polls in practice this means the government remains in power for close to its full term and chooses an election date it calculates to be in its best interests unless something special happens such as a motion of noconfidence this calculation depends on a number of variables such as its performance in opinion polls and the size of its majority postponing elections beyond the full term has been associated with democratic backsliding snap elections are early elections before the full term of office rolling elections are elections in which all representatives in a body are elected but these elections are spread over a period of time rather than all at once examples are the presidential primaries in the united states elections to the european parliament where due to differing election laws in each member state elections are held on different days of the same week and due to logistics general elections in lebanon and india the voting procedure in the legislative assemblies of the roman republic are also a classical example in rolling elections voters have information about previous voters choices while in the first elections there may be plenty of hopeful candidates in the last rounds consensus on one winner is generally achieved in todays context of rapid communication candidates can put disproportionate resources into competing strongly in the first few stages because those stages affect the reaction of latter stages undemocratic or unfair in many of the countries with weak rule of law the most common reason why elections do not meet international standards of being free and fair is interference from the incumbent government dictators may use the powers of the executive police martial law censorship physical implementation of the election mechanism etc to remain in power despite popular opinion in favour of removal members of a particular faction in a legislature may use the power of the majority or supermajority passing criminal laws and defining the electoral mechanisms including eligibility and district boundaries to prevent the balance of power in the body from shifting to a rival faction due to an election nongovernmental entities can also interfere with elections through physical force verbal intimidation or fraud which can result in improper casting or counting of votes monitoring for and minimizing electoral fraud is also an ongoing task in countries with strong traditions of free and fair elections problems that prevent an election from being free and fair take various forms lack of open political debate or an informed electorate the electorate may be poorly informed about issues or candidates due to lack of freedom of the press lack of objectivity in the press due to state or corporate control or lack of access to news and political media freedom of speech may be curtailed by the state favouring certain viewpoints or state propaganda scheduling frequent elections can also lead to voter fatigue violation of political egalitarianism gerrymandering wasted votes and manipulating electoral thresholds can prevent that all votes count equally interference with campaigns exclusion of opposition candidates from eligibility for office needlessly high nomination rules on who may be a candidate are some of the ways the structure of an election can be changed to favour a specific faction or candidate those in power may arrest or assassinate candidates suppress or even criminalize campaigning close campaign headquarters harass or beat campaign workers or intimidate voters with violence foreign electoral intervention can also occur with the united states interfering between 1946 and 2000 in 81 elections and russia or the soviet union in 36 in 2018 the most intense interventions utilizing false information were by china in taiwan and by russia in latvia the next highest levels were in bahrain qatar and hungary tampering with mechanisms this can include falsifying voter instructions violation of the secret ballot ballot stuffing tampering with voting machines destruction of legitimately cast ballots voter suppression voter registration fraud failure to validate voter residency fraudulent tabulation of results and use of physical force or verbal intimation at polling places other examples include persuading candidates not to run such as through blackmailing bribery intimidation or physical violence shams a sham election or show election is an election that is held purely for show that is without any significant political choice or real impact on the results of the election sham elections are a common event in dictatorial regimes that feel the need to feign the appearance of public legitimacy published results usually show high voter turnout and high support typically at least 80 and close to 100 in many cases for the prescribed candidates or for the referendum choice that favours the political party in power dictatorial regimes can also organize sham elections with results simulating those that might be achieved in democratic countries sometimes only one governmentapproved candidate is allowed to run in sham elections with no opposition candidates allowed or opposition candidates are arrested on false charges or even without any charges before the election to prevent them from running ballots may contain only one yes option or in the case of a simple yes or no question security forces often persecute people who pick no thus encouraging them to pick the yes option in other cases those who vote receive stamps in their passport for doing so while those who did not vote and thus do not receive stamps are persecuted as enemies of the people sham elections can sometimes backfire against the party in power especially if the regime believes they are popular enough to win without coercion fraud or suppressing the opposition the most famous example of this was the 1990 myanmar general election in which the governmentsponsored national unity party suffered a landslide defeat by the opposition national league for democracy and consequently the results were annulled aristocratic some scholars argue that the predominance of elections in modern liberal democracies masks the fact that they are actually aristocratic selection mechanisms that deny each citizen an equal chance of holding public office such views were expressed as early as the time of ancient greece by aristotle according to french political scientist bernard manin the inegalitarian nature of elections stems from four factors the unequal treatment of candidates by voters the distinction of candidates required by choice the cognitive advantage conferred by salience and the costs of disseminating information these four factors result in the evaluation of candidates based on voters partial standards of quality and social saliency for example skin colour and good looks this leads to selfselection biases in candidate pools due to unobjective standards of treatment by voters and the costs barriers to entry associated with raising ones political profile ultimately the result is the election of candidates who are superior whether in actuality or as perceived within a cultural context and objectively unlike the voters they are supposed to represent evidence suggests that the concept of electing representatives was originally conceived to be different from democracy prior to the 18th century some societies in western europe used sortition as a means to select rulers a method which allowed regular citizens to exercise power in keeping with understandings of democracy at the time the idea of what constituted a legitimate government shifted in the 18th century to include consent especially with the rise of the enlightenment from this point onward sortition fell out of favor as a mechanism for selecting rulers on the other hand elections began to be seen as a way for the masses to express popular consent repeatedly resulting in the triumph of the electoral process until the present day this conceptual misunderstanding of elections as open and egalitarian when they are not innately so may thus be a root cause of the problems in contemporary governance those in favor of this view argue that the modern system of elections was never meant to give ordinary citizens the chance to exercise power merely privileging their right to consent to those who rule th",
