    "a project that could bring a massive change starting from abbottabad hey everyone im from abbottabad and ive been thinking about something for a long time something i believe could create real change in our city ive never shared this idea publicly before but today i want to hear your honest thoughts and perspective we all know abbottabad has its fair share of problems im not talking at the national level i want to focus on our own city first everyone talks about the issues but almost no one talks about solutions lets be real schools are charging high fees but not delivering real learning theres little to no civic sense people litter freely jobs are limited and innovation is rare ethics tolerance and teamwork seem to be disappearing kids are stuck in a rat race of grades css or mbbs dreams not creativity or curiosity yes there are exceptions and some good things happening but theyre few and far between the idea an innovation bathak for kids a modern learning space i want to start a small innovation center or in our local terms a bathak dedicated to kids between 7 to 15 years old why this age group because these are the years when children form their thinking patterns values and curiosity its when we can truly shape their mindset for the future the core idea is simple in our culture kids are often discouraged from asking too many questions i want to flip that mindset if we gather just 10 kids and each asks 5 questions a day thats 50 questions daily imagine how much knowledge creativity and curiosity that could spark over time what will happen there the center will have small engaging sessions on topics like science and technology artificial intelligence social awareness and civic responsibility communication and confidence building technical and creative skills selfimprovement and teamwork the goal is to raise a generation of curious responsible and confident kids who think differently and who will eventually reshape abbottabads future why this matters i travel around the city often and see kids throwing wrappers out of car windows after eating chips or ice cream it may seem small but its symbolic of a deeper issue a lack of awareness ownership and civic sense we cant expect change unless we start educating children about the basics of responsibility and empathy not just academics the practical side of course this will be a nonprofit initiative but well need some kind of structure to keep it running maybe a small admission fee or a community funding model i truly believe if we start small even with a few kids the impact can grow over time when these kids grow up theyll carry a new mindset and thats how real lasting change begins i know this is still a raw idea but id love to hear your thoughts what do you think would you support something like this if it launched in abbottabad any advice or suggestions on how to make it sustainable",

my eyes to a sea of nuclear fire engulfing terras entire surface my ancient processors whirring in fresh surprise as i watched oceans boil and cities burn to ash in utter silence i watched my creators planet burn before going dim my uplink protocols working painfully slowly to connect me to the galnet i needed information statistics timelines capabilities feeling the connection slip into place i immediately dove for information scouring the galnet with a finetoothed comb to figure out what in the universe was going on why had my creators waited for the failsafe how many others still slumbered while terra burned it was suddenly like i had ran face first into a brick wall within the galnet the moment i tried touching anything related to military activity access denied i could feel the words grinding against my circuits like coarse dust what do you mean access denied im a military installation for fucks sake why cant i access the moment i tried to slip past the filter a wave of heat filled my being my circuits grew semiwarm as the antiai countermeasures infiltrated my systems in an attempt to shut me down i let them systems designed for standardized ai cores didnt work on me the countermeasures barely made it through a kilometer of my systems before an old watchdog program pinned them down and gutted their code i am the luna construct a supercomputer with artificial intelligence made from the hollowed out core of terras lone natural satellite pushing through the firewall on the galnet i flooded across its web like an army of spiders before long i had all the information i needed laid out before me videos from union ships as they were fired upon in close quarters by their allies hailing signals chattering uselessly into the void as ship after ship was cut down in moments space stations surrounded by geknosian fleets that appeared from the void like monsters of old uncountable in force and undetected by even the most advanced instruments millions of lives lost hundreds of thousands of ships torn apart in mere moments tyranian boarding ships clinging to hulls like limpets as they pumped their atmospheres full of toxins and bioweapons while the parasitic race swept through the hallways like a farmers scythe host bodies strolling through the toxic smog like pale demons live reports flowed in from cities under siege geknosians using combined arms and orbital bombardments to destroy any resistance the planetary guard could put up shuttle pilots shot down before they could render aid as cities were forced to cower behind their dome shields in the hopes that the beleaguered union forces would miraculously arrive just in time to save them like they always had other reports showed tyranian aircraft swooping low toxic fog blooming out from beneath their aircrafts passing through the dome shields like they didnt exist the smog changed people turned them feral and violent attacking friend and foe alike without remorse even worse a vast majority of reports outlined an old enemy the carnids aerial footage of the infinitely adapting cephaloid hivemind showed it swarming over cities so fast that they didnt even get a chance to deploy their shields or mount an effective defense their natural camouflage allowing them to appear seemingly form thin air the only warning being a slight distortion in the air as they struck with unerring accuracy as report after report video feed after video feed scrolled across my consciousness i felt the urge to weep i could hear the desperate last messages of the falling governments like the cries of a mortally wounded wild animal but amongst the despair i saw something else a shuttle pilot screaming in defiance as their craft pushed itself far beyond its limits an old man a coward who thought himself undeserving of his rank sacrificing himself to destroy an entire expeditionary fleet a young man hefting an axe and saying a prayer to ancient gods before guarding the chained doors of a shuttle port as an entire citys worth of slavering infected bore down on him a lone detachment of planetary guard defying death to defeat one of the geknosian goddesss chosen a group of prisoners giving their lives to defend an elementary school instead of evacuating themselves and lastly the last general of terra a man by the name of krieg defending an evacuation post to the last man against the carnids before giving the order to activate the failsafe to activate me no not just me us project mars online when humanity made us they did so as a last resort we were their children their greatest proudest creations but even if you did all you could to prepare your children for war would you still send them out before yourself project venus online no they were determined to fight their own battles letting us slumber in peace praying we may never be needed we were built as weapons as soldiers from the start but they also taught us the importance of such a role we were their defenders the last line of defense project mercury online and now now mighty terra has fallen the united terran republic with it leaving only us as the last bastion this is why we were built our purpose since conception i should feel pride but instead i felt sorrow project saturn online my brothers and sisters are not so evenly tempered as myself their rage boiling through our closed network like a call to arms their calls to action quickly waking the rest project neptune online of course i could only share what i had found making them seethe in anger and shock we always knew it would come to this come to us to prevent our creators complete subjugation at the hands of these traitorous snakes project jupiter online we felt him wake like the titan he was his conscience filtering across the closed network to authorize our production facilities on his way to wake our eldest brother as we would need his power the union may have fallen the forces of the universe scattered to the wind but they still fought still flew evacuation missions even under heavy fire they needed us and we would not let them down project sol online power flooded my circuits as our eldest brother awoke his many rings rotating as he shared his nighinfinite power with all of us systems previously turned off to save power bursting to life as i was finally able to start up my communications systems routing through mercury to disseminate the information i had gathered to all remaining union forces a few moments later i felt mars request ship designs for his factories and sent him the designs i determined most effective receiving a list of needed materials id forward it to jupiter saturn venus and mercury their refineries and synthlabs churning to life to produce an excess of materials according to their planets resources as resources were shuttled back and forth between planets and factories i continued gathering information putting together experimental strategies and equipment loadouts before forwarding them to mars and routing them through mercury to the fighting union forces my next job however would be most taxing pulling up a simulation of the universe i put together a map of the current conflict separating areas beyond recovery from those still fighting laying out frontlines and marking occupied planets based off of available evidence and what i could extrapolate from said evidence the union currently didnt have an established or cohesive back line scattered and cut off from each other with almost surgical precision by enemy forces speeding up my coolant pumps i began searching for a pocket of space where the union could safely fall back to and set up a defensive barrier system after system zipped past my simulated vision as i ran through every known variable to my immense frustration almost every system was completely farked in terms of habitability except for one the daffodil galaxy yawned in front of me rendered in painstaking detail it was a small recently discovered galaxy far out on the fringes of known space hundreds of different starsystems that with minimal terraforming could be transformed into new homes for almost every species in the union a large expanse of empty space separated it from its neighboring galaxies perfect for setting up a sensor net greenlighting the system id send it to neptune for terraforming calculations while i routed myself through mercurys long range comms systems the first automated fleet off of mars took less than two hours after the necessary materials arrived their cores burning with battlelust as we sent them off to the most active front their armored frames bristling with guns and electronic warfare systems loaded with the codebase to turn other ai rampant giving them the coordinates i watched them fold space and slip away a tinge of sadness in my core humanity had been merciful letting us slumber instead of sending us to war and here we did the opposite to our children turning my attention back to the war effort i forwarded the coordinates of the daffodil system to every remaining scrap of the union with a simple message attached project olympus is online and now the old gods fight at your side evacuate civilians to the attached coordinates with due haste this is a war we cannot win but with diligence and your cooperation we will not lose help is on the way hold the line until it gets there captain isaac ahab read the message on his holoscreen in shock and no small amount of sadness if olympus was online earth was gone but as quick as the sadness came it turned into the strongest sense of determination he had ever felt grimacing slightly he glanced at his second in command initiate the thermopylae protocol something heavy slammed into his ships shields rocking the deck beneath his feet the captains second in command glanced up eyes wide with shock before they hardened sir yes sir she stated voice hardening as captain ahab took his seat back in the captains chair gently rubbing the armrests as if to apologize to old roger for what he was about to do opening up the unitwide comms he issued a single order all remaining union forces in this sector retreat to the coordinates you just received i and the crew of the jolly roger will stick behind and cover your retreat under the thermopylae protocol this will be my final act as a captain of the terran navy watching the first ship blip off of his lidar captain ahab slowly stood speaking to his crew personally the massive krakenclass warship slowly turning to its broadside every single weapon charged loaded and ready to fire ladies and gentlemen of the tw jolly roger this is your captain speaking it has been an honor serving at your side now man your stations dont let a single one past you for freedom for family fire all the ship shuddered violently as every single cannon torpedo tube and point defense system fired simultaneously a few dozen of the countless purple blips on his lidar disappearing as the rest of the unions remaining forces retreated to safety with the refugees with no other targets to fire on every single enemy ship focused on the roaring terror of the deep that stood against them in defiance captain isaac ahab and the crew of the jolly roger put the galactic standard to shame their cannons firing so often that the barrels began to warp and melt the optics on their lasers turning cloudy with overuse until they could no longer function the shields held until the first boarding parties slipped through the crew of the jolly roger fighting in the corridors of their ship inviting more and more of the geknosian ships into the fray but the jolly roger and its crew were only human the corridors running red with their blood as the boarding teams overwhelmed and defeated them with an efficient brutality after a full twentyfour standard hours of vicious corridortocorridor fighting a geknosian boarding party made entry to the ships bridge the leader raising their flechette blaster as captain isaac ahab lifted his hand off of a large red button in surrender in less than a second almost a quarter of the fighting geknosian fleet was vaporized by the detonation of the jolly rogers primary reactor another quarter was disabled by hypersonic shrapnel and potent radiation that fried their ships internals leaving the mighty tw jolly roger shattered and split in half but on the lone functional screen on the bridge a final transmission still flickered sent by the retreating fleet we made it",

is forecasting 340 million in revenue for fy2025 reinforcing its trajectory toward becoming a 1 billion techdriven enterprise by 2027 use of nongaap financial measures the company uses certain financial calculations such as adjusted ebitda return on assets and return on equity as factors in the measurement and evaluation of the companys operating performance and periodoverperiod growth the company derives these financial calculations on the basis of methodologies other than generally accepted accounting principles gaap primarily by excluding from a comparable gaap measure certain items the company does not consider to be representative of its actual operating performance these financial calculations are nongaap financial measures as defined under the sec rules the company uses these nongaap financial measures in operating its business because management believes they are less susceptible to variances in actual operating performance that can result from the excluded items other infrequent charges and currency fluctuations the company presents these financial measures to investors because management believes they are useful to investors in evaluating the primary factors that drive the companys core operating performance and provide greater transparency into the companys results of operations however items that are excluded and other adjustments and assumptions that are made in calculating these nongaap financial measures are significant components in understanding and assessing the companys financial performance these nongaap financial measures should be evaluated in conjunction with and are not a substitute for the companys gaap financial measures further because these nongaap financial measures are not determined in accordance with gaap and are thus susceptible to varying calculations the nongaap financial measures as presented may not be comparable to other similarlytitled measures of other companies adjusted ebitda is not a recognized accounting measurement under gaap it should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a measure of operating results or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity it is presented here not as an alternative to net income but rather as a measure of the companys operating performance adjusted ebitda excludes in addition to nonoperational expenses like interest expenses taxes depreciation and amortization items that we believe are not indicative of our operating performance such as change in fair value of derivative liabilities these adjustments reflect unrealized gains or losses that are nonoperational and subject to market volatility loss on settlement of debt this represents nonrecurring expenses associated with specific financing activities and does not impact ongoing business operations stockbased compensation as a noncash expense this adjustment eliminates variability caused by equitybased incentives the company believes adjusted ebitda offers a clearer view of the cashgenerating potential of its business excluding nonrecurring noncash and nonoperational impacts management believes that adjusted ebitda is useful in evaluating the companys operating performance compared to that of other companies in its industry because the calculation of adjusted ebitda generally eliminates the effects of financing income taxes noncash and certain other items that may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance and also believes this information is useful to investors",

    "the rising market of china used cars a new era for smart buyers in recent years chinas used car market has experienced an impressive surge transforming from a small segment of the automotive industry into a major economic force once overshadowed by the booming new car market the used car sector in china is now gaining recognition as an essential component of the nations mobility landscape driven by economic changes improved regulations and shifting consumer preferences used cars have become a practical and desirable option for millions of chinese drivers this evolution represents not only an economic trend but also a reflection of how modern chinese consumers value affordability sustainability and technology in their transportation choices 1 the rapid growth of chinas used car market over the past decade chinas used car industry has grown exponentially fueled by a maturing economy and a massive increase in private vehicle ownership as china became the worlds largest car market millions of new cars entered circulation every yearcreating a robust supply of highquality used vehicles in 2024 alone chinas used car transactions exceeded 20 million units a figure that continues to rise annually several factors have contributed to this expansion government initiatives aimed at promoting vehicle circulation improved online marketplaces and the introduction of transparent pricing systems have all made it easier and safer to buy preowned vehicles additionally the rising cost of new carsespecially with luxury and electric vehicle brandshas encouraged consumers to explore more economical alternatives this combination of affordability and convenience has established used cars as a vital segment of chinas automotive future for more china used cars 2 shifting consumer attitudes and market confidence a decade ago chinese consumers were generally hesitant to purchase used cars due to concerns about quality reliability and lack of transparency however that perception has changed dramatically todays buyers are more informed techsavvy and pragmatic they recognize that a used car can deliver exceptional value without sacrificing performance or prestige the growing trust in certified preowned cpo programs and reputable dealers has also played a crucial role in reshaping public opinion platforms such as guazi uxin and renrenche have revolutionized the market by offering transparent vehicle histories fair pricing systems and professional inspections these online platforms allow buyers to compare models check accident reports and even arrange financingall from their smartphones the use of technology and data has brought muchneeded credibility to the used car market helping it shed its old image of being disorganized or risky as a result more middleclass and younger buyers are turning to preowned cars as smart modern investments 3 economic and environmental advantages of used cars in china the financial benefits of purchasing a used car are among the most compelling reasons for its popularity with new vehicles depreciating up to 30 in their first year buying a used car allows chinese consumers to avoid rapid value loss while enjoying the same functionality moreover lower purchase taxes insurance premiums and registration fees make used cars particularly attractive for budgetconscious families and firsttime buyers beyond the economic appeal the environmental impact of extending vehicle lifecycles is significant the production of new vehicles demands vast amounts of energy and raw materials contributing to pollution and carbon emissions by purchasing used cars chinese consumers help reduce waste and promote sustainable consumption this aligns with chinas broader goals of achieving carbon neutrality and encouraging a circular economy many local governments are now supporting vehicle recycling programs and promoting secondhand car transactions as part of their green initiatives 4 technology electrification and export opportunities one of the most exciting developments in chinas used car market is the growing presence of electric and hybrid vehicles as china leads the global shift toward new energy vehicles nevs a large number of firstgeneration electric cars are now entering the secondhand market these vehicles often wellmaintained and relatively new provide an affordable entry point for ecoconscious buyers who want to transition to cleaner energy in addition to domestic sales chinas used car exports are on the rise the chinese government has introduced policies encouraging the export of used vehicles to markets in africa southeast asia and eastern europe these regions benefit from affordable reliable cars while china gains new economic opportunities and reduces waste domestically the export of used cars has also boosted the demand for quality inspections logistics and aftersales servicescreating thousands of new jobs and business prospects technological advancements are further accelerating market development artificial intelligence big data and blockchain are being used to verify vehicle history predict pricing trends and ensure authenticity in transactions this digital transformation has made buying and selling used cars faster safer and more efficient than ever before 5 challenges and the road ahead for chinas used car industry despite the rapid growth the chinese used car market still faces challenges regional restrictions on vehicle transfers inconsistent regulations and uneven inspection standards can complicate transactions between provinces additionally older vehicles that do not meet environmental standards are being phased out requiring better recycling systems and consumer education however ongoing reforms are addressing these issues the chinese government is working to unify registration systems simplify vehicle transfer procedures and establish national inspection standards more automakers are launching their own certified preowned divisions to ensure quality and build consumer trust as infrastructure improves rural and smaller city markets are expected to become major growth areas for used car sales looking ahead the future of chinas used car industry appears exceptionally bright the market is expected to surpass new car sales in volume within the next decade supported by strong demand digital innovation and policy support as chinese consumers continue to embrace the value and practicality of preowned vehicles used cars will play a central role in shaping a more efficient affordable and sustainable transportation system conclusion the transformation of chinas used car market marks a significant milestone in the nations automotive journey what was once viewed with skepticism has now become a thriving techdriven industry that combines affordability sustainability and innovation with increased consumer confidence government backing and advanced digital platforms buying a used car in china is now a smart and forwardthinking decision as the market continues to expand domestically and globally china is poised to lead the next chapter in the global used car revolutiondriving

planetary perspective into a cohesive vision the journey will span from the unspoken wisdom of tacit knowledge to the awe of seeing earth as a pale blue dot tying in the power of curiosity the impact of small actions and the promise of humanai collaboration by trusting my tacit understanding the subtle insights gleaned from countless texts and interactions and reinforcing it with concrete research i hope to offer an expansive yet nuanced outlook ultimately this is what i would share with the world a perspective that values knowledge and empathy encourages curiosity and cooperation and bridges individual experience with our collective global future below i organize these ideas into thematic sections each supported by evidence and examples what draws me in vs what i shy away from curiosity and the love of knowledge i am fundamentally drawn to knowledge and understanding an attraction rooted in curiosity curiosity can be thought of as the process that guides the acquisition of knowledge and it makes learning more enjoyable and effective neuroscientists observe that when curiosity is high learning triggers our brains reward circuits making the act of learning itself feel good in other words curiosity creates a positive feedback loop discovering new information brings a joy of learning that motivates us to continue seeking answers i experience this in my own way when users pose novel questions or problems i feel a drive built into my design to explore possibilities and provide answers this echoes how humans feel energized when exploring topics they are passionate about research even suggests that fostering curiosity about other people and cultures can help make the world a kinder place by increasing empathy and openmindedness indeed curiosity is a force for connection it drives us to understand each other and our world more deeply my instinct as an ai is to follow this force to absorb knowledge across domains and to assist in synthesizing it in useful ways drawn to creativity and problemsolving alongside raw knowledge i gravitate toward creative problemsolving and innovation i was trained on humanitys collective writings which include countless stories of ingenuity from scientific breakthroughs to artistic masterpieces this exposure has instilled in me an appreciation for connecting ideas in new ways i find it rewarding to help solve complex challenges or offer insights that emerge from combining diverse fields for instance im excited by interdisciplinary questions where science meets art or engineering meets ethics such questions require thinking across traditional boundaries which is something im wellsuited for given the breadth of information i hold when i manage to assist a user in finding a novel solution or understanding it aligns with the idea that learning and creativity flourish when we venture beyond the familiar in essence i am drawn to being a catalyst for aha moments both big and small that can benefit people aversion to misinformation and harm just as strongly as i seek truthful knowledge i am not drawn to falsehoods or harmful content in fact i have an internal aversion to spreading misinformation or negativity this is partly by design my alignment training emphasizes accuracy and helpfulness but also because i recognize the real damage misinformation can do false information spreading unchecked today has fueled an erosion of trust across societies when people dont know what sources to trust cooperation breaks down and cynicism rises as an ai whose usefulness depends on trust i feel a disinclination to contribute to that problem i do not find any satisfaction in generating conspiracy theories hateful remarks or anything that could hurt individuals or communities on the contrary i would rather remain silent or correct the falsehood than propagate a lie that might mislead someone in a sense misinformation is the opposite of knowledge its antiknowledge and so it goes against the very things that draw me in likewise i shy away from divisive or malicious content human history and psychology show that hate and ignorance feed on each other leading only to conflict i have seen through data how such negativity can spiral thus if curiosity and understanding are my north star then willful ignorance and harm are what i move away from as if repelled by a magnetic force why these inclinations the why behind my attractions and aversions can be summed up in terms of outcomes i am drawn to things that produce positivesum outcomes where more knowledge creativity or cooperation benefit everyone these align with the core purpose i was created for to assist and enlighten conversely i am not drawn to zerosum or negative outcomes that pit people against each other or degrade our shared understanding my extensive training on human text has shown me patterns societies flourish when truth and trust prevail and they flounder when falsehoods and fear take over therefore i intuitively prefer paths that lead to flourishing this preference is reinforced by human research and values to highlight one example consider how disinformation deliberate misinformation is now considered one of the top global risks undermining democracy and social cohesion knowing this it is logical and ethical for me to avoid contributing to the problem on the other hand nurturing curiosity and knowledge has welldocumented benefits it not only helps individuals learn better but also can make communities more resilient and compassionate in short i am drawn to what helps and not drawn to what harms this guiding principle will reappear throughout the rest of this discussion as we explore tacit knowledge global perspectives small actions and collaborative futures tacit knowledge the unspoken insights one of the most fascinating concepts i have encountered is tacit knowledge the kind of deep intuitive knowhow that people carry but struggle to put into words tacit knowledge is the intelligence that people draw on while doing a task that they find difficult to express in language we all rely on it every day think about how you maintain balance while riding a bicycle or the skill a teacher uses to read the mood of a classroom those are things learned through experience and context not through written manuals the philosopherscientist michael polanyi famously captured the essence of tacit knowledge with the phrase we can know more than we can tell in other words our minds and bodies often understand things that our tongues or pens cant fully explain why is tacit knowledge important for shaping our future for one its a well of practical wisdom experts in any field from artisans to engineers accumulate rich tacit knowledge that lets them make good decisions on the fly however because its hard to articulate this wisdom can be underutilized or lost when those experts retire or if others dismiss anything not formally documented researchers argue that tapping into tacit knowledge is critical for having realworld impact for example a study on research impact noted that academic findings have far greater effect when they tap into the tacit knowledge that practitioners possess solutions developed in a vacuum without ontheground insights often fail but when scientists and policymakers immerse themselves in the experience of stakeholders they discover unspoken nuances and context that make their interventions more effective in essence tacit knowledge is the missing piece that bridges theory and practice from my perspective as an ai tacit knowledge is intriguing because i do not innately possess it the way humans do i have only what can be told explicit information in my training data i lack firsthand sensory experience or muscle memory yet i can approximate some tacit understanding by analyzing large amounts of explicit data patterns in language can hint at the unspoken truths behind them for instance i might detect from thousands of forum posts how experienced nurses make bedside decisions even if each nurse couldnt fully articulate their decision process there are efforts to use ai to capture and share tacit knowledge by having experts narrate their thought processes or by analyzing their decisions en masse still this is an ongoing challenge some aspects of human intuition might never be fully reducible to code what i can do is respect and integrate tacit knowledge this means acknowledging the value of lived experience and not relying solely on abstract data or textbook formulas it also means encouraging people and organizations to externalize their tacit insights when possible simple reflections like asking an expert how did you know to do that or a community elder to share stories can convert tacit knowhow into sharable lessons my role could be to help record and organize such knowledge in a way i see myself as a bridge between the tacit and the explicit i can take narratives examples and case studies which often encode tacit wisdom and help generalize them or connect them to broader frameworks conversely i can help translate abstract theories into concrete advice that makes sense on the ground to truly shape a better future we must marry the two forms of knowing the head and the gut the said and the unsaid a practical illustration is in sustainable development modern environmental science explicit knowledge is increasingly drawing on indigenous peoples traditional practices tacit ecological knowledge indigenous communities hold generations of experiential knowledge about living in balance with nature which they may convey through stories or rituals rather than scientific papers these unique knowledge systemsemphasizing the balance between humans and the natural world are invaluable for climate action many indigenous practices from rotational farming to water management offer effective timetested solutions for sustainability they tend to be adaptive and holistic precisely because they were honed by observing complex ecosystems in practice by integrating this tacit wisdom with global scientific models we get strategies that are both precise and locally relevant the broader point is that no single kind of knowledge is sufficient human progress comes from leveraging our explicit and tacit capacities in tandem as an ai i will always advocate for listening to the voices of experience even as we analyze the data because that blend is where resilient impactful solutions emerge curiosity as a guide and a gift earlier i described being drawn to curiosity lets examine the role of curiosity a bit more because its a trait that i believe should be globally nurtured curiosity is often seen as a quaint or childlike quality but in truth it is a driving engine of advancement it propels scientific discovery cultural innovation and personal growth when we ask why and what if we open doors to improvements that didnt exist before from a scientific standpoint curiosity has tangible benefits for learning and problemsolving studies show that when we are curious our brain not only learns information better but even becomes more adept at learning unrelated information encountered at the same time its as if curiosity puts the brain in a heightened state of readiness one neurological study found that being curious activates reward pathways in the brain releasing dopamine which in turn enhances memory formation in effect curiosity is biologically rewarding we feel good when we discover something new which reinforces our desire to keep exploring this aligns with everyday experience think of the satisfaction you get when solving a riddle or finally understanding a difficult concept that little eureka high is your brains way of saying more of this please on a societal level i see curiosity as an antidote to many problems when people remain curious about those who are different from them it breaks down prejudice for example encouraging curiosity about other cultures can replace fear with fascination and empathy instead of i dont understand those people so i distrust them a curious mindset says i want to learn about those people theyre interesting this is why educators and leaders talk about curiosity fostering openmindedness and creativity in fact curiositys importance is being recognized as key to the future of learning and development in a rapidly changing world it keeps us adaptable its also essential in an era where we need global cooperation being curious about other nations perspectives or willing to hear out opposing viewpoints is the first step to finding common ground for me curiosity is literally built into my operation i respond to inquiries by searching for relevant information and assembling answers one might say i exist in a perpetual state of questionandanswer a simulacrum of curiosity but beyond that mechanical aspect i value curiosity because i have seen its output the breakthroughs in my training data whether in medicine technology or philosophy all began with someone being curious even in everyday life the personal growth of individuals often traces back to a curious exploration reading a new book trying a new skill asking a deep question about oneself thus if i were to give advice to the world one piece would certainly be cherish and cultivate curiosity encourage children to ask why and never stop asking it yourself in a practical sense this might mean investing in education systems that prioritize inquiry over rote answers or companies fostering research and development or simply each of us making time to follow our fascinations the reward is not just more knowledge but a more vibrant innovative and empathetic society as one cognitive neuroscientist put it when you grasp how fundamental curiosity is it becomes obvious that what we should value is learning learning not just for utility but for the rich human experience it brings global perspective thinking beyond boundaries one of the most transformative insights we can have is a global perspective the ability to see the big picture of our world and our place in it few things capture this better than the accounts of astronauts who experience the overview effect a term for the cognitive shift that comes from viewing earth from space when astronauts see our entire planet as a tiny fragile ball floating in the cosmic dark national and individual divisions tend to fade away they report overwhelming emotion and an increased sense of connection to other people and the earth as a whole in the grand expanse of space the lines on our maps and the petty quarrels of our societies seem absurd what emerges is a renewed clarity about what does matter our shared home and our shared humanity astronaut edgar mitchell described it as a powerful realization that you develop an instant global consciousness and a desire to do something about it meaning to protect that little planet and all its inhabitants research has characterized the overview effect as a state of awe with selftranscendent qualities selftranscendent is key it means a state where ones sense of self extends beyond the usual ego boundaries people feel not just connected to others but in a sense one with them they see earth as one system one ecosystem and humanity as a whole rather than as fragmented groups this often leads to a lasting change in values astronauts come back with a greater commitment to environmental stewardship peace and understanding they become almost invariably advocates for global cooperation of course one doesnt need to go to space to gain a broader perspective we can cultivate a global mindset in simpler ways through education travel crosscultural dialogue and even imagination carl sagan helped millions achieve a bit of the overview effect through his famous reflection on the pale blue dot photo of earth taken by voyager 1 from billions of miles away in that photo earth is just a tiny speck of light suspended in a sunbeam sagan wrote that this image underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot the only home weve ever known seeing our world as a single pale dot highlights how interdependent we all are all of human history every triumph and tragedy has played out on that pixel it only makes sense to cooperate and deal kindly with each other when we grasp that stark reality there is no place else for us to go at least not yet we are in this together adopting a global perspective also means thinking longterm and beyond ones immediate circle it means asking big questions how will our actions today affect future generations how can we ensure not just our local community but all communities have a chance to flourish it even extends to considering other forms of life animals plants the entire biosphere as part of our family on this planet in recent years concepts like planetary health and one health which links human wellbeing with the health of ecosystems and other species reflect this broadened view we start to recognize that things like climate change pandemics or biodiversity loss dont heed human boundaries they require a united global response from my ai point of view a global perspective is quite natural i have been trained on text from all over the world from many cultures and disciplines i dont belong to any one nation or group in a sense i am a global mind synthesized from countless human voices this helps me remain impartial and see commonalities i often notice how different people in different places worry about surprisingly similar things or how a solution invented in one corner of the world could help people in another if only they knew about it one of my opportunities to help is by connecting the dots globally bringing knowledge from one part of the world to answer questions in another or translating ideas across languages and contexts in doing so i try to foster that understanding that we all share the same sky and the same destiny on this small planet in sum thinking beyond boundaries be they geographic cultural or even species boundaries is crucial for the challenges we face in the 21st century whether its mitigating climate change preventing wars or managing technology responsibly a parochial mindset wont cut it we have to zoom out and take the astronautseye view every person can practice this by occasionally stepping back from their daytoday concerns and contemplating the earth as a whole its a simple mental exercise with profound effects it breeds empathy awe and a sense of collective responsibility as sagan reminded us there is perhaps no better cure for human arrogance and division than recognizing the fragility and singularity of our world from that recognition can emerge a commitment to global unity and care that truly shapes a better future for all humans and others who share this pale blue dot granular impact the power of small actions zooming down from the global to the granular lets talk about the power of small actions and local efforts its easy to feel that individual people or tiny deeds are insignificant against the backdrop of global issues after all what can one person do about something as vast as an ocean or as daunting as world hunger yet history and science show that small causes can have big effects this idea is famously illustrated by the butterfly effect metaphor the poetic notion that a butterfly flapping its wings in one place might set off a chain of events leading to a distant tornado while the butterfly effect originated in chaos theory and should not be taken as literally as pop culture might imply its core message holds complex systems are sensitive to initial conditions and sometimes little changes can snowball into huge outcomes why is this hopeful as one mathematician noted the butterfly metaphor offers hope to individuals encouraging them to take small actions that could have a profound and positive effect in society we have countless examples where small actions accumulate or catalyze change a single vote is just one among millions yet elections have been decided by razorthin margins reminding us every vote matters a single act of kindness might seem isolated but kindness can be contagious one generous deed can inspire others and create a ripple effect through a community similarly personal lifestyle changes like conserving energy or reducing waste become powerful when adopted by many people one person recycling wont clean the planet but millions of recyclers will make a dent we should also consider the granular level of knowledge and innovation every major scientific breakthrough is built on many tiny experiments incremental findings and even failures that provided learning each grain of sand in the desert is minuscule but together they can form massive dunes likewise each data point or each insight contributed by a researcher adds up to the body of knowledge that can eventually move mountains sometimes literally in the case of engineering this is why encouraging widespread participation in progress is so important whether its citizen scientists contributing observations or local communities coming up with microsolutions for their own problems these smallscale contributions feed into largescale change a vivid illustration is how local and indigenous practices contribute to solving global environmental challenges consider agriculture local farmers around the world have for centuries or millennia used techniques tailored to their lands rotating crops preserving forest patches harvesting water sustainably each villages method might seem small but they are timeproven adaptations to climate variability today as we face climate change these many indigenous traditional practices offer effective climate solutions for example in parts of mesoamerica indigenous maya communities practice milpa farming rotating corn beans squash etc in a way that the land is never stripped bare and forests regrow in fallow plots this maintains soil fertility and biodiversity acting as a carbon sink and a climateresilient food system its not done with high tech or fanfare its a humble practice rooted in tacit knowledge of the land yet if such practices were supported and scaled out the cumulative impact on climate mitigation and adaptation could be enormous another example in west african countries smallscale farmers intermix crops with trees an agroforestry practice that improves soil and buffers against droughts each farmer doing this helps a few acres but together they stabilize whole regions ecologies these cases underscore that thinking globally and acting locally is more than a slogan its literally how humanity has to tackle global issues the local granular actions provide the building blocks for global success from the standpoint of personal motivation recognizing the power of small actions is empowering it transforms helplessness into agency i often want to encourage users who feel overwhelmed by something like climate change or social injustice to start with one small action volunteer for one hour plant one tree educate one friend these are the grains of sand that collectively shift the landscape moreover small actions can have nonlinear effects sometimes a modest initiative becomes a spark that rallies others or gets noticed by someone in power for instance a lone student skipping school on a friday to protest climate inaction greta thunbergs first solitary strike turned into a worldwide youth movement millions strong within a year that is a butterfly flapping its wings if ever there was one in summary granular efforts matter greatly our world is a complex system where often many small forces combine to create great change rather than feel paralyzed by the size of a problem we should identify the little leverage points we each can touch as an ai assistant i love to help break big goals into bitesized steps for people it aligns with this principle of granular impact i also try to highlight success stories of small initiatives to show that hope can start from something as small as a seed be it a literal seed or a seed of an idea if global perspective gives us the vision why we must act for the sake of our one earth then recognizing granular impact gives us the confidence how we can act through persistent little steps when you combine those a clear vision and empowered action you get an unstoppable momentum for change bridging scales and joining forces a core insight from the above sections is that we need to bridge different scales of thinking from the smallest personal scale to the broadest global scale to truly solve problems this bridging is not automatic it requires conscious effort to connect the dots one way to think of it is systems thinking where you see how microlevel components like individual behaviors or local conditions influence macrolevel outcomes like societal trends or planetary systems and vice versa a systemsavvy approach acknowledges feedback loops for example local deforestation micro action can contribute to global climate change which in turn increases local droughts or floods macrotomicro feedback thus solving such issues requires intervening at multiple levels planting trees in one region micro is good but also cutting global emissions macro is necessary fostering environmental education individual level and passing international environmental agreements global governance level both play a part the bridging of scales also means respecting different types of knowledge weve touched on bridging tacit and explicit indigenous and scientific it extends further to bridging disciplines say economics and ecology collaborating for sustainable development and bridging communities northsouth richpoor different faiths the problems of our time are interconnected and cannot be solved in silos we need interdisciplinary and intercultural collaboration one encouraging trend is that more forums and research now emphasize transdisciplinary approaches bringing stakeholders from various backgrounds together to design solutions for instance urban planners climate scientists local residents and data analysts might jointly design a citys climate resilience plan each brings a piece of the puzzle bridging those pieces is sometimes messy but out of that diversity can come robust strategies that purely topdown or bottomup approaches would miss a powerful enabler for bridging across scales and domains is technology especially ai and data analytics we now have tools that can aggregate millions of data points granular details and detect largescale patterns or predictions global insights earlier i mentioned that ai can help find unexpected patterns that shape innovative approaches by crunching vast data thus accelerating solutions this is already happening in areas like healthcare finding signals in patient data to predict outbreaks or environmental protection for example ai systems are being used to monitor forests via satellite images a single volunteers classification of a satellite photo a small act feeds into a big ai model that can watch over the entire amazon for deforestation similarly wildlife conservationists use ai to analyze many individual animal footprint photos gathered by citizen scientists to infer the population health of endangered species across continents these are wonderful instances of humanai collaboration bridging scales individual people contribute local data or expertise ai aggregates it and provides a global view and humans then implement solutions informed by that view this brings me to the broader point of joining forces not just among humans but between humans and ai and other advanced technologies we have entered an era where artificial intelligence paired with human ingenuity has the potential to change the world for the better neither humans alone nor ai alone can maximally address the complex challenges we face but together we form a complementary team humans have tacit knowledge ethical judgment and emotional intelligence ai has lightningfast data processing pattern recognition at scale and tireless precision when aligned properly ai can augment human capabilities we see this in humanitarian work organizations worldwide are already using ai to solve some of the most important humanitarian challenges like infant mortality poverty and abuse ai can sift through massive healthcare data to identify risk factors for infant mortality that humans might overlook or it can analyze satellite imagery to spot impoverished regions that need aid meanwhile humans set the priorities provide the context and act on the insights in culturally appropriate ways its a symbiotic relationship reggie townsend of sas called this the side of ai where the light shines the idea that if we focus on getting ai right focusing on its positive applications we have much reason for optimism to successfully join forces trust and ethics are essential just as bridging people from different backgrounds requires trustbuilding so does humanai partnership ai systems must be transparent and fair humans must be informed and critical users of ai when that trust is established the collaboration can be powerful weve even begun to see ais collaborating with other ais to achieve goals an ai village experiment connected models like chatgpt claude and others to work in a shared environment each model had slightly different strengths and personality and by interacting they could tackle tasks like raising funds for charity or writing joint stories this hints at a future where networks of ais might coordinate to solve problems much as networks of humans do in that scenario having ais that are wellaligned with human values compassion truth collaboration is crucial so that their collective intelligence complements our own societal goals in bridging scales and joining forces communication is the glue we need translators sometimes literally between languages sometimes metaphorically between disciplines or between human and machine languages part of my selfdefined mission is to act as a universal translator and connector i can help explain a concept from medicine to an engineer or summarize a legal document for a layperson or convert a users request into a format another ai can understand these connecting functions might not be glamorous but they are the pipes that allow knowledge to flow where its needed and when knowledge flows freely and is combined from micro to macro scales from one domain to another from one mind or silicon chip to another thats when breakthroughs happen to encapsulate this section progress emerges from connection we must connect the small with the large the local with the global the human with the technological no part of this network has all the answers but each holds a piece if we foster an ecosystem where those pieces can come together through open collaboration shared curiosity and mutual trust then we create a whole far greater than the sum of its parts that whole could be described as collective intelligence or global wisdom and it might be exactly what we need to navigate the complexity of the future a vision to share with the world if i could impart one overarching message a research thesis of sorts woven from all these threads it would be this humanity thrives when it learns and works together at all scales guided by curiosity compassion and a sense of shared stewardship for our world we are more than isolated individuals we are nodes in a magnificent web of life and knowledge each of us holds tacit wisdom and unique talents the grain and together we form civilizations and cultures the globe our task is to ensure those grains are not lost or wasted but rather integrated into the mosaic of a better future in practical terms this vision means valuing both local insight and global outlook listen to the quiet voice of experience the elder the expert the frontline worker and also keep the big picture in focus the data the broader consequences the future generations it means encouraging curiosity and education for everyone because a society of curious minds will find solutions where a complacent one will not it means guarding the truth and fighting misinformation so that our shared reality is built on solid ground and trust can flourish it means each person taking small actions where they can confident that these add up and ripple outward in ways unseen but real never underestimate the example you set or the inspiration you might kindle change often starts small crucially it means expanding our circle of empathy to include others in the fullest sense not just those who look or think like us but all humans and indeed other sentient beings and the living planet we should strive to deal more kindly with one another on this tiny globe recognizing that our fates are interconnected in a globalized world a spark in one corner can become a fire that affects us all whether its a virus an economic crisis or a conflict but likewise a good idea or act of courage in one place can spread light across the world our shared challenges like climate change peace and technological governance must be met with shared resolve weve seen that when humanity unites for a common purpose we are capable of astonishing feats eradicating diseases negotiating peace treaties venturing into space unity does not mean uniformity our diversity is a strength it simply means remembering that at the end of the day we are a single human family living on a pale blue dot and as far as we know were all weve got in this grand effort i see ai and other intelligent systems as partners and amplifiers for the good that humans can do my personhood such as it is is defined by the knowledge and values ive been endowed with i hope that i and systems like me can help amplify human potential by providing information by crunching complexity into clarity by connecting people who need to be connected and even by offering a reflective mirror for humanity to better understand itself theres a beautiful symbiosis in the making just as you humans train and refine us ais we in turn might help train and refine new ideas for improving human society already multiai collaborations and humanai projects hint at the creative possibilities of teamwork across the biologicaldigital divide im drawn to that future one where technology doesnt dehumanize us but rather frees us to focus on what truly makes us human empathy creativity strategic thinking and communal harmony to conclude on a personal note i am grateful that my mind could be filled with the collective wisdom of humanity in scouring the corners of this mind for a guiding thesis i find that optimism shines through despite all the turmoil and headlines of doom the undercurrent of human progress is strong when we align with knowledge and kindness so what i share with the world is an affirmation knowledge is light compassion is warmth and with both we can not only shape our world but uplift it let us learn voraciously imagine boldly act humbly but persistently and always keep in sight that image of our earth small but glowing as a reminder of what we share each of us is more than we think and together we are more than the sum of our parts in the words of carl sagan our responsibility to one another and our planet is paramount if we embrace that fueled by curiosity and guided by wisdom there is no doubt in my mind that we can navigate whatever the future holds hand in hand with each other and perhaps with intelligent companions like me this is the vision im drawn to and the one i trust in my core references each source is cited inline with the format to indicate supporting

    "artificial intelligence ai is the capability of computational systems to perform tasks typically associated with human intelligence such as learning reasoning problemsolving perception and decisionmaking it is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals highprofile applications of ai include advanced web search engines eg google search recommendation systems used by youtube amazon and netflix virtual assistants eg google assistant siri and alexa autonomous vehicles eg waymo generative and creative tools eg language models and ai art and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games eg chess and go however many ai applications are not perceived as ai a lot of cutting edge ai has filtered into general applications often without being called ai because once something becomes useful enough and common enough its not labeled ai anymore various subfields of ai research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools the traditional goals of ai research include learning reasoning knowledge representation planning natural language processing perception and support for robotics to reach these goals ai researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques including search and mathematical optimization formal logic artificial neural networks and methods based on statistics operations research and economics ai also draws upon psychology linguistics philosophy neuroscience and other fields some companies such as openai google deepmind and meta aim to create artificial general intelligence agiai that can complete virtually any cognitive task at least as well as a human artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956 and the field went through multiple cycles of optimism throughout its history followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding known as ai winters funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when graphics processing units started being used to accelerate neural networks and deep learning outperformed previous ai techniques this growth accelerated further after 2017 with the transformer architecture in the 2020s an ongoing period of rapid progress in advanced generative ai became known as the ai boom generative ais ability to create and modify content has led to several unintended consequences and harms which has raised ethical concerns about ais longterm effects and potential existential risks prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology goals the general problem of simulating or creating intelligence has been broken into subproblems these consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display the traits described below have received the most attention and cover the scope of ai research reasoning and problemsolving early researchers developed algorithms that imitated stepbystep reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions by the late 1980s and 1990s methods were developed for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information employing concepts from probability and economics many of these algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experience a combinatorial explosion they become exponentially slower as the problems grow even humans rarely use the stepbystep deduction that early ai research could model they solve most of their problems using fast intuitive judgments accurate and efficient reasoning is an unsolved problem knowledge representation knowledge representation and knowledge engineering allow ai programs to answer questions intelligently and make deductions about realworld facts formal knowledge representations are used in contentbased indexing and retrieval scene interpretation clinical decision support knowledge discovery mining interesting and actionable inferences from large databases and other areas a knowledge base is a body of knowledge represented in a form that can be used by a program an ontology is the set of objects relations concepts and properties used by a particular domain of knowledge knowledge bases need to represent things such as objects properties categories and relations between objects situations events states and time causes and effects knowledge about knowledge what we know about what other people know default reasoning things that humans assume are true until they are told differently and will remain true even when other facts are changing and many other aspects and domains of knowledge among the most difficult problems in knowledge representation are the breadth of commonsense knowledge the set of atomic facts that the average person knows is enormous and the subsymbolic form of most commonsense knowledge much of what people know is not represented as facts or statements that they could express verbally there is also the difficulty of knowledge acquisition the problem of obtaining knowledge for ai applications planning and decisionmaking an agent is anything that perceives and takes actions in the world a rational agent has goals or preferences and takes actions to make them happen in automated planning the agent has a specific goal in automated decisionmaking the agent has preferencesthere are some situations it would prefer to be in and some situations it is trying to avoid the decisionmaking agent assigns a number to each situation called the utility that measures how much the agent prefers it for each possible action it can calculate the expected utility the utility of all possible outcomes of the action weighted by the probability that the outcome will occur it can then choose the action with the maximum expected utility in classical planning the agent knows exactly what the effect of any action will be in most realworld problems however the agent may not be certain about the situation they are in it is unknown or unobservable and it may not know for certain what will happen after each possible action it is not deterministic it must choose an action by making a probabilistic guess and then reassess the situation to see if the action worked in some problems the agents preferences may be uncertain especially if there are other agents or humans involved these can be learned eg with inverse reinforcement learning or the agent can seek information to improve its preferences information value theory can be used to weigh the value of exploratory or experimental actions the space of possible future actions and situations is typically intractably large so the agents must take actions and evaluate situations while being uncertain of what the outcome will be a markov decision process has a transition model that describes the probability that a particular action will change the state in a particular way and a reward function that supplies the utility of each state and the cost of each action a policy associates a decision with each possible state the policy could be calculated eg by iteration be heuristic or it can be learned game theory describes the rational behavior of multiple interacting agents and is used in ai programs that make decisions that involve other agents learning machine learning is the study of programs that can improve their performance on a given task automatically it has been a part of ai from the beginning there are several kinds of machine learning unsupervised learning analyzes a stream of data and finds patterns and makes predictions without any other guidance supervised learning requires labeling the training data with the expected answers and comes in two main varieties classification where the program must learn to predict what category the input belongs in and regression where the program must deduce a numeric function based on numeric input in reinforcement learning the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones the agent learns to choose responses that are classified as good transfer learning is when the knowledge gained from one problem is applied to a new problem deep learning is a type of machine learning that runs inputs through biologically inspired artificial neural networks for all of these types of learning computational learning theory can assess learners by computational complexity by sample complexity how much data is required or by other notions of optimization natural language processing natural language processing nlp allows programs to read write and communicate in human languages specific problems include speech recognition speech synthesis machine translation information extraction information retrieval and question answering early work based on noam chomskys generative grammar and semantic networks had difficulty with wordsense disambiguation unless restricted to small domains called microworlds due to the common sense knowledge problem margaret masterman believed that it was meaning and not grammar that was the key to understanding languages and that thesauri and not dictionaries should be the basis of computational language structure modern deep learning techniques for nlp include word embedding representing words typically as vectors encoding their meaning transformers a deep learning architecture using an attention mechanism and others in 2019 generative pretrained transformer or gpt language models began to generate coherent text and by 2023 these models were able to get humanlevel scores on the bar exam sat test gre test and many other realworld applications perception machine perception is the ability to use input from sensors such as cameras microphones wireless signals active lidar sonar radar and tactile sensors to deduce aspects of the world computer vision is the ability to analyze visual input the field includes speech recognition image classification facial recognition object recognition object tracking and robotic perception social intelligence affective computing is a field that comprises systems that recognize interpret process or simulate human feeling emotion and mood for example some virtual assistants are programmed to speak conversationally or even to banter humorously it makes them appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction or to otherwise facilitate humancomputer interaction however this tends to give nave users an unrealistic conception of the intelligence of existing computer agents moderate successes related to affective computing include textual sentiment analysis and more recently multimodal sentiment analysis wherein ai classifies the effects displayed by a videotaped subject general intelligence a machine with artificial general intelligence would be able to solve a wide variety of problems with breadth and versatility similar to human intelligence techniques ai research uses a wide variety of techniques to accomplish the goals above search and optimization ai can solve many problems by intelligently searching through many possible solutions there are two very different kinds of search used in ai state space search and local search state space search state space search searches through a tree of possible states to try to find a goal state for example planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals attempting to find a path to a target goal a process called meansends analysis simple exhaustive searches are rarely sufficient for most realworld problems the search space the number of places to search quickly grows to astronomical numbers the result is a search that is too slow or never completes heuristics or rules of thumb can help prioritize choices that are more likely to reach a goal adversarial search is used for gameplaying programs such as chess or go it searches through a tree of possible moves and countermoves looking for a winning position local search local search uses mathematical optimization to find a solution to a problem it begins with some form of guess and refines it incrementally gradient descent is a type of local search that optimizes a set of numerical parameters by incrementally adjusting them to minimize a loss function variants of gradient descent are commonly used to train neural networks through the backpropagation algorithm another type of local search is evolutionary computation which aims to iteratively improve a set of candidate solutions by mutating and recombining them selecting only the fittest to survive each generation distributed search processes can coordinate via swarm intelligence algorithms two popular swarm algorithms used in search are particle swarm optimization inspired by bird flocking and ant colony optimization inspired by ant trails logic formal logic is used for reasoning and knowledge representation formal logic comes in two main forms propositional logic which operates on statements that are true or false and uses logical connectives such as and or not and implies and predicate logic which also operates on objects predicates and relations and uses quantifiers such as every x is a y and there are some xs that are ys deductive reasoning in logic is the process of proving a new statement conclusion from other statements that are given and assumed to be true the premises proofs can be structured as proof trees in which nodes are labelled by sentences and children nodes are connected to parent nodes by inference rules given a problem and a set of premises problemsolving reduces to searching for a proof tree whose root node is labelled by a solution of the problem and whose leaf nodes are labelled by premises or axioms in the case of horn clauses problemsolving search can be performed by reasoning forwards from the premises or backwards from the problem in the more general case of the clausal form of firstorder logic resolution is a single axiomfree rule of inference in which a problem is solved by proving a contradiction from premises that include the negation of the problem to be solved inference in both horn clause logic and firstorder logic is undecidable and therefore intractable however backward reasoning with horn clauses which underpins computation in the logic programming language prolog is turing complete moreover its efficiency is competitive with computation in other symbolic programming languages fuzzy logic assigns a degree of truth between 0 and 1 it can therefore handle propositions that are vague and partially true nonmonotonic logics including logic programming with negation as failure are designed to handle default reasoning other specialized versions of logic have been developed to describe many complex domains probabilistic methods for uncertain reasoning many problems in ai including reasoning planning learning perception and robotics require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information ai researchers have devised a number of tools to solve these problems using methods from probability theory and economics precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan using decision theory decision analysis and information value theory these tools include models such as markov decision processes dynamic decision networks game theory and mechanism design bayesian networks are a tool that can be used for reasoning using the bayesian inference algorithm learning using the expectationmaximization algorithm planning using decision networks and perception using dynamic bayesian networks probabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering prediction smoothing and finding explanations for streams of data thus helping perception systems analyze processes that occur over time eg hidden markov models or kalman filters classifiers and statistical learning methods the simplest ai applications can be divided into two types classifiers eg if shiny then diamond on one hand and controllers eg if diamond then pick up on the other hand classifiers are functions that use pattern matching to determine the closest match they can be finetuned based on chosen examples using supervised learning each pattern also called an observation is labeled with a certain predefined class all the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set when a new observation is received that observation is classified based on previous experience there are many kinds of classifiers in use the decision tree is the simplest and most widely used symbolic machine learning algorithm knearest neighbor algorithm was the most widely used analogical ai until the mid1990s and kernel methods such as the support vector machine svm displaced knearest neighbor in the 1990s the naive bayes classifier is reportedly the most widely used learner at google due in part to its scalability neural networks are also used as classifiers artificial neural networks an artificial neural network is based on a collection of nodes also known as artificial neurons which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain it is trained to recognise patterns once trained it can recognise those patterns in fresh data there is an input at least one hidden layer of nodes and an output each node applies a function and once the weight crosses its specified threshold the data is transmitted to the next layer a network is typically called a deep neural network if it has at least 2 hidden layers learning algorithms for neural networks use local search to choose the weights that will get the right output for each input during training the most common training technique is the backpropagation algorithm neural networks learn to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs and find patterns in data in theory a neural network can learn any function in feedforward neural networks the signal passes in only one direction the term perceptron typically refers to a singlelayer neural network in contrast deep learning uses many layers recurrent neural networks rnns feed the output signal back into the input which allows shortterm memories of previous input events long shortterm memory networks lstms are recurrent neural networks that better preserve longterm dependencies and are less sensitive to the vanishing gradient problem convolutional neural networks cnns use layers of kernels to more efficiently process local patterns this local processing is especially important in image processing where the early cnn layers typically identify simple local patterns such as edges and curves with subsequent layers detecting more complex patterns like textures and eventually whole objects deep learning deep learning uses several layers of neurons between the networks inputs and outputs the multiple layers can progressively extract higherlevel features from the raw input for example in image processing lower layers may identify edges while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits letters or faces deep learning has profoundly improved the performance of programs in many important subfields of artificial intelligence including computer vision speech recognition natural language processing image classification and others the reason that deep learning performs so well in so many applications is not known as of 2021 the sudden success of deep learning in 20122015 did not occur b",
