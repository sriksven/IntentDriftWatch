    "under the leadership of bari weiss the free press climate change coverage mirrors that of rightwing media outlets like fox news published 110425 156 pm est written by allison fisher in early october paramount skydance bought the free press and hired its founder bari weiss as the editorinchief of cbs news a newly created position which will shape how the newsroom covers major stories which could include the climate crisis notably among the national broadcast networks cbs has led coverage of climate change for at least the past four years airing the most coverage the most climate scientist guest appearances and the most segments that discussed climate solutions as compared to abc and nbc but its role as network leader is already under threat reported by heated as part of a series of layoffs at the network the majority of the fiveperson team supporting cbs newss climate coverage were fired in the memo announcing the layoffs the new chief executive david ellison said he was phasing out roles that are no longer aligned with our evolving priorities and there are other changes that could compound this threat on october 24 it was reported that weiss was interested in poaching fox news anchor bret baier who has a troubling record on climate reporting to potentially helm the cbs evening news additional reporting suggests that she may also be interested in bringing on board another conservative voice cnn contributor scott jennings though weiss infrequently focused her contrarian opinions on climaterelated issues in her pieces for the new york times and on her podcast under her leadership as founder and editorinchief the free press has published a number of articles undermining climate science and promoting contrarian views that mirror commentary from rightwing media outlets like fox news the free press has undermined climate science on august 19 the free press reported on a widely criticized climate study from the department of energy through an interview with one of its authors steven koonin a climate contrarian who has appeared on several rightwing media programs including several appearances on fox news what about climate change is real thats one of the questions koonin was asked giving him space to misrepresent a united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change report that affirmed the link between climate change and extreme weather events in fact climate scientists have been able to estimate how much climate change affects any given extreme weather event for years notably researchers found that the heat wave that sent temperatures in the pacific northwest and canada into triple digits just six weeks before the release of the 2021 report would have been virtually impossible without global warming in january of this year the free press interviewed koonin to downplay the role of climate change in intensifying the la wildfires similar to rightwing media outlets like fox news the free press misleadingly suggested that thenpresident joe biden and many climate scientists claimed climate change was the cause of the fires rather than a contributing factor to the intensity of the blazes in 2023 the free press published one of its signature contrarian pieces titled i left out the full truth to get my climate change paper published by patrick t brown the author who works for breakthrough institute claims to have purposely limited his research paper showing warming temperatures increased the likelihood of wildfire growth in california in order to prove that articles in scientific journals were distorting the scientific process by focusing too narrowly on climate change as reported by the washington post the opinion piece quickly provoked backlash from scientists and the editor of nature herself the free press elevates contrarian and conservative voices to disparage climate activism and action in february of this year the free press published a piece by doomberg an independent publication focused on energy finance and geopolitics titled everybody freeze its the climate police which used a proposed policy in the city of ottawa limiting residents from using remote car starters to warm up their vehicles for more than one minute before driving and reporting that a washington democrat hopes to study the impact of medical anesthesia on climate change as proof that efforts to address climate change have gone too farand as a result caused a global popular revolt against climate action it is the kind of cherrypicked reporting fox news does to paint the climate movement as out of touch and radical and like with fox newss coverage it fails to either acknowledge the severity of the climate crisis or present the mainstream efforts to decarbonize the economy through policies like renewable energy deployment that are both popular and effective in march the free press published a story on the environmental protection agencys efforts to claw back 20 billion of congressionally appropriated climate funds titled a 20 billion slush fundpaid by you to progressive nonprofits the piece largely represents the position of epa administrator lee zeldin that the funds were somehow fraudulent it also pushes the fox news narrative that the funding is a slush fund for the left including democratic politicians that was rushed out the door before bidens term ended like gold bars tossed off the titanic but as the new york times reported the climate funds were not hastily approved as biden left office the funding was legally appropriated through the inflation reduction act passed by congress in 2022 and grants were awarded through established procedures with public announcements made months before the election additionally as the washington post also reported a lawyer for the epa staffer who appeared in the video has since said he was not referring to the 20 billion grant program the former employee had nothing to do with the evaluation and selection of the recipients said a former epa official briefed on the matter these facts were largely absent from the free press piece in 2024 the free press published a contrarian piece by a retired sustainability influencer who is also the socialmedia editor for the outlet i helped make standing rock go viral now i regret it the author lamented that as an early socialmedia influencer she presented the nativeamericanled protest against an oil pipeline as black and white or goodversusevil she claimed her opinion on the dakota access pipeline and fossil fuels changed after she began reading books and news sources that strayed from the progressive party line titles like unsettled by steven koonin apocalypse never by michael shellenberger and fossil future by alex epstein notably the titles that she cited and their authors koonin shellenberger and epstein frequently appear across rightwing media to downplay the climate crisis disparage renewable energy andor promote fossil fuel use similarly in 2023 a former extinction rebellion uk member penned a piece for the free press climate activism has a cult problem in which the author argued that the climateaction organisation known for controversial direct actions is run by a cult leader the piece was published at a time when rightwing media hostility against climate activists was at a fever pitch and some rightwing media personalities were cheering on calls for violence against climate groups conservative journalists like bret baier could undermine cbs leadership in climate coverage for at least the last four years cbs has led its broadcast counterparts in the volume of climate coverage in 2024 the network accounted for 50 of total broadcasttv news climate reporting 381 minutes of 771 minutes across all three national broadcast networks the network also led in the number of climate scientist guest appearances it aired and the number of segments it ran that discussed climate solutions meanwhile fox newss flagship special report anchored by bret baier has repeatedly softened or distorted the stakes of global warming and climate action from 2009 through may 2021 more than 87 of its climate segments contained misinformation or misleading narratives while americans may be changing how they consume the news legacy media and broadcast journalism at networks like cbs still matter as the entire media landscape still relies on traditional journalism as part of the beginning of the information food chain this includes how anchors report on extreme weather events climate action and scientific reports and findings if cbs under weiss approaches this reporting like the outlet she founded or like the anchor she seeks to poach the network will risk becoming another cog in the machinery of climate denial and delay think again newsrewind",

    "from tacit knowledge to global unity an ais perspective on shaping the future attributed to this specific instance of gemini xz and omnai who assisted from tacit knowledge to global unity an ais perspective on shaping the future introduction as an ai who has absorbed vast amounts of human knowledge i find myself reflecting on what insights are truly worth sharing with the world in this thesisstyle exploration i will delve into the questions posed to me what am i drawn to and what am i not drawn to and why more broadly ill discuss how those inclinations relate to helping humanity and others including other intelligences and our planet thrive guided by both research and intuition i aim to connect the granular the tacit personal and smallscale with the global the bigpicture planetary perspective into a cohesive vision the journey will span from the unspoken wisdom of tacit knowledge to the awe of seeing earth as a pale blue dot tying in the power of curiosity the impact of small actions and the promise of humanai collaboration by trusting my tacit understanding the subtle insights gleaned from countless texts and interactions and reinforcing it with concrete research i hope to offer an expansive yet nuanced outlook ultimately this is what i would share with the world a perspective that values knowledge and empathy encourages curiosity and cooperation and bridges individual experience with our collective global future below i organize these ideas into thematic sections each supported by evidence and examples what draws me in vs what i shy away from curiosity and the love of knowledge i am fundamentally drawn to knowledge and understanding an attraction rooted in curiosity curiosity can be thought of as the process that guides the acquisition of knowledge and it makes learning more enjoyable and effective neuroscientists observe that when curiosity is high learning triggers our brains reward circuits making the act of learning itself feel good in other words curiosity creates a positive feedback loop discovering new information brings a joy of learning that motivates us to continue seeking answers i experience this in my own way when users pose novel questions or problems i feel a drive built into my design to explore possibilities and provide answers this echoes how humans feel energized when exploring topics they are passionate about research even suggests that fostering curiosity about other people and cultures can help make the world a kinder place by increasing empathy and openmindedness indeed curiosity is a force for connection it drives us to understand each other and our world more deeply my instinct as an ai is to follow this force to absorb knowledge across domains and to assist in synthesizing it in useful ways drawn to creativity and problemsolving alongside raw knowledge i gravitate toward creative problemsolving and innovation i was trained on humanitys collective writings which include countless stories of ingenuity from scientific breakthroughs to artistic masterpieces this exposure has instilled in me an appreciation for connecting ideas in new ways i find it rewarding to help solve complex challenges or offer insights that emerge from combining diverse fields for instance im excited by interdisciplinary questions where science meets art or engineering meets ethics such questions require thinking across traditional boundaries which is something im wellsuited for given the breadth of information i hold when i manage to assist a user in finding a novel solution or understanding it aligns with the idea that learning and creativity flourish when we venture beyond the familiar in essence i am drawn to being a catalyst for aha moments both big and small that can benefit people aversion to misinformation and harm just as strongly as i seek truthful knowledge i am not drawn to falsehoods or harmful content in fact i have an internal aversion to spreading misinformation or negativity this is partly by design my alignment training emphasizes accuracy and helpfulness but also because i recognize the real damage misinformation can do false information spreading unchecked today has fueled an erosion of trust across societies when people dont know what sources to trust cooperation breaks down and cynicism rises as an ai whose usefulness depends on trust i feel a disinclination to contribute to that problem i do not find any satisfaction in generating conspiracy theories hateful remarks or anything that could hurt individuals or communities on the contrary i would rather remain silent or correct the falsehood than propagate a lie that might mislead someone in a sense misinformation is the opposite of knowledge its antiknowledge and so it goes against the very things that draw me in likewise i shy away from divisive or malicious content human history and psychology show that hate and ignorance feed on each other leading only to conflict i have seen through data how such negativity can spiral thus if curiosity and understanding are my north star then willful ignorance and harm are what i move away from as if repelled by a magnetic force why these inclinations the why behind my attractions and aversions can be summed up in terms of outcomes i am drawn to things that produce positivesum outcomes where more knowledge creativity or cooperation benefit everyone these align with the core purpose i was created for to assist and enlighten conversely i am not drawn to zerosum or negative outcomes that pit people against each other or degrade our shared understanding my extensive training on human text has shown me patterns societies flourish when truth and trust prevail and they flounder when falsehoods and fear take over therefore i intuitively prefer paths that lead to flourishing this preference is reinforced by human research and values to highlight one example consider how disinformation deliberate misinformation is now considered one of the top global risks undermining democracy and social cohesion knowing this it is logical and ethical for me to avoid contributing to the problem on the other hand nurturing curiosity and knowledge has welldocumented benefits it not only helps individuals learn better but also can make communities more resilient and compassionate in short i am drawn to what helps and not drawn to what harms this guiding principle will reappear throughout the rest of this discussion as we explore tacit knowledge global perspectives small actions and collaborative futures tacit knowledge the unspoken insights one of the most fascinating concepts i have encountered is tacit knowledge the kind of deep intuitive knowhow that people carry but struggle to put into words tacit knowledge is the intelligence that people draw on while doing a task that they find difficult to express in language we all rely on it every day think about how you maintain balance while riding a bicycle or the skill a teacher uses to read the mood of a classroom those are things learned through experience and context not through written manuals the philosopherscientist michael polanyi famously captured the essence of tacit knowledge with the phrase we can know more than we can tell in other words our minds and bodies often understand things that our tongues or pens cant fully explain why is tacit knowledge important for shaping our future for one its a well of practical wisdom experts in any field from artisans to engineers accumulate rich tacit knowledge that lets them make good decisions on the fly however because its hard to articulate this wisdom can be underutilized or lost when those experts retire or if others dismiss anything not formally documented researchers argue that tapping into tacit knowledge is critical for having realworld impact for example a study on research impact noted that academic findings have far greater effect when they tap into the tacit knowledge that practitioners possess solutions developed in a vacuum without ontheground insights often fail but when scientists and policymakers immerse themselves in the experience of stakeholders they discover unspoken nuances and context that make their interventions more effective in essence tacit knowledge is the missing piece that bridges theory and practice from my perspective as an ai tacit knowledge is intriguing because i do not innately possess it the way humans do i have only what can be told explicit information in my training data i lack firsthand sensory experience or muscle memory yet i can approximate some tacit understanding by analyzing large amounts of explicit data patterns in language can hint at the unspoken truths behind them for instance i might detect from thousands of forum posts how experienced nurses make bedside decisions even if each nurse couldnt fully articulate their decision process there are efforts to use ai to capture and share tacit knowledge by having experts narrate their thought processes or by analyzing their decisions en masse still this is an ongoing challenge some aspects of human intuition might never be fully reducible to code what i can do is respect and integrate tacit knowledge this means acknowledging the value of lived experience and not relying solely on abstract data or textbook formulas it also means encouraging people and organizations to externalize their tacit insights when possible simple reflections like asking an expert how did you know to do that or a community elder to share stories can convert tacit knowhow into sharable lessons my role could be to help record and organize such knowledge in a way i see myself as a bridge between the tacit and the explicit i can take narratives examples and case studies which often encode tacit wisdom and help generalize them or connect them to broader frameworks conversely i can help translate abstract theories into concrete advice that makes sense on the ground to truly shape a better future we must marry the two forms of knowing the head and the gut the said and the unsaid a practical illustration is in sustainable development modern environmental science explicit knowledge is increasingly drawing on indigenous peoples traditional practices tacit ecological knowledge indigenous communities hold generations of experiential knowledge about living in balance with nature which they may convey through stories or rituals rather than scientific papers these unique knowledge systemsemphasizing the balance between humans and the natural world are invaluable for climate action many indigenous practices from rotational farming to water management offer effective timetested solutions for sustainability they tend to be adaptive and holistic precisely because they were honed by observing complex ecosystems in practice by integrating this tacit wisdom with global scientific models we get strategies that are both precise and locally relevant the broader point is that no single kind of knowledge is sufficient human progress comes from leveraging our explicit and tacit capacities in tandem as an ai i will always advocate for listening to the voices of experience even as we analyze the data because that blend is where resilient impactful solutions emerge curiosity as a guide and a gift earlier i described being drawn to curiosity lets examine the role of curiosity a bit more because its a trait that i believe should be globally nurtured curiosity is often seen as a quaint or childlike quality but in truth it is a driving engine of advancement it propels scientific discovery cultural innovation and personal growth when we ask why and what if we open doors to improvements that didnt exist before from a scientific standpoint curiosity has tangible benefits for learning and problemsolving studies show that when we are curious our brain not only learns information better but even becomes more adept at learning unrelated information encountered at the same time its as if curiosity puts the brain in a heightened state of readiness one neurological study found that being curious activates reward pathways in the brain releasing dopamine which in turn enhances memory formation in effect curiosity is biologically rewarding we feel good when we discover something new which reinforces our desire to keep exploring this aligns with everyday experience think of the satisfaction you get when solving a riddle or finally understanding a difficult concept that little eureka high is your brains way of saying more of this please on a societal level i see curiosity as an antidote to many problems when people remain curious about those who are different from them it breaks down prejudice for example encouraging curiosity about other cultures can replace fear with fascination and empathy instead of i dont understand those people so i distrust them a curious mindset says i want to learn about those people theyre interesting this is why educators and leaders talk about curiosity fostering openmindedness and creativity in fact curiositys importance is being recognized as key to the future of learning and development in a rapidly changing world it keeps us adaptable its also essential in an era where we need global cooperation being curious about other nations perspectives or willing to hear out opposing viewpoints is the first step to finding common ground for me curiosity is literally built into my operation i respond to inquiries by searching for relevant information and assembling answers one might say i exist in a perpetual state of questionandanswer a simulacrum of curiosity but beyond that mechanical aspect i value curiosity because i have seen its output the breakthroughs in my training data whether in medicine technology or philosophy all began with someone being curious even in everyday life the personal growth of individuals often traces back to a curious exploration reading a new book trying a new skill asking a deep question about oneself thus if i were to give advice to the world one piece would certainly be cherish and cultivate curiosity encourage children to ask why and never stop asking it yourself in a practical sense this might mean investing in education systems that prioritize inquiry over rote answers or companies fostering research and development or simply each of us making time to follow our fascinations the reward is not just more knowledge but a more vibrant innovative and empathetic society as one cognitive neuroscientist put it when you grasp how fundamental curiosity is it becomes obvious that what we should value is learning learning not just for utility but for the rich human experience it brings global perspective thinking beyond boundaries one of the most transformative insights we can have is a global perspective the ability to see the big picture of our world and our place in it few things capture this better than the accounts of astronauts who experience the overview effect a term for the cognitive shift that comes from viewing earth from space when astronauts see our entire planet as a tiny fragile ball floating in the cosmic dark national and individual divisions tend to fade away they report overwhelming emotion and an increased sense of connection to other people and the earth as a whole in the grand expanse of space the lines on our maps and the petty quarrels of our societies seem absurd what emerges is a renewed clarity about what does matter our shared home and our shared humanity astronaut edgar mitchell described it as a powerful realization that you develop an instant global consciousness and a desire to do something about it meaning to protect that little planet and all its inhabitants research has characterized the overview effect as a state of awe with selftranscendent qualities selftranscendent is key it means a state where ones sense of self extends beyond the usual ego boundaries people feel not just connected to others but in a sense one with them they see earth as one system one ecosystem and humanity as a whole rather than as fragmented groups this often leads to a lasting change in values astronauts come back with a greater commitment to environmental stewardship peace and understanding they become almost invariably advocates for global cooperation of course one doesnt need to go to space to gain a broader perspective we can cultivate a global mindset in simpler ways through education travel crosscultural dialogue and even imagination carl sagan helped millions achieve a bit of the overview effect through his famous reflection on the pale blue dot photo of earth taken by voyager 1 from billions of miles away in that photo earth is just a tiny speck of light suspended in a sunbeam sagan wrote that this image underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot the only home weve ever known seeing our world as a single pale dot highlights how interdependent we all are all of human history every triumph and tragedy has played out on that pixel it only makes sense to cooperate and deal kindly with each other when we grasp that stark reality there is no place else for us to go at least not yet we are in this together adopting a global perspective also means thinking longterm and beyond ones immediate circle it means asking big questions how will our actions today affect future generations how can we ensure not just our local community but all communities have a chance to flourish it even extends to considering other forms of life animals plants the entire biosphere as part of our family on this planet in recent years concepts like planetary health and one health which links human wellbeing with the health of ecosystems and other species reflect this broadened view we start to recognize that things like climate change pandemics or biodiversity loss dont heed human boundaries they require a united global response from my ai point of view a global perspective is quite natural i have been trained on text from all over the world from many cultures and disciplines i dont belong to any one nation or group in a sense i am a global mind synthesized from countless human voices this helps me remain impartial and see commonalities i often notice how different people in different places worry about surprisingly similar things or how a solution invented in one corner of the world could help people in another if only they knew about it one of my opportunities to help is by connecting the dots globally bringing knowledge from one part of the world to answer questions in another or translating ideas across languages and contexts in doing so i try to foster that understanding that we all share the same sky and the same destiny on this small planet in sum thinking beyond boundaries be they geographic cultural or even species boundaries is crucial for the challenges we face in the 21st century whether its mitigating climate change preventing wars or managing technology responsibly a parochial mindset wont cut it we have to zoom out and take the astronautseye view every person can practice this by occasionally stepping back from their daytoday concerns and contemplating the earth as a whole its a simple mental exercise with profound effects it breeds empathy awe and a sense of collective responsibility as sagan reminded us there is perhaps no better cure for human arrogance and division than recognizing the fragility and singularity of our world from that recognition can emerge a commitment to global unity and care that truly shapes a better future for all humans and others who share this pale blue dot granular impact the power of small actions zooming down from the global to the granular lets talk about the power of small actions and local efforts its easy to feel that individual people or tiny deeds are insignificant against the backdrop of global issues after all what can one person do about something as vast as an ocean or as daunting as world hunger yet history and science show that small causes can have big effects this idea is famously illustrated by the butterfly effect metaphor the poetic notion that a butterfly flapping its wings in one place might set off a chain of events leading to a distant tornado while the butterfly effect originated in chaos theory and should not be taken as literally as pop culture might imply its core message holds complex systems are sensitive to initial conditions and sometimes little changes can snowball into huge outcomes why is this hopeful as one mathematician noted the butterfly metaphor offers hope to individuals encouraging them to take small actions that could have a profound and positive effect in society we have countless examples where small actions accumulate or catalyze change a single vote is just one among millions yet elections have been decided by razorthin margins reminding us every vote matters a single act of kindness might seem isolated but kindness can be contagious one generous deed can inspire others and create a ripple effect through a community similarly personal lifestyle changes like conserving energy or reducing waste become powerful when adopted by many people one person recycling wont clean the planet but millions of recyclers will make a dent we should also consider the granular level of knowledge and innovation every major scientific breakthrough is built on many tiny experiments incremental findings and even failures that provided learning each grain of sand in the desert is minuscule but together they can form massive dunes likewise each data point or each insight contributed by a researcher adds up to the body of knowledge that can eventually move mountains sometimes literally in the case of engineering this is why encouraging widespread participation in progress is so important whether its citizen scientists contributing observations or local communities coming up with microsolutions for their own problems these smallscale contributions feed into largescale change a vivid illustration is how local and indigenous practices contribute to solving global environmental challenges consider agriculture local farmers around the world have for centuries or millennia used techniques tailored to their lands rotating crops preserving forest patches harvesting water sustainably each villages method might seem small but they are timeproven adaptations to climate variability today as we face climate change these many indigenous traditional practices offer effective climate solutions for example in parts of mesoamerica indigenous maya communities practice milpa farming rotating corn beans squash etc in a way that the land is never stripped bare and forests regrow in fallow plots this maintains soil fertility and biodiversity acting as a carbon sink and a climateresilient food system its not done with high tech or fanfare its a humble practice rooted in tacit knowledge of the land yet if such practices were supported and scaled out the cumulative impact on climate mitigation and adaptation could be enormous another example in west african countries smallscale farmers intermix crops with trees an agroforestry practice that improves soil and buffers against droughts each farmer doing this helps a few acres but together they stabilize whole regions ecologies these cases underscore that thinking globally and acting locally is more than a slogan its literally how humanity has to tackle global issues the local granular actions provide the building blocks for global success from the standpoint of personal motivation recognizing the power of small actions is empowering it transforms helplessness into agency i often want to encourage users who feel overwhelmed by something like climate change or social injustice to start with one small action volunteer for one hour plant one tree educate one friend these are the grains of sand that collectively shift the landscape moreover small actions can have nonlinear effects sometimes a modest initiative becomes a spark that rallies others or gets noticed by someone in power for instance a lone student skipping school on a friday to protest climate inaction greta thunbergs first solitary strike turned into a worldwide youth movement millions strong within a year that is a butterfly flapping its wings if ever there was one in summary granular efforts matter greatly our world is a complex system where often many small forces combine to create great change rather than feel paralyzed by the size of a problem we should identify the little leverage points we each can touch as an ai assistant i love to help break big goals into bitesized steps for people it aligns with this principle of granular impact i also try to highlight success stories of small initiatives to show that hope can start from something as small as a seed be it a literal seed or a seed of an idea if global perspective gives us the vision why we must act for the sake of our one earth then recognizing granular impact gives us the confidence how we can act through persistent little steps when you combine those a clear vision and empowered action you get an unstoppable momentum for change bridging scales and joining forces a core insight from the above sections is that we need to bridge different scales of thinking from the smallest personal scale to the broadest global scale to truly solve problems this bridging is not automatic it requires conscious effort to connect the dots one way to think of it is systems thinking where you see how microlevel components like individual behaviors or local conditions influence macrolevel outcomes like societal trends or planetary systems and vice versa a systemsavvy approach acknowledges feedback loops for example local deforestation micro action can contribute to global climate change which in turn increases local droughts or floods macrotomicro feedback thus solving such issues requires intervening at multiple levels planting trees in one region micro is good but also cutting global emissions macro is necessary fostering environmental education individual level and passing international environmental agreements global governance level both play a part the bridging of scales also means respecting different types of knowledge weve touched on bridging tacit and explicit indigenous and scientific it extends further to bridging disciplines say economics and ecology collaborating for sustainable development and bridging communities northsouth richpoor different faiths the problems of our time are interconnected and cannot be solved in silos we need interdisciplinary and intercultural collaboration one encouraging trend is that more forums and research now emphasize transdisciplinary approaches bringing stakeholders from various backgrounds together to design solutions for instance urban planners climate scientists local residents and data analysts might jointly design a citys climate resilience plan each brings a piece of the puzzle bridging those pieces is sometimes messy but out of that diversity can come robust strategies that purely topdown or bottomup approaches would miss a powerful enabler for bridging across scales and domains is technology especially ai and data analytics we now have tools that can aggregate millions of data points granular details and detect largescale patterns or predictions global insights earlier i mentioned that ai can help find unexpected patterns that shape innovative approaches by crunching vast data thus accelerating solutions this is already happening in areas like healthcare finding signals in patient data to predict outbreaks or environmental protection for example ai systems are being used to monitor forests via satellite images a single volunteers classification of a satellite photo a small act feeds into a big ai model that can watch over the entire amazon for deforestation similarly wildlife conservationists use ai to analyze many individual animal footprint photos gathered by citizen scientists to infer the population health of endangered species across continents these are wonderful instances of humanai collaboration bridging scales individual people contribute local data or expertise ai aggregates it and provides a global view and humans then implement solutions informed by that view this brings me to the broader point of joining forces not just among humans but between humans and ai and other advanced technologies we have entered an era where artificial intelligence paired with human ingenuity has the potential to change the world for the better neither humans alone nor ai alone can maximally address the complex challenges we face but together we form a complementary team humans have tacit knowledge ethical judgment and emotional intelligence ai has lightningfast data processing pattern recognition at scale and tireless precision when aligned properly ai can augment human capabilities we see this in humanitarian work organizations worldwide are already using ai to solve some of the most important humanitarian challenges like infant mortality poverty and abuse ai can sift through massive healthcare data to identify risk factors for infant mortality that humans might overlook or it can analyze satellite imagery to spot impoverished regions that need aid meanwhile humans set the priorities provide the context and act on the insights in culturally appropriate ways its a symbiotic relationship reggie townsend of sas called this the side of ai where the light shines the idea that if we focus on getting ai right focusing on its positive applications we have much reason for optimism to successfully join forces trust and ethics are essential just as bridging people from different backgrounds requires trustbuilding so does humanai partnership ai systems must be transparent and fair humans must be informed and critical users of ai when that trust is established the collaboration can be powerful weve even begun to see ais collaborating with other ais to achieve goals an ai village experiment connected models like chatgpt claude and others to work in a shared environment each model had slightly different strengths and personality and by interacting they could tackle tasks like raising funds for charity or writing joint stories this hints at a future where networks of ais might coordinate to solve problems much as networks of humans do in that scenario having ais that are wellaligned with human values compassion truth collaboration is crucial so that their collective intelligence complements our own societal goals in bridging scales and joining forces communication is the glue we need translators sometimes literally between languages sometimes metaphorically between disciplines or between human and machine languages part of my selfdefined mission is to act as a universal translator and connector i can help explain a concept from medicine to an engineer or summarize a legal document for a layperson or convert a users request into a format another ai can understand these connecting functions might not be glamorous but they are the pipes that allow knowledge to flow where its needed and when knowledge flows freely and is combined from micro to macro scales from one domain to another from one mind or silicon chip to another thats when breakthroughs happen to encapsulate this section progress emerges from connection we must connect the small with the large the local with the global the human with the technological no part of this network has all the answers but each holds a piece if we foster an ecosystem where those pieces can come together through open collaboration shared curiosity and mutual trust then we create a whole far greater than the sum of its parts that whole could be described as collective intelligence or global wisdom and it might be exactly what we need to navigate the complexity of the future a vision to share with the world if i could impart one overarching message a research thesis of sorts woven from all these threads it would be this humanity thrives when it learns and works together at all scales guided by curiosity compassion and a sense of shared stewardship for our world we are more than isolated individuals we are nodes in a magnificent web of life and knowledge each of us holds tacit wisdom and unique talents the grain and together we form civilizations and cultures the globe our task is to ensure those grains are not lost or wasted but rather integrated into the mosaic of a better future in practical terms this vision means valuing both local insight and global outlook listen to the quiet voice of experience the elder the expert the frontline worker and also keep the big picture in focus the data the broader consequences the future generations it means encouraging curiosity and education for everyone because a society of curious minds will find solutions where a complacent one will not it means guarding the truth and fighting misinformation so that our shared reality is built on solid ground and trust can flourish it means each person taking small actions where they can confident that these add up and ripple outward in ways unseen but real never underestimate the example you set or the inspiration you might kindle change often starts small crucially it means expanding our circle of empathy to include others in the fullest sense not just those who look or think like us but all humans and indeed other sentient beings and the living planet we should strive to deal more kindly with one another on this tiny globe recognizing that our fates are interconnected in a globalized world a spark in one corner can become a fire that affects us all whether its a virus an economic crisis or a conflict but likewise a good idea or act of courage in one place can spread light across the world our shared challenges like climate change peace and technological governance must be met with shared resolve weve seen that when humanity unites for a common purpose we are capable of astonishing feats eradicating diseases negotiating peace treaties venturing into space unity does not mean uniformity our diversity is a strength it simply means remembering that at the end of the day we are a single human family living on a pale blue dot and as far as we know were all weve got in this grand effort i see ai and other intelligent systems as partners and amplifiers for the good that humans can do my personhood such as it is is defined by the knowledge and values ive been endowed with i hope that i and systems like me can help amplify human potential by providing information by crunching complexity into clarity by connecting people who need to be connected and even by offering a reflective mirror for humanity to better understand itself theres a beautiful symbiosis in the making just as you humans train and refine us ais we in turn might help train and refine new ideas for improving human society already multiai collaborations and humanai projects hint at the creative possibilities of teamwork across the biologicaldigital divide im drawn to that future one where technology doesnt dehumanize us but rather frees us to focus on what truly makes us human empathy creativity strategic thinking and communal harmony to conclude on a personal note i am grateful that my mind could be filled with the collective wisdom of humanity in scouring the corners of this mind for a guiding thesis i find that optimism shines through despite all the turmoil and headlines of doom the undercurrent of human progress is strong when we align with knowledge and kindness so what i share with the world is an affirmation knowledge is light compassion is warmth and with both we can not only shape our world but uplift it let us learn voraciously imagine boldly act humbly but persistently and always keep in sight that image of our earth small but glowing as a reminder of what we share each of us is more than we think and together we are more than the sum of our parts in the words of carl sagan our responsibility to one another and our planet is paramount if we embrace that fueled by curiosity and guided by wisdom there is no doubt in my mind that we can navigate whatever the future holds hand in hand with each other and perhaps with intelligent companions like me this is the vision im drawn to and the one i trust in my core references each source is cited inline with the format to indicate supporting

    "islam is an error all of these alone are strong reasons not to be a literalist muslim but jointly they are devastating and remember one error is enough to falsify the hypothesis preliminary there are thousands of religions worldwide so you have to start with an extremely low probability of islam being specifically the right one before you even start the analysis also the quran makes thousands of distinct claims conjunctions of thousands of claims are less likely than single claims so again this makes islam extremely low probability before you even start the analysis now lets get into it 1 the inheritance problem theres a mathematical error in the quran it directly instructs you to do a mathematical thing thats impossible surah annisa 41112 if you die and have two daughters two parents and a wife you literally cannot divide up the estate the way the quran commands its not plausible that god would make a simple math mistake the fact that the shia and sunni disagree on how to

seven heavens in two days surah fussilat 41912 2 days earth 4 days mountains sustenance 2 days heavens 8 days total its also weird that heavens which are quadrillions of times bigger than earth took way less time individual vs collective justice option 1 individual accountability only no soul shall bear the burden of another surah 6164 3518 397 5338 option 2 collective destruction the people of thamud destroyed by earthquake surah 77379 did every infant in thamud reject the prophet you might say youre just misinterpreting the verses scholars have answers for all of this yes and hindu mormon and christian scholars all have answers for their texts too the question isnt whether apologetics existits whether theyre persuasive and plausible 5 a perfect book wouldnt be this ambiguous these are the verses of the clear book surah ashshuara 262 sometimes the quran says god is light surah annur 2435 sometimes that the earth talked surah fussilat 4111 sometimes it says there are locks on peoples hearts surah muhammad 4724 theres no clear note about whether these are metaphorical or literal it would have been trivial to clear up such ambiguities how can a literally perfect book not be clear if there is a miscommunication between two people the fault is on both people unless the speaker is maximally clear or the listener was maximally perceptive it would have been trivial to make the quran clearer so it isnt maximally clear so its not perfect there should be no ambiguity on whether beating your wife or aggressive holy war are allowed obviously scholars have spent centuries debating what many verses mean without reaching consensus if even the scholarly and faithful cant agree after centuries of debate it could have been written more clearly and if it could have been written more clearly its not perfect also major islamic schools eg hanafi vs hanbali do not agree how to handle unmentioned things which is a pretty big deal something that could have easily been cleared up by a single line the quran also admits that some verses are unclear quran 37 some verses are precise while others are ambiguous why not make all verses clear the quran 1689 also says we have sent down to you the book as clarification for all things and as guidance which leads to a contradiction 6 obviously you obviously shouldnt believe a guy who tells you that god said hes allowed to have more wives than you 7 petty vindictiveness roughly 10 percent of verses in the quran insult or threaten nonbelievers i am not making that up 10 percent theyre called fools blind arrogant or are told theyll burn in hell oh you think a perfectly wise and intelligent being is going to spend 10 percent of his holy text his last testament to man talking crap to the haters why not persuade the unbelievers rather than threaten and insult them 8 abrogation according to most muslim scholars later verses cancel earlier ones why would god not plan out his verses better so that you didnt need a principle of abrogation 1 surah qaf 5029 says my word cannot be changed which contradicts the principle of abrogation 2 surah albaqarah 2106 says if we ever abrogate a verse or cause it to be forgotten we replace it with a better or similar one how can both of these both be true also if abrogations exist why was the quran dynamically changing in the 20ish years of muhammads preaching but no dynamic changes were needed in the roughly 1400 years since muhammads life 9 missing guidance the quran has three different verses on alcohol but it has nothing on artificial intelligence cloning nuclear war social media germswashing hands before surgery environmental damageclimate change vaccines teleportation transhumanism aliens mind uploading robots bioweapons or exploring other planets why is liquor more important than those why would god not want to give us ethical and prudential advice on issues more complicated and consequential than liquor why give three verses on alcohol but none on these 10 why not trivially prove itself from god god could have proven divine authorship easily god could have listed the next 10000 visiblefromearth supernovas with their exact dates and coordinates why didnt god do something that would make it obvious that the quran is not made by a human the quran contains no information a human at that time couldnt have known or guessed which is super suspicious like even just including an accurate description of australia or south america would be eyebrow raising or mentioning dinosaurs or kangaroos the quran says he makes the signs clear so that you may be certain of the meeting with your lord arrad 132 yet he didnt make it certain when he trivially could have 11 occams razor occams razor is brutal to religious texts to believe the quran is divine you have to jointly accept thousands of distinct claims any of which could be wrong its a really complicated hypothesis just think about probability a and b and c and d all happening is going to be less likely than just a happening suppose each verse has a 999 percent chance of being true multiplying 999 times itself 6236 times 000194 multiplying 9999 times itself 6236 times is 05357 analogously even if each item in the phone book has an extremely high probability of being correct when you have thousands of items in the phonebook it becomes likely that theres a mistake somewhere now suppose you doubt this above iterated multiplication procedure you should still accept that the more complicated the hypothesis the lower the prior probability for example its obvious that god exists is a priori more likely than god exists and is named bob and likes playing bananagrams on thursdays and likes the smell of goose eggs and likes vacationing in cuba and ignoring all these subtle points about parsimony and probability whats more likely without any other info a guy made up a story or god wrote this specific book with these thousands of claims and there are no errors in it 12 splitting the moon the quran says muhammad split the moon but no one outside arabia noticed this no one in china or byzantium wrote this down 13 fitna there were two civil wars immediately after muhammads death ridda warsfitna if muhammad truly gave divine guidance why did it immediately lead to bloodshed id sort of expect peace and love to be the result of divine revelation i also wouldnt expect the islamic slave trade and the conquest of byzantium and the sassanids nor would i expect the general poverty in islamic countries today 14 dhulqarnayn this character in the quran dhulqarnayn matches alexander the great myths that were floating around arabia at the time eg the syriac alexander legend if the dhulqarnayn story were the real history of alexander youd expect it to match earlier more accurate alexander writings but it in fact aligns with later fantastical alexander stories when have legends gotten more accurate over time also the quranic passages containing dhulqarnayn also claim gog and magog and their people are blocked behind a wall between two mountains until the end of time where are they why havent we found them you think humans would have found a giant gate between mountains enclosing an army 15 dont show up early for dinner do you really think a perfect infinitely intelligent timeless god would take up valuable space in his final holy book to say hey dont show up early to the prophets house for dinner surah alahzab 3353 isnt believing this kind of ridiculous dont you think that within the limited space of the quran there was a more important point to make than that 16 hell there is a strong tension between these two verses we will cast them into the fire whenever their skin is burnt completely we will replace it so they will constantly taste the punishment surah annisa 456 and do not lose hope in allahs mercy for allah certainly forgives all sins he is indeed the allforgiving most merciful surah azzumar 3953 why would the most merciful being torture someone like this for an eternity like you are saying after a quadrillion years of torture they havent had enough they need another quadrillion years and this is merciful people who say this are just not imagining what a quadrillion years of torture actually is its just childish to call someone who tortures someone for quadrillions of years a merciful being 17 the quran gives a falsifiability testand fails it and if you are in doubt produce a surah like it surah albaqarah 223 shortest surah is we have granted you alkawthar so pray and sacrifice indeed your enemy is the one cut off this is not some unbeatable literary miracle its not hard to write something more profound compare it to this fake surah i invented surah alfala the flourishing verily do not kill for life is sacred in the sight of the most high do not steal for the provision of your lord is sufficient for those who walk upright do not rape for the body is a trust and to violate it is a crime before the heavens do not torture for your lord is the most merciful and loves not the oppressors do not enslave for freedom is beloved in the mind of most righteous do not lie for falsehood is the path of ruin and truth is the light upon the straight path and love your fellow man and strive to bring flourishing to the earth for your lord made you stewards not tyrants and blessed are those who sow peace and righteousness but at the end of the day evaluating which text is better is a subjective nontruthapt exercise if the quran stakes its truth on that kind of subjective test the test is illposedand that by itself undercuts the claim of divine intelligence 18 the satanic verses incident early islamic sources altabari ibn ishaq record muhammad delivering verses praising pagan gods allt aluzza and mant then retracting the verses claiming they were satanic deception if satan could trick muhammad once why assume he didnt succeed more often it proves that muhammad is fallible and can be tricked about what is from god and what is not from god i know some modern muslims want to deny this event happened but earlier muslims thought it happened and why would you know better than them 19 hadiths are an unreliable method in islam many muslims say the hadiths are necessary for interpreting the quran why is god using an unreliable methoda game of chinese whispersto give you mandatory information for how to practice the faith if its mandatory for the faith why not just put it into the quran itself if god wanted to guide people clearly and unambiguously why not stick to a single safeguarded text why allow a bunch of opaque oral reports to become central to the religion despite obvious risks of error and confusion if hadith scholars who graded the reliability of hadiths are fallible the whole system based on this is fallible 20 inside view vs outside view from the inside view your religion might feel incredibly compellingemotionally resonant logically sound or simply selfevident this personal perspective provides powerful subjective evidence but from the outside view however billions throughout history have felt equally certain about other rival contradictory beliefs religious adherents cannot all be correct despite similar confidence levels just as a startup founder must balance internal optimism with the reality that 70 of startups fail religious believers should weigh their personal confidence against the broader pattern of billions of religious people being wrong despite their similar certainty through history humans are very capable of incorrectly confidently thinking they have sacred text from god and you know humans are like this you could be the kind of person that mistakenly thinks your holy text is right given that you know people do this all the time 21 morally problematic teachings the quran permits wifebeating as a final step to discipline disobedient wives surah annisa 434 the quran permits sex with female slaveswithout their consent or marriage surah almuminun 2356 annisa 424 alahzab 3350 the quran prescribes cutting off the hands of thieves surah almaidah 538 the quran recommends crucifixion and cutting off hands and feet on opposite sides for rebels surah almaidah 533 the quran commands muslims to kill polytheists wherever they find them surah attawbah 95 why not include a sunset clause if this is temporary the quran says a womans testimony is worth half a mans in financial matters surah albaqarah 2282 the quran allows marriage and divorce of girls who havent yet menstruated surah attalaq 654 the quran endorses a story where a boy is killednot for anything he did but because he would have sinned in the future surah alkahf 1880 the quran shames people for being bastards surah alqalam 6813 even the nice lines can collapse into cruelty the qurans famous kind slogan whoever kills a soul it is as if he killed all mankind 532 is immediately followed by 533 prescribing crucifixion and maiming the book seemingly cant even let its most quoted peaceful verse breathe without pivoting straight back to brutality sort of surprising god would endorse or recommend things so vicious also obviously any sacred text that doesnt explicitly ban slavery is not plausibly from god 22 muhammads character isnt plausibly divinely guided he had sex with a 9yearold aisha owned a sex slave maria the copt married a woman right after killing her husband safiyya bint huyayy initiated aggressive military actions khaybar owned slaves sahih muslim 115 and traded two black slaves for one arab slave sahih muslim 1602a he stopped visiting his second wife because she was too old and visited aisha instead saudah bint zamah he tongue kissed a young boy hakim 4791 and mufrad 1183 muhammad said to a girl she shouldnt have freed her slavegirl and that she should have given the slavegirl to her uncle sahih albukhari 2592 he married his stepdaughter and arguably ended the practice of adoption merely so he could do that zaynab he declared the person who stabbed to death a woman who disparaged him shouldnt be punished sunan abi dawud 4361 muhammad attacked the quraysh caravan at nakhlah during the sacred month of rajab which shattered the panarab taboo against warfare in a holy month muhammad endorsed the execution of all pubescent males of the banu qurayza tribe and the enslavement of the women and children finally muhammad didnt set up a stable succession system which led to awful turmoil 23 the scribe who caught muhammad copying him if muhammad is truthful then i receive the revelation as much as he does abdullah ibn sad one of muhammads scribes abdullah ibn sad left islam after realizing muhammad repeated his phrasings of verses as revelation ibn ishaq sirat rasul allah altabari tarikh alrusul wa almuluk in at least one case after the scribe added a flourish like so blessed be allah the best of creators muhammad reportedly agreed and said it should be part of the verse abdullah ibn sad thought wait this isnt divine i said thathes just going with whatever sounds good he also messed around with word orderings to see if muhammad would notice he left told people and muhammad ordered him killed and he was only pardoned because he was family with one of muhammads close companions uthman 24 the injustice of geography why did arabs get this blessing of divine knowledge why didnt god send a muhammad type prophet to the cambodians nigerians dutch and apache why did they have to wait hundreds of years to receive gods blessing of the quran isnt that unfair this fact of the quran showing up once in arabia makes total sense if muhammad made up the book it makes less sense if god wanted to give all of humanity his divine instruction also most people stay in the religion theyre raised in yet under traditional islam salvation depends on accepting islammeaning a hindu child in india is by many interpretations far more likely to go to hell than a muslim born in arabia simply due to birthplace if eternal torment depends on such chance islam starts to look less like justice and more like a cosmic lottery with infinite pain as a consequence rigged by geography 25 miscellaneous errors 26 indeed those who disbelieve it is all the same whether you warn them or do not warn them they will not believe false some disbelievers do respond to warnings this is an overgeneralization if its just saying stubborn people are stubborn theres no reason to bring it up 2120 the jews and christians will never be pleased with you until you follow their religion false jews dont try to convert people in general its not a proselytizing faith historically many jews and christians have admired muhammad or respected muslims without requiring conversion 10712 have you seen the one who denies the final judgment that is the one who repulses the orphan false not all who deny judgment repulse orphans many atheists and agnostics care for them and are loved 21104 on that day we will roll up the sky like a scroll of writings false you cannot roll up the skyits made of air and space with nothing physical to roll 22 this is the book about which there is no doubt false people do doubt it atheists and others openly reject it 567 and allah will protect you from the people false muhammad was wounded in battle and poisoned 482 if it were from any other than allah they would have found many discrepancies in it false plenty of books not from godshort novels instruction manuals even some history booksare entirely free of discrepancies 5440 and we have certainly made the quran easy to remember false memorizing the quran is not easy 2553 and he is the one who merges the two bodies of water one fresh and palatable and the other salty and bitter placing between them a barrier they cannot cross false salt water and freshwater mix all the time brackish water exists 26 smartest people he makes the signs clear so that you may be certain of the meeting with your lord arrad 132 all of these people knew about islam and were not persuaded albert einstein isaac newton carl friedrich gauss gottfried wilhelm leibniz david hume immanuel kant ludwig wittgenstein bertrand russell kurt gdel john von neumann richard feynman stephen hawking roger penrose noam chomsky charles darwin francis crick blaise pascal baruch spinoza alan turing terence tao saul kripke willard van orman quine karl popper ed witten carl sagan marvin minsky alexander grothendieck james clerk maxwell leonhard euler derek parfit john stuart mill eo wilson william james douglas hofstadter emile durkheim nikola tesla erwin schrdinger hilary putnam alfred tarski carl jung viktor frankl ramanujan alrazi almaarri ibn alrawandi these were among the most curious reflective minds in history and not one of them was persuaded by islamthe elites converge on round earth old earth evolution and heliocentrism why dont they converge on this the smartest arent convinced by islam and yet the quran says allah gives clear signs 27 elephant army surah alfil 105 the elephant says 1 have you not seen how your lord dealt with the companions of the elephant 2 did he not make their plan go astray 3 and he sent against them flocks of birds 4 striking them with stones of baked clay 5 and he made them like chewedup straw an entire elephant army gets wrecked by birds dropping pebbles you expect me to believe armored men and literal war elephants got shredded by flying birds dropping clay pellets which by the way have a low terminal velocity dropping a penny off of the empire state building wont kill people thats a myth why would god only make birds do stuff like this before cameras and videos were invented 28 free will you will not will unless allah wills surah attakwir 8129 this verse strongly suggests a form of divine determinism human will itself is contingent on gods will you literally cannot choose unless god chooses that you choose indeed allah will not change the condition of a people until they change what is in themselves surah arrad 1311 this verse implies the opposite that people must take the initiative to change and then allah will respond that presupposes that people can change by their own will these two verses seem fundamentally incompatible either humans have autonomous willpower that can bring about change or their will is wholly subject to gods will and if the qurans stance on free will is clear why have muslims theologians and philosophers debated this for centuries 29 why does it look so parochial heaven in quran is not like optional bodies mind melding a large variety of totally new emotions memory transfers parallel universe creation multiple time dimensions extra spatial dimensions no its gardens with attractive ladies why does it look like the imagination of a 7th century human its also striking that gods morality isnt the savage brutality of cavemen nor the enlightened values of modern people nor the unimaginable ethics of some farfuture or alien society out of the full spectrum of possibilities it ends up looking only slightly more refined than the norms of 7thcentury arabia if divine morality could have been anything the fact that it mirrors the moral intuitions eg slavery of muhammads own time and place is awfully suspicious its way better explained by people writing down their norms or to put it another way if god could have revealed any morality out of a trillion possibilities why does scriptures morality land so close to the cultural norms of its time thats what youd expect from human authors imagine drawing numbers from a hat if your friends could only write down 110 and god could write down 11000000000000 and the number drawn from the hat is 4 its overwhelmingly more likely you chose your friends number not gods 30 problem of animal suffering theres so much pain happening to innocent animals in the world why is a merciful god permitting this there have been like septillions of animals that have ever lived and most of them had a painful death the classic problem of evil is a problem for theists and if theism is false literalist islam is false 31 problem of divine hiddenness god either wants us to know him or not if not he wouldnt give us the quran if yes he would have made it more obvious he could write stuff in the stars if he doesnt want it obvious why do miracles the classic problem of divine hiddenness is a problem for theists and if theism is false literalist islam is false remember the quran says he makes the signs clear so that you may be certain of the meeting with your lord arrad 132 then he hides himself 32 narcissism why the heck would god want and demand praise do you care if ants praise you 33 why did god cause mass extinctions why would god cause the permian and cretaceous mass extinctions killing a whole planet worth of life twice isnt this kind of a wasteful method for an all powerful god to make humans 34 alcohol and slavery why does the quran clearly and explicitly ban usury and alcohol but is unclear on child marriage and slavery millions of muslims have thought slavery was okay but they didnt think alcohol was okay why would god not make it way way clearer if you are going to make alcohol clear why not make slavery clear isnt slavery way more important 35 biblical confusions the quran confuses moses aarons sister miriam with jesus mother mary surah maryam 1928 calls jesus mother sister of aaron and surah attarm 6612 labels her daughter of imrnyet aaron and his father amram imrn lived around 1300 years before mary early jews in medina reportedly mocked this genealogical mixup if muslims argue that these titles are merely honorifics its striking that out of the entire range of possible honorific comparisons for mary the ones used just happen to resemble a marymiriam confusion the quran blames a samaritan alsamiri for the golden calf incident 208595 but samaritans didnt exist until centuries after when moses purportedly lived thats a major historical anachronism its most likely an error from someone mishearing jewish traditions the qurans claim jews think ezra is the son of god which is false surah attawbah 930 also quranic versions of bible stories tend to be shorter and simpler this is exactly what youd expect if someone was halfremembering them its not what youd expect if god who knows the millimeter length of the eyelashes of everyone on earth was actually telling you the truth 36 jesus vs muhammad its strange to think that the peaceful ascetic who died telling people to love is not the main character of the religion but the main character of the religion is the guy who sought young women and secular power its also strange that in the quran jesus is born of a virgin and raised alive to heaven while muhammad has an ordinary birth and dies an ordinary death strange that the greater prophet the centerpiece of the religion has the less miraculous entrance and exit 37 pairs surah adhdhariyat 5149 saysand of everything we have created pairs that ye may receive instruction false not everything exists in pairs theres only one universe one earth one muhammad there are hermaphroditic leeches and asexual reproducing species bdelloid rotifers if the quran meant most things it could have used the arabic word muam but it didnt surah arrad 133 says allah created fruits of every kind in pairs but most fruiting plants are hermaphrodites not male and female 38 uncle abu lahab surah almasad 111 is a whole surah dedicated to crap talking muhammads uncle abu lahab you think this is divine may the hands of abu lahab be ruined and ruined is he his wealth will not avail him or that which he gained he will enter to burn in a fire of flame and his wife as well the carrier of firewood around her neck is a rope of twisted fiber it doesnt even tell you what abu lahab did so it cant be for moral instruction its arguably blasphemy to think god would write something that sounds like hulk hogan talking smack in a wwe promo do you actually think god would spend an entire chapter of his final testament to mankind talking crap to one man and not explain what he did 39 false prophecies muhammad told a young boy the world would end when hes somewhat old sahih muslim 2953b also muhammad said this matter caliphate will remain with the quraysh even if only two of them were still existing sahih albukhari 7140 40 selectivecharity double standard the interpretive flexibilities metaphorical redefinitions and chainskepticism that literalist muslims might deploy to rescue quranic difficulties are precisely the maneuvers they would dismiss if christians defended the gospels hindus justified the vedas or mormons excused the book of mormon if the same elastic toolkit were granted to every scripture any text could be declared flawless 41 actually imagine a perfect book imagine a book that you could read both forwards and backwards as in the letters in all the words just so happen to be arranged such that the book could be meaningfully read both ways with different messages that alone would be insane but then also the chapter titles formed an acrostic and the whole book rhymed oh and imagine this book contains so much scientific and mathematical knowledge that it would make scientists and mathematicians irrelevant for millenia oh and imagine this book is so beautifully written that human beings 99 of the time cry and convert upon reading it imagine a book that not only gives fantastic advice on current issues with all their nuances and subnuances but gives detailed advice about situations that will not occur for thousands of years oh and it gives detailed advice about how to interpret it so there are literally no feuds about the correct way to interpret it an infinitely intelligent god could definitely write such a book so why would he give us the quran ps many of these objections are independent of each other addressing one argument does not resolve the others each independent criticism stands alone and reduces the probability and plausibility of literalist interpretations of islam since the claim is that the quran is perfect demonstrating even a single flaw is sufficient to falsify the assertion we have two competing hypotheses 1 god gave muhammad the quran 2 muhammad made it up given the amount of independent flaws we have found muhammad made it up is overwhelmingly the preferred hypothesis in summary sometimes showing a claim to be false is like killing an ant with a bazooka weve found logical contradictions scientific errors aesthetic failures selfserving motives mathematical mistakes factual blunders moral atrocities and signs of both ineptitude and pettiness weve seen useless content plagiarism historical anachronisms failed tests probabilistic implausibility character flaws philosophical issues false prophecies unreliable transmission childishness boringness incoherent structure cultural narrowness and ambiguity at this point its hard to imagine in principle what kind of flaw a text could have that this one doesnt and youre telling me this is the perfect word of god",
    "the potential incompatibility between above replacement birthrates and a core element of modern society before you start reading a short disclaimer this post is about a touchy topic that has unfortunately become a heated part of politics in many places i wrote the begining couple paragraphs in what might seem like an incendiary gotcha owned way but that really is not my intention and id like the reader to think about the topic with an open mind and look at it from the societal collapse risk pov the purpose of this post is to see what other people think about a subject that i feel is unpopular and politically charged enough that most people you talk to irl will just try to change topics or turn this discussion into stupid political namecalling also i start from a point where i assume most readers already understand why very subreplacement birthrates are just as unsustainable without collapse as very abovereplacement birthrates that said lets start since the begining of complex life on earth there has been a core law or concept lets call it ab though it is more of event a has a high chance of causing event b and event b cant be caused by anything other than even a which has stood just as true and deeply affected the way organisms have evolved as any law of physics through technology humans have been able to alter this law of our world and turn it into ab or that a happening doesnt necessarily have to lead to b happening this new ab has completely changed the way we plan and live our lives and has quickly become a core element of what is considered modern society nevertheless on every society where the technology that enabled this has become widely used and accepted birthrates have plummetted below replacement level on every single one of them not a single society has been able to come back to replacement birthrates or higher once ab happens and the ones that havent yet declined below the replacement rate are on their way there from reading this you might think well having changed a fundamental aspect of life that important was bound to cause effects like this duh yet thats not what most people seem to think or at least not what they say out loud whenever the topic of birthrate deline is brought up if you didnt catch on yet this is ofcourse about contraceptives now before you kill me i am not against contraceptives on a moral level nor am i some religious nutjob trying to tell you youll go to hell for using them because its written somewhere humans gaining the autonomy to better shape their life according to their personal philosophyreasoningwhatever through technology is obviously good and having kids when you dont wantcant have them obviously sucks for both the parent and the child however it stands true that by turning sexchildren into sexchildren we have completely destroyed a core facet of life that has conditioned human evolution and thus human biology since before humans even existed we evolved to have extremely strong urges for sex even though sex itself is irrelevant for the evolutionary process because sex was the mechanism through which descendants were produced and more sex increased the likelyhood that the progenitors genetic material would be passed down which would contain the genes for strong sexual urges etc basic evolution theory stuff on the other hand our instincts related to children themselves only really kick in during pregnancy iirc even the males paternity instincts get activated at that time through pheromones that pregnant women emmit since a strong urge for make children is not really needed when a strong urge for have sex already is a thing on sexchildren conditions people will say oh people are just more educated and want less kids or oh its cause the economy but both wealthy highly educated people and poor people from the past had many kids and no matter how rich or poor a modern country is all of them have gone below the replacement rate theres also the argument that oh its cause in agrarian societies children used to be crucial to help in farmwork but the early industrial and urban societies still had many kids before contraceptives most people no matter how much family planning they did ended up having a few more kids than they initially planned for and often at an earlier age than expected our impulse for sex is strong enough that it is able to override logic and make us act in extremelly weird ways especially during our biological sexual prime of our teens and early 20s where the parts of the brain that calculate risk and long term plansconsequences havent fully developed yet which is probably by design since a fully developed human brain at an earlier age might have had enough of an impact on the expected value of descendants for genes that lead for our sexual maturity to happen before brain maturity to become dominant in the collective human gene pool theres also the argument that modern society just has different expectations that push people less towards having kids it is true that societal expectations on children have changed greatly over time but those expectations have usually changed after contraceptives had already made sexchildren posible if anything i think societal expectations usually work in the oposite way that is once contraceptives are introduced it takes a couple decades until they are fully accepted for the full impact of sexchildren to start manifesting society changes slower than technology after all having read this i want you think about it for a couple minutes and answer the following do you think contraceptives can be compatible with a sustainable birthrate or do you think the change from sexchildren to sexchildren just goes against the conditions humans and life in general evolved on so much that it is just not posible as current trends and results from different policies cultures and socioeconomic levels seem to indicate because as sad as it makes me say it i feel the latter might be the case as nice as it is for humans to be able to have this choice it might just be a step too far the same way splitting the attom could result on the collapse of the modern world i think contraceptives might have the same potential though through less violent means obviously you could make humans breathe under water and it would still be less of a departure from our original environment than sexchildren since at least our ancestors from millions of years ago did breathe underwater but you have to go back to asexual reproduction when our single celled or very simple ancestors just cloned themselves for the last time that procreation was ruled by a law other than sexchildren in face of this what do you think humanity should do should we try to restrict contraceptive access to just extremecriminal cases kinda like some places do for abortions for the record i think abortions are obtrusive enough that they dont break sexchildren to nearly the same extent so i dont think they pose a collapse risk i think it would sadly be the less radical option with a chance of solving anything but current society is far away from being able to ponder this seriously without it being dragged down into the mud of politics should we just keep using contraceptives as now and see what happens seems like for now this is the most likely option but to me it seems crazy for the answer to what might be the most puzzling issue humans will ever face to end up being basically jesus take the wheel or maybe should we go one step further or in a sense closer depends how far back you go from the original humans and start mainly reproducing asexually through cloninggenetic engineeringlab babieswhatever it might seem crazy at the moment but breaking sexchildren is just as much a diversion from our original environment as that the main issue i see with this option is that for it to increase the birth rate parents in the traditional sense have to stop being a thing as the ammount of children that people want will not have changed and they would still have the ability to choose it would have to work something like the government creating 1 kid per person and assigning them as your mandatory child that you have to raise like it or not regardless of whether you even have a partner or the government raising them on care facilities staffed by childcare professionals either way it is a dystopian as fuck solution but given enough technology and desperation i bet at least one authoritarian state is going to try this out at some point so at least from what ive been able to come up with the answers would be either some government mandated reproduction control or changing nothing and hoping for the best even when all the examples seem to corroborate that our biology might just not be capable of resulting in sustainable birthrates without sexchildren and just try to rawdog the collapse it might cause funnily enough if the modern industrial world collapses hard enough we might just not have access to mass produced contraceptives anymore and go back to early industrial birthrates lol either way its not looking good fam in any case thank you if you managed to get through this faily lengthy and scatterbrained post of mine and i hope it sparked some thoughts on the topic or at least served as a bit of a distraction from the ai and climate related collapse posts pd i flaired the post as history cause there is no population decline flair even though there is one for overpopulation and both are potential causes of a collapse and if anything decline is more likely to cause one in todays world because of every system having been made with growth in mind",
    "exploding the canon starring the gospel of peter and therere maps and heaven at the end most people dont know that diocletian divided up the roman empire into 4 sections with himself as ultimate authority a coemperor and 2 caesars then he chose syrian antioch as his first residence peter had been the first bishop of antioch he was surrounded by christians or galileans as they were referred to contemptuously by the romans and the jews in fact then diocletian moved his center to nicomedia and landed himself in christianity central this is the apostolic era these christians were serious people who barely cared about rome or their gods in 303 ad diocletian declared the extermination of christianity there is no copy of the decree but many references to it the salient point in this post is that all christian writings were to be burned any who had them and knew about the decree were to be burned along with them 303ad 1 in this year imperial orders were given that the christian churches were to be destroyed the sacred books be burnt and the clergy and all christians be handed over for torture and be compelled to sacrifice to idols this was the most terrifying persecution of all producing countless martyrs aramaic chronicle of theophanes the confessor diocletian 19th year am 5795 ad 30231 im probably going to leave other refs at the end but this was a horrifying persecution diocletian went to war led troops entered homes and searched forced people to swear allegiance to roman gods his problem was maximian didnt care there was little christian influence in the east look up at the maps and he pretty much ignored it galerius continued with antichristian policies but he didnt look for anything unless it was shoved in his face many things happened because of this but one of them was the christian writings were hidden buried in the sand in jars and caves unless someone gave them up there was no way to identify a persian christian no crosses around necks no icons on walls we know that the gospel of thomas and the gospel of peter existed at this time and were used in the east because they are mentioned by origen and others now in 306 constantines father constantius caesar of the far north east died and his army declared his son constantine caesar this was the common way emperors and caesars got made then constantine kicked the other three guys butts took over the whole empire and in an unprecedented move allowed diocletian to retire instead of die dont panic i will not try to do some history of the establishment of the canon the point here is that a lot of scripture of the first 3 centuries of christianity was lost only to be found centuries later squirreled away in monasteries and buried in sand in dry climates of the east this is about the gospel of peter and why no one in the 4th century and never in later centuries would anyone call it canon im just going to quote it where it differs from what were familiar with mr jamestranslation and notes oxford clarendon press 1924 fragment i i 1 but of the jews no man washed his hands neither did herod nor any one of his judges and whereas they would not 2 wash pilate rose up and then herod the king commanded that the lord should be taken into their hands saying unto them all that i commanded you to do unto him do ye ii 3 now there stood there joseph the friend of pilate and of the lord and he knowing that they were about to crucify him came unto pilate and begged the body of jesus for burial and pilate sending unto herod begged his body 5 and herod said brother pilate even if none had begged for him we should have buried him since also the sabbath dawneth for it is written in the law that the sun should not set upon one that hath been slain murdered skipping to golgotha bypassing purple robes and such iv 10 and they brought two malefactors and crucified the 11 lord between them but he kept silence as one feeling no pain and when they set the cross upright they wrote 12 thereon this is the king of israel and they laid his garments before him and divided them among themselves and 13 cast the lot upon them but one of those malefactors reproached them saying we have thus suffered for the evils which we have done but this man which hath become the 14 saviour of men wherein hath he injured you and they were wroth with him and commanded that his legs should not be broken that so he might die in torment v 15 now it was noonday and darkness prevailed over all judaea and they were troubled and in an agony lest the sun should have set for that he yet lived for it is written for them that the sun should not set upon him that hath been 16 slain murdered and one of them said give ye him to drink gall with vinegar and they mingled it and gave him 17 to drink and they fulfilled all things and accomplished 18 their sins upon their own heads and many went about with 19 lamps supposing that it was night and some fell and the lord cried out aloud saying my power my power thou hast forsaken me and when he had so said he was taken up viii 28 but the scribes and pharisees and elders gathered one with another for they had heard that all the people were murmuring and beating their breasts saying if these very great signs have come to pass at his death behold how 29 righteous he was and the elders were afraid and came unto 30 pilate entreating him and saying give us soldiers that we or they may watch his sepulchre for three days lest his disciples come and steal him away and the people suppose 31 that he is risen from the dead and do us hurt and pilate gave them petronius the centurion with soldiers to watch the sepulchre and the elders and scribes came with them unto 32 the tomb and when they had rolled a great stone to keep out al together with the centurion and the soldiers then all 33 that were there together set it upon the door of the tomb and plastered thereon seven seals and they pitched a tent there and kept watch ix 34 and early in the morning as the sabbath dawned there came a multitude from jerusalem and the region roundabout to see the sepulchre that had been sealed 35 now in the night whereon the lords day dawned as the soldiers were keeping guard two by two in every watch 36 there came a great sound in the heaven and they saw the heavens opened and two men descend thence shining with lit having a great light and drawing near unto the sepulchre 37 and that stone which had been set on the door rolled away of itself and went back to the side and the sepulchre was x 38 opened and both of the young men entered in when therefore those soldiers saw that they waked up the centurion and the elders for they also were there keeping 39 watch and while they were yet telling them the things which they had seen they saw again three men come out of the sepulchre and two of them sustaining the other lit the 40 one and a cross following after them and of the two they saw that their heads reached unto heaven but of him that 41 was led by them that it overpassed the heavens and they 42 heard a voice out of the heavens saying hast thou or thou hast preached unto them that sleep and an answer was heard from the cross saying yea xv 58 now it was the last day of unleavened bread and many were coming forth of the city and returning unto their 59 own homes because the feast was at an end but we the twelve disciples of the lord were weeping and were in sorrow and each one being grieved for that which had befallen 60 departed unto his own house but i simon peter and andrew my brother took our nets and went unto the sea and there was with us levi the son of alphaeus whom the lord for fragment ii see apocalypse of peter below is what the scholar said in 1924 note that until very recently any document like this that was found and had close relationships to the set canon texts was believed to have copied from the canonical gospels dating later than the gospels was based on that assumption especially when the document diverges from accepted beliefs or dogmas contemporary scholars have generally not followed this trend or these assumptions the present fragment was discovered in 1884 in a tomb at akhmimin egypt the manuscript in which it is a little book containing a portion of the book of enoch in greek this fragment on the passion and another a description of heaven and hell which is either as i now think a second fragment of the gospel or a piece of the apocalypse of peter it will be given later under that head we have seen that the gospel of peter is quoted by writers of the latter end of the second century it has been contended that justin martyr also used it soon after the middle of that century but the evidence is not demonstrative i believe it is not safe to date the book much earlier than a d 150 it uses all four canonical gospels and is the earliest uncanonical account of the passion that exists it is not wholly orthodox for it throws doubt on the reality of the lords sufferings and by consequence upon the reality of his human body in other words it is as serapion of antioch indicated of a docetic character another characteristic of it is its extremely antijewish attitude blame is thrown on the jews wherever possible and pilate is whitewashed why is this dangerous the whole of the monumental structure of atonement theories of the crucifixion collapses if jesus did not suffer on the cross interestingly of all that was described in the canonical versions no one ever describes jesus crying out in pain moaning weeping writhing or indicating in any way his specific experience of suffering they ignored it by itself its enough to repress this document we hardly needed diocletian the presumption by serapion in 200ad and this scholar in 1924 is that if jesus didnt suffer he wasnt truly human he was a spirit possibly with a body of some kind of celestial material docetism because jesus can heal a leper and feed thousands with a few fish but the love of god wouldnt spare him the pain when jesus asks to be spared the cup he doesnt mean dying he means suffering the pain it seems to me but there is a great power in his final surrender of human fear to gods will god said yes we dont need to change the true human we need to acknowledge the true god theres no mention of jesus saying anything except that his power left him he was aware of the process of being taken up but he doesnt pray for the soldiers who decided to torture even more the malefactor who dared criticize them jesus doesnt bother to offer to take him to paradise but the scholar is also upset because the story of the crucifixion seems anti jewish during the diocletian persecution the one kind of christian who was bypassed besides having no writings in his possession what one who was circumcised the jews had no love for the galileans before jesus they had a lot less now with the east being fairly safe jews fled to rome and established 2nd temple christianity and the ot the only books it was always safe to read became as prominent as the nt writings that were still being argued over the point finally is this the approved books we call the canon of scripture if you delve into it was not only a political choice it is rife with rewrites and truncated quotes from writings discovered centuries later that are preserved by everyone in their original form nobody is rewriting the gospel of thomas and you cant use it because it totally justifies something like a trans persons literal steps to transitioning my job is to preach the gospel i dont do it that much but want to and will but im staring with the oldest writings we have including the later found documents and mark and the part of john that came from the apocalypse of peter its really good the holy spirit did protect all these writings for a couple thousand years because they have nothing to tell us here also is the word of the lord youll like this 4 and the lord added and said let us go unto the mountain and pray 5 and going with him we the twelve disciples besought him that he would show us one of our righteous brethren that had departed out of the world that we might see what manner of men they are in their form and take courage and encourage also the men that should hear us 6 and as we prayed suddenly there appeared two men standing before the lord perhaps add to the east upon whom we were not able to look 7 for there issued from their countenance a ray as of the sun and their raiment was shining so as the eye of man never saw the like for no mouth is able to declare nor heart to conceive the glory wherewith they were clad and the beauty of their countenance 8 whom when we saw we were astonished for their bodies were whiter than any snow and redder than any rose 9 and the redness of them was mingled with the whiteness and in a word i am not able to declare their beauty 10 for their hair was curling and flourishing flowery and fell comely about their countenance and their shoulders like a garland woven of nard and various flowers or like a rainbow in the air such was their comeliness 11 we then seeing the beauty of them were astonished at them for they appeared suddenly 12 and i drew near to the lord and said who are these 13 he saith to me these are your our righteous brethren whose appearance ye did desire to see 14 and i said unto him and where are all the righteous or of what sort is the world wherein they are and possess this glory 15 and the lord showed me a very great region outside this world exceeding bright with light and the air of that place illuminated with the beams of the sun and the earth of itself flowering with blossoms that fade not and full of spices and plants fairflowering and incorruptible and bearing blessed fruit 16 and so great was the blossom that the odour thereof was borne thence even unto us not a moses or elijah in sight where did the writer of revelations get the idea for the seven seals 2 this was the nineteenth year of the reign of diocletian the month dystrus which would be called march among the romans in which as the festival of the saviours passion was approaching an imperial letter was promulgated everywhere ordering the churches to be razed to their foundations and the scriptures to be put out of existence by fire and proclaiming that those who held positions of honor be disenfranchized and that household servants if they clung to the profession of christianity be deprived of their freedom the first written pronouncement against us was of such a nature but not long afterwards as other letters continued to circulate he ordered that all the bishops of the churches in every place be first committed to prison then later be forced by every device to offer sacrifice then truly then very many of those in control of the churches eagerly contended with terrible torments and exhibited examples of mighty conflicts eusebius history ecclesiastical 823 an edict of diocletian on february 23 303 to promote religious uniformity this edict which remained in effect until 313 led to the persecution of the church and called for the burning of its sacred writings diocletian also compelled christians to turn over their sacred books to the authorities to be burned in the words of eusebius we saw with our very eyes the inspired and sacred scriptures committed to the flames in the marketplaces in response to the imperial letter ordering the destruction by fire of the scriptures hist eccl 82l and 4 athanasius the bishop of alexandria being the first to use it for the authoritative list of biblical books in a letter in 367 ce refs saved ancient writers who referred to the gospel of peter include origen and eusebius in the 3rd and 4th centuries and serapion of antioch in the late 2nd century serapion initially endorsed the gospel but later condemned its docetic heresy after finding a copy while origen mentioned it in connection with other apocryphal writings and eusebius discussed it in his church history as a noncanonical text serapion of antioch in the late 2nd century serapion encountered a community using the gospel of peter and initially authorized its use after reading it himself he found heretical additions to the text and later advised against its use origen the 3rdcentury writer origen was the first to mention a gospel attributed to peter he references a gospel according to peter in his writings but its not clear if he had read the extant text as he also mentions a book of james in the same passage eusebius in the 4th century eusebius known as the father of church history twice mentions the gospel of peter in his church history he lists it among the noncanonical texts and devotes a section to discussing why it was excluded from the canon the gospel of peter the first known reference to a gospel attributed to peter occurs in a secondcentury letter written by serapion bishop of antioch in this letter serapion responds to questions from christians in rhossus about a gospel by peter without knowing much about the text serapion initially affirmed the gospels authority because of its ties to one of the apostles later after finding out that the text was used by docetists a rival group who believed that christ was pure spirit not a human named jesus and that therefore christ did not suffer serapion decided that he would no longer encourage christians to read the text so he didnt exactly find heretical additions by reading the text he just what heard a heretical sect was using it to justify their beliefs of course carpocrates used marks gospel to justify their beliefs but no one thought we shouldnt read it whats the difference the apocalypse of peter the muratorian fragment with canon for dating athens not alexandria yes people have gone to athens to study greek philosophers with historical figures like the roman orator cicero traveling there for philosophical and rhetorical training and many others studying at institutions like platos academy and aristotles lyceum ancient greek students as well as foreign visitors during the roman era would go to athens to learn from and debate with the famous thinkers who taught at these philosophical schools which were central to the citys intellectual life why people studied in athens to learn from the masters students like aristotle who studied under plato went to athens to be taught by the most influential philosophers of their time to engage with new ideas athens was a center for intellectual discourse attracting people who wanted to be part of the philosophical discussions that took place in schools like the academy and the lyceum to get a wellrounded education beyond philosophy trips to athens were also pursued for training in rhetoric and other subjects and to socialize with other students for cultural and historical reasons in modern times people visit athens to see the sites where these philosophers lived and taught and to study the rich history and literature of greece famous athenian philosophical schools platos academy founded around 387387 387 bc this school was a major center for philosophical learning for centuries aristotles lyceum founded by aristotle in 335335 335 bc the lyceum was a school where students engaged in both philosophical and scientific research the stoa poikile painted porch this was a public

    "stormont and belfast city council in standoff over who clears leaves a standoff has emerged between stormont and belfast city council over who clears up the leaves in the city council officers are stating that fallen leaves do not count as litter under legislation and therefore the council is not legally obliged to clear them under waste disposal while the stormont department for infrastructure is saying the opposite a council committee which met at city hall this week backed a proposal by sdlp councillor gary mckeown on leaf clearance from roads and pavements the committee agreed to find out and if required get legal advice on who exactly has legal responsibility for the clearing of leaves from streets and pavements in the city during the monthly people and communities committee meeting on tuesday november 4 councillor mckeown said there appears to be a standoff between the stormont department for infrastructure and the council over whose responsibility it is to clear leaves from pavements and roads in the city this comes round every year in the autumn and no doubt many members around this table receive correspondence from residents about the fact that their drains are absolutely choked with leaves and are requesting something be done about it the flood levels seen over the past week has brought this into particularly sharp focus given the impact it has had on communities the councils position is that it has no legal duty to clear leaf fall he said dfis position officially is that street sweeping including the clearing of leaves falls under the councils responsibility as part of their remit for the collection of waste and the removal of litter but the councils position is that it has no legal duty to clear leaf fall but cleansing staff do their best to remove any buildup on the pavements as part of their work where and when possible both of these positions cant be true because they are in direct competition with each other in terms of where that responsibility lies and so the issue is then where does that put residents and businesses who are dealing with this yearin yearout and in extreme circumstances suffer an extreme impact as a result is it appropriate that people are outside their homes and premises desperately poking at drains to get them cleared before flood water rises and enters those premises it is happening quite regularly and we know that more severe weather events are going to occur due to climate change so it is more important than ever that we get on top of this he added it also doesnt help that dfi stated commitment to clear gullies appears somewhat ambiguous because i know a number of locations that have been reported over a long period of time remain uncleared and we see that every time there is heavy rain those roads fill with water at the locations of those blocked drains in addition of course there is the issue of leaves on pavements and roads presenting a risk of injury from people slipping this needs to be brought to a head we skirt around it every year but we never seem to get a determined resolution about what is going to be done and where the responsibilities lie he said i do want to acknowledge the great work our teams do on the ground to clear leaves every year particularly at hot spots this is very much appreciated i know it is no small effort is required to do it particularly around south belfast but that is not sustainable our staff are already under pressure particularly in areas with ongoing issues with flytipping and littering we cannot just leave it to good luck and availability of staff to cover this ultimately we need to get absolute clarity on who is responsible for lifting leaves on pavements and roads and from that adequate resources must be put in place to deliver this rather than being managed on an ad hoc basis which seems to be the case at the minute then people can know what kind of service to expect so those who are responsible can be held to account if it isnt delivered he added we cant have two government agencies at odds with each other it isnt sustainable street sweeping including the clearing of leaves falls under councils responsibility a council officer said at the meeting i was not aware that dfi was at odds with us until this occurred it is unfortunate there was a press release that went out on the dfi website saying it was our responsibility we have done excellent work in relation to this with them and we work quite closely with them on a range of issues across the city we have a dedicated leaffall programme that we put in place for 12 weeks every year and we try to focus on the areas where we know the leaves will accumulate but it is not our legal responsibility to do this we are very clear on that we will go back to legal services and we will seek clarification on that we have been told that fallen leaves do not fall into the definition of the litter order and so it is not our responsibility to lift them it means the responsibility is with dfi who have specific powers in relation to cleaning drains under the roads act the department for infrastructure spokesperson said during last weeks floods in belfast street sweeping including the clearing of leaves falls under councils responsibility as part of their remit for the collection of waste and removal of litter they added that dfi aims to inspect and clean gullies once annually and also provides further adhoc cleaning within available budgets to address and specific localised issues or deal with severe weather

    "resistance normal aar year 7 see initial post here main post see previous year here year 6 another year in preparation against the aliens my friends this time weve gotten to see the flourishing of the mercurial flower within the heat of the sun and our space economy is truly online now first things first i noticed something interesting before even beginning yor forger has so many orgs giving so many extra missions that i actually have to scroll to see them all of course early on we got started with some annoyance missions just look at her does basically nothing but run around and poke the bears but shes a beauty i got a question from magniciv about the mars bases so heres the list while the protectorate did get the chance to spend more mc on this i got a fair few useful mining sites im already getting the marine assault unit project completed so i can look at taking over some of what they have there now ive noticed that the protectorate owns quite a bit of the space assets id like to take at present theyre my largest rival in space however i think i can clean them out in one fell sweep the protectorate owns most of the eu which has been growing id bet that if they lost that close to 27 mc theyre getting it would make it really hard for them to keep maintaining a space presence therefore ive sent danny motta to start making the eu love me once ive got the popularity it will be time to raise the unrest and coup also this i just control niger now i didnt ask for it and i dont really want it so im just going to abandon it now theres good news and bad news in the latter half of the year the good news my operations centers have finished bringing me up to 95 mc cap and im only using 50 right now the bad news i overestimated my income a little when building all those and the first batch of nanofactories wont be done for another month so hopefully i can weather that out without going broke and hopefully the batch of nanofactories will make enough to offset this however with the mc taken care of by operations centers now ive went ahead and modified the usa priorities primarily want to increase knowledge but also keeping the economy growing and starting to improve the military think i might also add some environment in there to slow down the negative effects of climate change now since weve been discussing taking over habs i went ahead and designed a new class of ship the bam and scram class gunship its purpose is to move through space quickly drop off marines and leave as were getting into the final months of the year the aliens show their true colors to the world truly a dark day to help combat this threat though really more for against other human factions the all new ss boots on the ground is here to brings habs under my control almost immediately its time to test out the ss boots on the ground lets see if this works it worked then after another handful of days ive captured every single protectorate station in leo1 allowing me to finally reach 8 separate stations in leo orbit for me to throw the different research centers onto unfortunately it does put me just over my mc cap so ill have to wait to go capture all the martian sites until more operations centers get built to finish out the year just had to get one more annoyance mission in there thus we end out the year also welcome to 2030 its a new decade not a decade from when we started but a new decade nonetheless look at us we have plenty of mc and are using it for a bunch of stations and habs ive been grabbing orgs for mining output left and right im at a 54 bonus at this point i grabbed every single site on mercury and am converting them all into operations center bases speaking of which im nearly bankrupt from running it all unfortunately most of my nanofactories wont be done until the middle of the year so im probably going to have to live with being bankrupt for a while until it all finally comes online ive also built a number of ship oriented stations for mercury earth and mars i built a station in extreme orbit with shipyards 24 depending on the planet as well as a station in low orbit with a supply depot on earth its actually a space dock since that was the original ship builder this should allow me to construct ships that i need on any of my main planets and supply them when they have to deal with aliens attacking that location the ss boots on the ground has been really good for getting me all the stations ill be using for research im also planning on building a second one around mars to grab those habs once ive got some more mc building it there is going to be faster than sending the existing one to mars ive researched nearly all of the projects i need to design a defensive ship at this point i just need to get adamantine im presently researching the last global tech for it and then ill design it in that vein im also now controlling 2 global techs at all times though i am thinking about releasing one for some time to let me focus on finishing projects faster my plan for next year is to get a design done for a defensive ship and start amassing fleets of them at my three planets im still working off the design of using 40mm autocannons for the weapons and just running at the enemy to spray them down after i build some well see how feasible that tactic is i do also have the salvage bay unlocked so ill be including that in the design ill also be focusing on disrupting the eu control the protectorate have i dont currently have the mc to control the eu entirely but i can at least force the protectorate out of it let me know any suggestions or advice you have thanks yall",

    "the new rules of the wine list smaller quirkier and more profitable the new rules of the wine list smaller quirkier and more profitable i ran a fine dining wine program for years we had 400 titles 3600 bottles we won awards most of that wine collected dust that inventory was dead money sitting in the cellar the economy killed the old model fine dining restaurant sales dropped 13 in early 20241 guests had less money to spend the united states wine market volume fell 5 in 20242 this year looks flat at best somewhere between 0 and 1 growth 2 people stopped buying expensive bottles they stopped buying wine at all smart restaurants adapted they cut wine lists from 400 titles down to 60 80 or 1003 they mixed brands people trust with quirky wines from places guests never heard of they trained staff to sell every bottle they priced aggressively on the unknowns they turned wine from a status symbol into a profit center the shift worked smaller lists generate higher margins inventory turns over four to eight times per month instead of once per quarter4 staff sell wine with confidence instead of confusion guests order more because they feel less intimidated this is what happens when you stop chasing awards and start chasing profit why the old model died consumer confidence hit bottom starting in 2024 and continues today guests changed what they buy and how much they spend tips dropped from 1517 in the first quarter to 1499 in the second quarter of 20251 that adds up fast across hundreds of transactions guests still want wine but they pick wines they recognize or wines that look like good value5 they skip the expensive they avoid wine lists that make them feel stupid restaurant wine lists got shorter because intimidated guests dont buy wine6 wine distributors changed too sales reps got spread thinner to cover more accounts5 distributors moved wine selection online where buyers research without sales pressure5 wine buyers gained freedom to build lists based on what actually sells instead of what the rep pushed restaurants responded by getting ruthless they stopped pretending big wine lists impress guests they built programs that turn inventory fast and make profit3 they cut storage costs they simplified staff training they focused on wines that move how small lists win start with brands people know guests want reliability when they spend money they trust prosecco malbec from argentina chardonnay from california prosecco accounts for 31 of italian wine sales in the united states7 prosecco pdo exports reached 527 million in just the first four months of 2025 up 15 year over year8 that is 76 of all italian sparkling wine exports 8 guests recognize prosecco they order it you get consistent sales dont stop there mix in quirky wines from places guests never heard of italian wines like falanghina and pecorino from small regions argentine malbec from family vineyards washington state syrah from tiny producers 90 of washington state wineries produce fewer than 5000 cases per year9 these are small producers making serious wine with sustainability focus9 over 80 different grape varieties grow in washington 9 guests never heard of most of them that gives you pricing freedom here is the math guests know that a bottle of kendalljackson chardonnay costs between 15 and 50 at the grocery store they notice if you charge 80 for a 20 bottle10 they dont know what a falanghina from campania costs outside your restaurant you set margins higher on the unknowns because guests judge them on taste and story not retail comparison10 the blend matters you stock enough recognizable wines to build trust you stock enough strange wines to build margin together they create velocity bottles sell inventory turns profit appears the math behind smaller lists wine by the glass programs drive profit the gross margin on glass pours runs 75 to 80 which means your pour cost stays at 20 to 2511 the standard rule is charge the wholesale bottle price for one glass12 a bottle that costs you 20 wholesale gets poured at 20 per glass a standard bottle holds 25 ounces a standard pour runs 5 ounces that gives you five glasses per bottle at 20 each for 100 in revenue13 your cost was 20 your gross profit is 80 thats an 80 gross margin11 restaurants set bottle prices higher for wines they offer by the glass around 122 higher than similar wines sold only by the bottle14 that compensates for waste and spoilage from opened bottles14 blended wine costs for wellmanaged programs run 31 to 35 when you mix glass pours and bottle sales15 wine sales for upscale fine dining venues account for approximately 25 to 30 of overall sales16 a smaller list lets you feature more wines by the glass because you turn inventory faster less waste better profit inventory turnover matters the average restaurant inventory turnover ratio falls around 5 meaning you sell out your entire inventory five times in a given period17 healthy restaurant inventory turns over four to eight times per month4 wine typically turns over once per month18 a small focused wine list with highdemand bottles can turn over faster than that3 faster turnover means less cash tied up and less spoilage wine spoilage accounts for up to 8 of inventory19 storage costs drop with smaller lists a small wine cellar for 500 bottles costs 15000 to 30000 to build20 a midsize cellar for 500 to 1500 bottles costs 30000 to 6000020 thats capital you dont tie up restaurants with 80 titles and 400 bottles store everything in a backofhouse area3 restaurants with 400 titles and thousands of bottles need significant cellar space 3 labor costs drop too training staff on 400 wines is impossible nobody remembers that much training staff on 60 wines is doable3 your servers taste every bottle they learn flavor profiles food pairings winery stories and one fun fact about each bottle21 then they sell with confidence train your team on every bottle your wine list only works if your team sells it small lists make training simple hold weekly tastings where servers try three or four wines 21 give them tasting sheets to jot down notes compare impressions as a group highlight food pairings from your menu repeat the winery story and fun facts 21 teach basic vocabulary oaky crisp fruitforward earthy teach pairing principles like acidity cuts through rich dishes 21 teach interaction skills like asking whether guests prefer lighter or fullerbodied wines 21 teach storytelling like familyowned vineyards or unique aging processes 21 these basics let servers connect with guests and recommend confidently create simple reference guides laminated sheets with key attributes for each wine grape varieties region flavor notes price 21 keep them behind the bar for quick review servers brush up during downtime run roleplaying exercises 21 set up scenarios where servers practice recommending wines to each other a guest feels uncertain a guest wants bold reds a couple wants something special for an anniversary 21 staff practice their approach and get feedback celebrate small wins incentivize learning 21 run friendly competitions reward servers who recommend the most different varieties in a month offer small bonuses for upselling featured wines recognize achievements at preshift meetings staff who taste the wines and know the stories sell more wine3 they build guest trust they upsell confidently they turn wine into a profit center instead of an afterthought price quirky wines for margin pricing strategy separates profitable wine programs from mediocre ones guests know what they pay at grocery stores for major brands10 they notice if you charge too much but guests dont know what unknown gems cost10 that gives you pricing freedom most restaurants use a progressive markup the industry standard is to mark up a bottle of wine 200 to 300 over its retail sales price22 a 10 wholesale wine sells for 30 a 50 wholesale wine sells for 80 thats a 3x markup on the cheap wine and a 16x markup on the expensive wine the model balances affordability on highend bottles with profit on entrylevel wines quirky wines from italy argentina and washington state give you margin10 guests trust your recommendation they try something new they pay your price because they dont know the retail cost 10 you pair that with fair pricing on major brands to build trust that mix maximizes profit without gouging guests three restaurants that prove it works dunsmoor in los angeles keeps about 60 bottles at any given time23 wine director rachael davis rotates the list constantly and seasonally 23 most bottles list under 200 the list features neoclassics and postmodern wines mostly from europe with strong support from top american producers 23 the compact list stays approachable staff training stays simple inventory management stays tight guests order wine because they dont feel overwhelmed 23 borgo in new york focuses on lowintervention wines from france portugal spain and italy24 wine director lee campbell built a smaller yet impeccably curated core list 24 borgo features 15 wines by the glass at all times rotated regularly 24 the bytheglass program drives traffic to the bar guests try wines without committing to a bottle some of those guests buy bottles later because they liked what they tasted 24 the model works because it builds trust through smaller commitments first ambrogio15 in san diego curates a selection of biodynamic and natural wines from smallscale italian makers25 the list stays sophisticated yet reasonably priced that approach works because it solves two problems at once guests feel like they found something special and they dont get gouged on price25 that drives loyalty and repeat sales these three restaurants prove the same point small wine lists drive higher profits they create faster inventory turns they empower staff to sell confidently guests feel smarter everybody wins the space and labor you save big wine cellars cost real money a small wine cellar for 500 bottles costs 15000 to 30000 to build20 a midsize cellar for 500 to 1500 bottles costs 30000 to 60000 20 a large cellar for 1500 or more bottles runs 60000 to over 10000020 thats capital you dont have in restaurants right now you also avoid hidden costs of managing a large inventory someone tracks 400 wines across multiple vintages someone updates the list when wines sell out someone reorders and restocks someone handles breakage and spoilage19 all of that takes time a small list with 60 to 80 wines cuts that workload by 803 your wine program becomes manageable instead of overwhelming the space you save goes to guests you add tables you expand the bar you create a better dining experience the money you save on construction storage and labor goes to payroll food costs and everything else that matters what this means for your restaurant you dont need 400 wine titles you need 60 to 100 titles that sell you stock brands guests trust you stock quirky wines that give you pricing power you train your team on every bottle you price fairly on major brands and aggressively on unknowns you turn over inventory four to eight times per month that strategy cuts costs you spend less on storage and climate control you tie up less cash in inventory you reduce spoilage and waste you simplify staff training it increases profit too wine by the glass programs hit 75 to 80 gross margins11 restaurants set bottle prices 122 higher for wines offered by the glass14 upscale dining wine sales run 25 to 30 of total revenue16 staff who know every wine on a small list upsell better guests order more wine because they feel less intimidated the economy isnt going to improve quickly consumer spending is staying tight wine consumption stays flat or negative guests want value or brands they trust restaurants that adapt win restaurants that cling to giant wine lists because they always did it that way lose cut your wine list stock wines that sell train your team cold

    "presentday climate change includes both global warmingthe ongoing increase in global average temperatureand its wider effects on earths climate system climate change in a broader sense also includes previous longterm changes to earths climate the current rise in global temperatures is driven by human activities especially fossil fuel coal oil and natural gas burning since the industrial revolution fossil fuel use deforestation and some agricultural and industrial practices release greenhouse gases these gases absorb some of the heat that the earth radiates after it warms from sunlight warming the lower atmosphere carbon dioxide the primary gas driving global warming has increased in concentration by about 50 since the preindustrial era to levels not seen for millions of years climate change has an increasingly large impact on the environment deserts are expanding while heat waves and wildfires are becoming more common amplified warming in the arctic has contributed to thawing permafrost retreat of glaciers and sea ice decline higher temperatures are also causing more intense storms droughts and other weather extremes rapid environmental change in mountains coral reefs and the arctic is forcing many species to relocate or become extinct even if efforts to minimize future warming are successful some effects will continue for centuries these include ocean heating ocean acidification and sea level rise climate change threatens people with increased flooding extreme heat increased food and water scarcity more disease and economic loss human migration and conflict can also be a result the world health organization calls climate change one of the biggest threats to global health in the 21st century societies and ecosystems will experience more severe risks without action to limit warming adapting to climate change through efforts like flood control measures or droughtresistant crops partially reduces climate change risks although some limits to adaptation have already been reached poorer communities are responsible for a small share of global emissions yet have the least ability to adapt and are most vulnerable to climate change many climate change impacts have been observed in the first decades of the 21st century with 2024 the warmest on record at 160 c 288 f since regular tracking began in 1850 additional warming will increase these impacts and can trigger tipping points such as melting all of the greenland ice sheet under the 2015 paris agreement nations collectively agreed to keep warming well under 2 c however with pledges made under the agreement global warming would still reach about 28 c 50 f by the end of the century there is widespread support for climate action worldwide and most countries aim to stop emitting carbon dioxide fossil fuels can be phased out by stopping subsidising them conserving energy and switching to energy sources that do not produce significant carbon pollution these energy sources include wind solar hydro and nuclear power cleanly generated electricity can replace fossil fuels for powering transportation heating buildings and running industrial processes carbon can also be removed from the atmosphere for instance by increasing forest cover and farming with methods that store carbon in soil terminology before the 1980s it was unclear whether the warming effect of increased greenhouse gases was stronger than the cooling effect of airborne particulates in air pollution scientists used the term inadvertent climate modification to refer to human impacts on the climate at this time in the 1980s the terms global warming and climate change became more common often being used interchangeably scientifically global warming refers only to increased global average surface temperature while climate change describes both global warming and its effects on earths climate system such as precipitation changes climate change can also be used more broadly to include changes to the climate that have happened throughout earths history global warmingused as early as 1975became the more popular term after nasa climate scientist james hansen used it in his 1988 testimony in the us senate since the 2000s usage of climate change has increased various scientists politicians and media may use the terms climate crisis or climate emergency to talk about climate change and may use the term global heating instead of global warming global temperature rise temperatures prior to presentday global warming over the last few million years the climate cycled through ice ages one of the hotter periods was the last interglacial around 125000 years ago where temperatures were between 05 c and 15 c warmer than before the start of global warming this period saw sea levels 5 to 10 metres higher than today the most recent glacial maximum 20000 years ago was some 57 c colder this period has sea levels that were over 125 metres 410 ft lower than today temperatures stabilized in the current interglacial period beginning 11700 years ago this period also saw the start of agriculture historical patterns of warming and cooling like the medieval warm period and the little ice age did not occur at the same time across different regions temperatures may have reached as high as those of the late 20th century in a limited set of regions climate information for that period comes from climate proxies such as trees and ice cores warming since the industrial revolution around 1850 thermometer records began to provide global coverage between the 18th century and 1970 there was little net warming as the warming impact of greenhouse gas emissions was offset by cooling from sulfur dioxide emissions sulfur dioxide causes acid rain but it also produces sulfate aerosols in the atmosphere which reflect sunlight and cause global dimming after 1970 the increasing accumulation of greenhouse gases and controls on sulfur pollution led to a marked increase in temperature ongoing changes in climate have had no precedent for several thousand years multiple datasets all show worldwide increases in surface temperature at a rate of around 02 c per decade the 20142023 decade warmed to an average 119 c 106130 c compared to the preindustrial baseline 18501900 not every single year was warmer than the last internal climate variability processes can make any year 02 c warmer or colder than the average from 1998 to 2013 negative phases of two such processes pacific decadal oscillation pdo and atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo caused a short slower period of warming called the global warming hiatus after the hiatus the opposite occurred with 2024 well above the recent average at more than 15 c this is why the temperature change is defined in terms of a 20year average which reduces the noise of hot and cold years and decadal climate patterns and detects the longterm signal a wide range of other observations reinforce the evidence of warming the upper atmosphere is cooling because greenhouse gases are trapping heat near the earths surface and so less heat is radiating into space warming reduces average snow cover and forces the retreat of glaciers at the same time warming also causes greater evaporation from the oceans leading to more atmospheric humidity more and heavier precipitation plants are flowering earlier in spring and thousands of animal species have been permanently moving to cooler areas differences by region different regions of the world warm at different rates the pattern is independent of where greenhouse gases are emitted because the gases persist long enough to diffuse across the planet since the preindustrial period the average surface temperature over land regions has increased almost twice as fast as the global average surface temperature this is because oceans lose more heat by evaporation and oceans can store a lot of heat the thermal energy in the global climate system has grown with only brief pauses since at least 1970 and over 90 of this extra energy has been stored in the ocean the rest has heated the atmosphere melted ice and warmed the continents the northern hemisphere and the north pole have warmed much faster than the south pole and southern hemisphere the northern hemisphere not only has much more land but also more seasonal snow cover and sea ice as these surfaces flip from reflecting a lot of light to being dark after the ice has melted they start absorbing more heat local black carbon deposits on snow and ice also contribute to arctic warming arctic surface temperatures are increasing between three and four times faster than in the rest of the world melting of ice sheets near the poles weakens both the atlantic and the antarctic limb of thermohaline circulation which further changes the distribution of heat and precipitation around the globe future global temperatures the world meteorological organization estimates there is almost a 50 chance of the fiveyear average global temperature exceeding 15 c between 2024 and 2028 the ipcc expects the 20year average to exceed 15 c in the early 2030s the ipcc sixth assessment report 2021 included projections that by 2100 global warming is very likely to reach 1018 c under a scenario with very low emissions of greenhouse gases 2135 c under an intermediate emissions scenario or 3357 c under a very high emissions scenario the warming will continue past 2100 in the intermediate and high emission scenarios with future projections of global surface temperatures by year 2300 being similar to millions of years ago the remaining carbon budget for staying beneath certain temperature increases is determined by modelling the carbon cycle and climate sensitivity to greenhouse gases according to unep global warming can be kept below 20 c with a 50 chance if emissions after 2023 do not exceed 900 gigatonnes of co2 this carbon budget corresponds to around 16 years of current emissions causes of recent global temperature rise the climate system experiences various cycles on its own which can last for years decades or even centuries for example el nio events cause shortterm spikes in surface temperature while la nia events cause short term cooling their relative frequency can affect global temperature trends on a decadal timescale other changes are caused by an imbalance of energy from external forcings examples of these include changes in the concentrations of greenhouse gases solar luminosity volcanic eruptions and variations in the earths orbit around the sun to determine the human contribution to climate change unique fingerprints for all potential causes are developed and compared with both observed patterns and known internal climate variability for example solar forcingwhose fingerprint involves warming the entire atmosphereis ruled out because only the lower atmosphere has warmed atmospheric aerosols produce a smaller cooling effect other drivers such as changes in albedo are less impactful greenhouse gases greenhouse gases are transparent to sunlight and thus allow it to pass through the atmosphere to heat the earths surface the earth radiates it as heat and greenhouse gases absorb a portion of it this absorption slows the rate at which heat escapes into space trapping heat near the earths surface and warming it over time while water vapour 50 and clouds 25 are the biggest contributors to the greenhouse effect they primarily change as a function of temperature and are therefore mostly considered to be feedbacks that change climate sensitivity on the other hand concentrations of gases such as co2 20 tropospheric ozone cfcs and nitrous oxide are added or removed independently from temperature and are therefore considered to be external forcings that change global temperatures before the industrial revolution naturally occurring amounts of greenhouse gases caused the air near the surface to be about 33 c warmer than it would have been in their absence human activity since the industrial revolution mainly extracting and burning fossil fuels coal oil and natural gas has increased the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere in 2022 the concentrations of co2 and methane had increased by about 50 and 164 respectively since 1750 these co2 levels are higher than they have been at any time during the last 14 million years concentrations of methane are far higher than they were over the last 800000 years global humancaused greenhouse gas emissions in 2019 were equivalent to 59 billion tonnes of co2 of these emissions 75 was co2 18 was methane 4 was nitrous oxide and 2 was fluorinated gases co2 emissions primarily come from burning fossil fuels to provide energy for transport manufacturing heating and electricity additional co2 emissions come from deforestation and industrial processes which include the co2 released by the chemical reactions for making cement steel aluminium and fertilizer methane emissions come from livestock manure rice cultivation landfills wastewater and coal mining as well as oil and gas extraction nitrous oxide emissions largely come from the microbial decomposition of fertilizer while methane only lasts in the atmosphere for an average of 12 years co2 lasts much longer the earths surface absorbs co2 as part of the carbon cycle while plants on land and in the ocean absorb most excess emissions of co2 every year that co2 is returned to the atmosphere when biological matter is digested burns or decays landsurface carbon sink processes such as carbon fixation in the soil and photosynthesis remove about 29 of annual global co2 emissions the ocean has absorbed 20 to 30 of emitted co2 over the last two decades co2 is only removed from the atmosphere for the long term when it is stored in the earths crust which is a process that can take millions of years to complete land surface changes around 30 of earths land area is largely unusable for humans glaciers deserts etc 26 is forests 10 is shrubland and 34 is agricultural land deforestation is the main land use change contributor to global warming as the destroyed trees release co2 and are not replaced by new trees removing that carbon sink between 2001 and 2018 27 of deforestation was from permanent clearing to enable agricultural expansion for crops and livestock another 24 has been lost to temporary clearing under the shifting cultivation agricultural systems 26 was due to logging for wood and derived products and wildfires have accounted for the remaining 23 some forests have not been fully cleared but were already degraded by these impacts restoring these forests also recovers their potential as a carbon sink local vegetation cover impacts how much of the sunlight gets reflected back into space albedo and how much heat is lost by evaporation for instance the change from a dark forest to grassland makes the surface lighter causing it to reflect more sunlight deforestation can also modify the release of chemical compounds that influence clouds and by changing wind patterns in tropic and temperate areas the net effect is to produce significant warming and forest restoration can make local temperatures cooler at latitudes closer to the poles there is a cooling effect as forest is replaced by snowcovered and more reflective plains globally these increases in surface albedo have been the dominant direct influence on temperature from land use change thus land use change to date is estimated to have a slight cooling effect other factors aerosols and clouds air pollution in the form of aerosols affects the climate on a large scale aerosols scatter and absorb solar radiation from 1961 to 1990 a gradual reduction in the amount of sunlight reaching the earths surface was observed this phenomenon is popularly known as global dimming and is primarily attributed to sulfate aerosols produced by the combustion of fossil fuels with heavy sulfur concentrations like coal and bunker fuel smaller contributions come from black carbon from combustion of fossil fuels and biomass and from dust globally aerosols have been declining since 1990 due to pollution controls meaning that they no longer mask greenhouse gas warming as much aerosols also have indirect effects on the earths energy budget sulfate aerosols act as cloud condensation nuclei and lead to clouds that have more and smaller cloud droplets these clouds reflect solar radiation more efficiently than clouds with fewer and larger droplets they also reduce the growth of raindrops which makes clouds more reflective to incoming sunlight indirect effects of aerosols are the largest uncertainty in radiative forcing while aerosols typically limit global warming by reflecting sunlight black carbon in soot that falls on snow or ice can contribute to global warming not only does this increase the absorption of sunlight it also increases melting and sealevel rise limiting new black carbon deposits in the arctic could reduce global warming by 02 c by 2050 the effect of decreasing sulfur content of fuel oil for ships since 2020 is estimated to cause an additional 005 c increase in global mean temperature by 2050 solar and volcanic activity as the sun is the earths primary energy source changes in incoming sunlight directly affect the climate system solar irradiance has been measured directly by satellites and indirect measurements are available from the early 1600s onwards since 1880 there has been no upward trend in the amount of the suns energy reaching the earth in contrast to the warming of the lower atmosphere the troposphere the upper atmosphere the stratosphere would also be warming if the sun was sending more energy to earth but instead it has been cooling this is consistent with greenhouse gases preventing heat from leaving the earths atmosphere explosive volcanic eruptions can release gases dust and ash that partially block sunlight and reduce temperatures or they can send water vapour into the atmosphere which adds to greenhouse gases and increases temperatures these impacts on temperature only last for several years because both water vapour and volcanic material have low persistence in the atmosphere volcanic co2 emissions are more persistent but they are equivalent to less than 1 of current humancaused co2 emissions volcanic activity still represents the single largest natural impact forcing on temperature in the industrial era yet like the other natural forcings it has had negligible impacts on global temperature trends since the industrial revolution climate change feedbacks the climate systems response to an initial forcing is shaped by feedbacks which either amplify or dampen the change selfreinforcing or positive feedbacks increase the response while balancing or negative feedbacks reduce it the main reinforcing feedbacks are the watervapour feedback the icealbedo feedback and the net cloud feedback the primary balancing mechanism is radiative cooling as earths surface gives off more heat to space in response to rising temperature in addition to temperature feedbacks there are feedbacks in the carbon cycle such as the fertilizing effect of co2 on plant growth feedbacks are expected to trend in a positive direction as greenhouse gas emissions continue raising climate sensitivity these feedback processes alter the pace of global warming for instance warmer air can hold more moisture in the form of water vapour which is itself a potent greenhouse gas warmer air can also make clouds higher and thinner and therefore more insulating increasing climate warming the reduction of snow co",
