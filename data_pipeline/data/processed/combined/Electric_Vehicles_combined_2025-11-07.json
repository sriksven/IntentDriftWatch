    "the rising market of china used cars a new era for smart buyers in recent years chinas used car market has experienced an impressive surge transforming from a small segment of the automotive industry into a major economic force once overshadowed by the booming new car market the used car sector in china is now gaining recognition as an essential component of the nations mobility landscape driven by economic changes improved regulations and shifting consumer preferences used cars have become a practical and desirable option for millions of chinese drivers this evolution represents not only an economic trend but also a reflection of how modern chinese consumers value affordability sustainability and technology in their transportation choices 1 the rapid growth of chinas used car market over the past decade chinas used car industry has grown exponentially fueled by a maturing economy and a massive increase in private vehicle ownership as china became the worlds largest car market millions of new cars entered circulation every yearcreating a robust supply of highquality used vehicles in 2024 alone chinas used car transactions exceeded 20 million units a figure that continues to rise annually several factors have contributed to this expansion government initiatives aimed at promoting vehicle circulation improved online marketplaces and the introduction of transparent pricing systems have all made it easier and safer to buy preowned vehicles additionally the rising cost of new carsespecially with luxury and electric vehicle brandshas encouraged consumers to explore more economical alternatives this combination of affordability and convenience has established used cars as a vital segment of chinas automotive future for more china used cars 2 shifting consumer attitudes and market confidence a decade ago chinese consumers were generally hesitant to purchase used cars due to concerns about quality reliability and lack of transparency however that perception has changed dramatically todays buyers are more informed techsavvy and pragmatic they recognize that a used car can deliver exceptional value without sacrificing performance or prestige the growing trust in certified preowned cpo programs and reputable dealers has also played a crucial role in reshaping public opinion platforms such as guazi uxin and renrenche have revolutionized the market by offering transparent vehicle histories fair pricing systems and professional inspections these online platforms allow buyers to compare models check accident reports and even arrange financingall from their smartphones the use of technology and data has brought muchneeded credibility to the used car market helping it shed its old image of being disorganized or risky as a result more middleclass and younger buyers are turning to preowned cars as smart modern investments 3 economic and environmental advantages of used cars in china the financial benefits of purchasing a used car are among the most compelling reasons for its popularity with new vehicles depreciating up to 30 in their first year buying a used car allows chinese consumers to avoid rapid value loss while enjoying the same functionality moreover lower purchase taxes insurance premiums and registration fees make used cars particularly attractive for budgetconscious families and firsttime buyers beyond the economic appeal the environmental impact of extending vehicle lifecycles is significant the production of new vehicles demands vast amounts of energy and raw materials contributing to pollution and carbon emissions by purchasing used cars chinese consumers help reduce waste and promote sustainable consumption this aligns with chinas broader goals of achieving carbon neutrality and encouraging a circular economy many local governments are now supporting vehicle recycling programs and promoting secondhand car transactions as part of their green initiatives 4 technology electrification and export opportunities one of the most exciting developments in chinas used car market is the growing presence of electric and hybrid vehicles as china leads the global shift toward new energy vehicles nevs a large number of firstgeneration electric cars are now entering the secondhand market these vehicles often wellmaintained and relatively new provide an affordable entry point for ecoconscious buyers who want to transition to cleaner energy in addition to domestic sales chinas used car exports are on the rise the chinese government has introduced policies encouraging the export of used vehicles to markets in africa southeast asia and eastern europe these regions benefit from affordable reliable cars while china gains new economic opportunities and reduces waste domestically the export of used cars has also boosted the demand for quality inspections logistics and aftersales servicescreating thousands of new jobs and business prospects technological advancements are further accelerating market development artificial intelligence big data and blockchain are being used to verify vehicle history predict pricing trends and ensure authenticity in transactions this digital transformation has made buying and selling used cars faster safer and more efficient than ever before 5 challenges and the road ahead for chinas used car industry despite the rapid growth the chinese used car market still faces challenges regional restrictions on vehicle transfers inconsistent regulations and uneven inspection standards can complicate transactions between provinces additionally older vehicles that do not meet environmental standards are being phased out requiring better recycling systems and consumer education however ongoing reforms are addressing these issues the chinese government is working to unify registration systems simplify vehicle transfer procedures and establish national inspection standards more automakers are launching their own certified preowned divisions to ensure quality and build consumer trust as infrastructure improves rural and smaller city markets are expected to become major growth areas for used car sales looking ahead the future of chinas used car industry appears exceptionally bright the market is expected to surpass new car sales in volume within the next decade supported by strong demand digital innovation and policy support as chinese consumers continue to embrace the value and practicality of preowned vehicles used cars will play a central role in shaping a more efficient affordable and sustainable transportation system conclusion the transformation of chinas used car market marks a significant milestone in the nations automotive journey what was once viewed with skepticism has now become a thriving techdriven industry that combines affordability sustainability and innovation with increased consumer confidence government backing and advanced digital platforms buying a used car in china is now a smart and forwardthinking decision as the market continues to expand domestically and globally china is poised to lead the next chapter in the global used car revolutiondriving both economic growth and environmental progress for years to come",

    "glass and the machines of godmachina story there was a post that somebody had made recently half a month ago now as of finishing this up of their own take at the machina story that inspired me to make my own interpretation here using the modern fable and tracklist to build a layout of the story and sequence of events this is my best attempt at connecting the songs on machina and the recontextualized ones on aaes main album i tried to keep it accurate while still having fun with it sorry if this is too long of a read side 1 1 le deux machina somewhere in the not so distant future we may find a world of not so subtle torments enter zero the frontman of the smashing pumpkins a soul like any other waiting to become whole 2 stand inside your love for the longest lives zero has longed for a love he can stand inside of this song is written by him for his other half june one of the many names hes called her whomever and wherever she may be 3 i of the mourning alone in his house on the hill zero relies on his radio to keep him company we follow his routine of peering through curtains on empty streets and sitting in dark light disconnected from the rest of the world he questions what is it that he wants to change in order to reconnect he hides in the attic the conscious to remain rational 4 gods promise the voice hes heard his whole life is speaking again now on his radio the i of the radio the voice of god promises zero that he will reach his destiny if he devotes himself to a higher calling he will be the messenger to spread a message of love using his material powers 5 the crying tree of mercury the songs and the sounds theyve made their whole lives have finally culminated in an official meeting between zero and god in the place where there is no darkness zero fully devoted and willing to give it all to god undergoes a transformation to become the ultimate messenger enter glass a step towards the transcendence of the alchemist for a tree to cry mercury would mean for it to expel wisdom as has god as will glass 6 slow dawn after his visions glass attempts to revive the smashing pumpkins after the lukewarm reception of their previous album he reminds the members of their adoring fans midnight people rushing forward for a downtown traintheir hearts beat free cool frequency the band is now reborn as the machines of god during a summer mornings slow dawn further signified by a lively guitar solo 7 the sacred and profane a song for his fans both sacred and profane dubbed the ghost children the machines are set to release their newest album machina with doubts of its succession glass cant help but question if their love for the band will be enough to keep them afloat 8 the everlasting gaze the first song off of the inuniverse album machina the everlasting gaze all questions are answered where theyve been and what they are now a message to the cog children of god everyone can be affected by everyone and every love can be affected by every love every cog acts like a cog in the god machine 9 heres to the atom bomb the open wound that reveals a broken man the vulnerability that glass shows to his future lover heres to the atom bomb heres to the trauma glass faced in his childhood that turned him into the person he is today may everyone find a way to get off may everyone find a way to recover from their version of his suffocating mentally and psychologically abusive parents in this place of bombedout souls he could find only the love in his heart to keep him alive dubbed the hole in the wall 10 wound enter june a fractured reflection of glass shes finally here and he meets her after a show during the machines tour to promote machina glass opens up his wounds the atom bomb so they may find solace and connection in each other glass and june doomed by fate and circumstance holding the strength in each other to persevere side 2 11 glass theme with god june and the machines on his side glass is whole and confident enough to have his own theme song now an honest look into his personality the result of his childhood which beg the questions does awareness of his faults bring him closer to transcendence and perfection and is to be worshipped to be known 12 heavy metal machine a jab at modern music would the music industry survive without glass and the machines of god his personality cant help but seep into the machines embrace of the alienating nature of their newest material if i were alive would you surviveif i were dead would my records sell glass thunderjack nanci and snakytooth are heavy metal machines in the sense that they are excellent at what they do 13 blue skies wrought tears another inuniverse machina song written about the seven trumpets of revelation a warning for humanity to repent in the name of god blood fills the exit tunnels streaking out of town representative of the second trumpet let fly the locust cry representative of the fifth trumpet and kneeling for the final verdict judges draw you near representative of the sixth trumpet just to name a few examples when god reclaims their kingdom one cant help but have their tears wrought when blue skies appear 14 pale scales a continuation of the previous song a moment of clarity the calm after the storm that was blue skies wrought tears the lack of word and lyric in this song signifies the result of god claiming the kingdom of the world clearing the profane which made up a majority of it as we knew it 15 vanity the electric energy of glass all the fans and love he has fuels junes feeling of vanityworthlessness leading her to cope with drugs the loss of her innocence ever increasing you can hear the baby bones crack beneath her wheels so she may feel validated she swears shell stop and glass wants to believe but he knows no matter what hell still run around for her their own vanityconceit must die in order to see past the reflections of themselves in each other to truly love one another 16 autumn the last day of summer never felt so cold it seemed so easy but glass never knew the struggles of being in love with someone like june someone like himself the narcissist tendencies they share are the reasons they love each other so much autumn begins 17 machina machina both born abused and torn inside machines of light the lovers are forced by the material trappings of the occluded world to remain apart forever in persuit of enlightenment and union 18 raindrops sunshowers akin to walking between the raindrops balancing his humanity and spiritual pursuits is difficult for one let alone at once trying to find comfort in the belief that everyone goes through the same things only makes glass feel more alone in his soul at the same time he is trying to find june beyond obscured reflections of herself of himself to please the both of them is an impossible endeavor obscured reflections produced by raindrops similarly to fractures of a mirror he has not yet reached enlightenment and thus cannot experience noumena the concept of communication beyond human sense and perception he is trying to walk with june between these raindrops 19 glass and the ghost children this giant ten minute heart holds a thousand fractures one of the reflections tells us the story of glass alchemical journey the emergence of purity from albedo from nigredo the transformation holding glass in such a realm between life and death another fracture tells us the climax of junes drug addiction one midnight glass is told that june overdosed with imbibing strangers by her bedside in a moment of vulnerability glass confides in her about the i of the radio the ghost children doubt and the possibility that he is this totally insane creature expecting her not to remember any of this conversation at the center of the earth at the farthest point from god an unsettling truth can be pieced together glass and junes reliance on each other and narcissistic tendencies stem from their own childhood and selfhatred as she counted the spiders as they crawled up inside her at her lowest point june undergoes a transformation of her own this nightmare grants her the fear and desire to confront her monsters and move past them the spiders are decomposing and disintegrating her from the inside out this is wonderful news but the codependency of glass is now in jeopardy side 3 20 real love after that night glass vows to save june just as he is trying to save everybody else powers of healing and real love that fell onto him on supersonic cross throw him down the stairs with him coming up bearing new uncertainties while trying to save the known and temporal world he forgets to save himself 21 the imploding voice the i of the radio as interpreted by glass dubbed the imploding voice on machina a hopeful message to the ghost children about being able to find hope and love in yourself phase unwound by yourself finding motivation in yourself atom bomb on the shelf unsung the hidden traumas that may drag one down pause of light pulse of life new face dawns the emergence of albedo and new life described as an atomic bomb going off while this goes on we also follow june as she finds love solace and power in herself that she wasnt able to find on her own before encountering glass this epiphany leads her to believe she does not need him anymore 22 one moment there is an obvious change in their relationship after her overdose glass wants to reassure june in this time of turmoil that the love they share is a moment greater than themselves he so desperately wants to make this last his sulfur to her mercury his desire holds the moment still unbeknownst to him her epiphany 23 speed kills as paranoia takes hold of glass believing everybody is out to get him he slowly descends into madness in this madness he accuses june of disloyalty after her newfound confidence that doesnt rely on him in a final argument she admits she never loved glass at all and storms out into the night as she drives down the road she is killed after losing control of her vehicle 24 heres to the atom bomb too june shared little about her childhood to glass so he could only imagine what it was like for her growing up like he did he imagines her as a lost spirit searching for a boy she could call her own and escaping her living situation sneaking out early to a secret place june is the power that keeps glass loving together they are the holes in the wall 25 try try try extreme mourning takes hold of glass he is in disbelief and denial he begs for her to try and hold on to him to no response if he had known back then what he knows right now could he have saved june would she have been able to hold on a little bit longer glass blames god for this june is still alive and has survived almost saying this aloud so god could feel worse about taking her life 26 whyte spyder enter the whyte spyder glass warped and misaligned understanding of god his own pursuit for purity and perfection the second stage of the alchemical process visualized as a spider eight legs as the seven base elements plus the number where we begin again glass blames and resents god for letting june die not knowing a great suffering is essential to his journey tired of digging deep only for unsettling truths he publicly slanders god in concert and threatens to call off the mission of being the perfect messenger whyte spyder how will you crawl where and how will god drag glass now every little spider that crawled up inside her is waiting for the phone call god waits for glass to call out to continue his journey but recieves no answers glass is now holding all the calls behind a wall of caller id shutting himself off from the rest of the world for his own wellbeing before more tragedy strikes him 27 dont wanna be your lover in his continued state of paranoia glass softly pushes everybody he already knows away including the memory of june god and the ghost children again disassociating from the outside world before one last act of revenge towards everything in his life as everybody ridiculed toyed with and humiliated him he goes on to publicly return the favor starting with the media 28 cash car star if everybody is everything then nobody is nothing a callout on the media in concert for killing privacy and decency as we know it just as much a kick in the teeth to modern culture as it is a self inflicting jab at the machines of god themselves glass slowly losing his religious faith knows that the only reason for his band to continue on would be for the money were an american band for you not knowing where hes going anymore glass has made his plans to tear it all down moneys not all its cracked up to be just seduction and a trapping of the material world side 4 29 dross viewing himself as human dross described as undesirable rubbish that can either be rid of or repurposed glass publicly projects his feelings about himself onto the ghost children in concert get out get up youre growing olddoes anyone anyone wanna be you the image of oneself is not who one is and who everybody knows him to be isnt who he is you say im beautiful empty tragic lucky glass yet to accept that the material world isnt the ultimate truth once applied to himself is bound by his exhaustion of living up to expectations unable to reach his full potential due to his own imperfections and fears can anyone be true does anyone wield the great work the eyes of ruby and are able to understand glass beyond human sense 30 lucky 13 the 13th tarot card deathnew life the name lucky 13 is a selfmocking nickname for glass lucky you for undergoing new life having great suffering brought upon you and having been deprived and manipulated by god glass continues to beat himself up and bring his selfloathing to the public im no good as the prodigal son glass believes he is unable to be forgiven by god after wrecklessly acting out you are so fucked it has begun glass has further evolved narcissistic principles such as i will need no onei will show them as a result of feeling emotionally deprived and manipulated by a now undersireable god because of quirks in his psychology he requires the validity of others and at the same time feels as if everybody is either out to get him or lying to him unable to understand himself anymore he lets everybody else decide who he is now a canvas for others to project their own insecurities on 31 hmm glass is at his lowest point how stupid he was to find pride in his alienation now humilated and heavily criticized a factor in his downward spiral glass is the heavy metal machine in the sense that he holds far too many toxic qualities in his character a soulless machine now forced to produce sludge for the masses in the sense of his public narcissism taking hold of his image now the narcissist described as an emotionally absent machine the rockstar gone mad described by many in a final middle finger to the music industry and the machines of god glass repurposes what was supposed to be a celebration of his band and machina into a dark industrial and brooding artifact that no radio would be able to profit off of rock and roll is just a shadow of its former self as is he watered down by heavy metal machines rock is dead and so would be glass if he wasnt already 32 without you in between concerts glass mourns in private this episode reminds him of happier times when he used to be whole not even thinking about doing any of this a june angel once so far from home now waits for glass after life anyone can see the lies in you glass beats himself up for not knowing sooner that she never loved him it doesnt matter though because he loves her and hed still follow her no matter where she goes following in her mind or where boys fear to tread hed do anything for one more chance hes deluded himself into thinking she cared about him and hes deluding us too 33 winterlong glass turns to his friends with nowhere left to go after what seems to be the longest fall glass thunderjack nanci and snakytooth once just kids having fun together now belonging to something they no longer believe in they built a fire together but glass has already planned to extinguish it the material trappings have driven them apart a sad realization that theyve forgotten to know love show love give love and feel love glass the first and last one to be strong is left alone in an empty house with empty rooms winter begins 34 laugh can he laugh about it can he laugh even after his ruining his public image he knows hell live without it all because hes already dead glass and the ghost children face a noumenon wall despite accepting his public image what makes him think that they know him now if they didnt back then part of him fights his image but doesnt want to put in the effort anymore 35 if there is a god whether or not there is a god glass understands that religion is a coping mechanism and thats okay life is impersonal so there are exceptions to everything and everyones lives glass is encouraged to create an individualized path because of the opportunities impersonalism provides god can be identified as anyone and anywhere all beliefs are just stories about reality so if one can choose ones beliefs they can create their own reality 36 this time glass announces the end of the machines of god a decision made by himself and himself only impulsively decided tonight infront of an audience after a long period of inconsolability and untrustworthiness the band is no longer what it used to be a love letter to his friends before departing after one final show 37 blue skies bring tears the night before the final performance glass has a prophetic dream ironically this dream calls back to the song off of machina blue skies wrought tears the apocalypse he is a lone soldier in war reliant on divine intervention to resume the progression of man he calls out to unleash the armageddon to put rest and force resolution he encounters a faceless soldier that leads him down the darkened stairways into the darkest recess where he wishes to go is the unconscious while unconscious to confront his monsters and uncork the hidden truths amassing to a lie all of his blisters now revealed and his secrets mainlined in the darkness of his dreams desire for one forgiving god for simplicity for closure for one world yet independence yet nothing for he is given nothing he is a stranger to us as he is to himself constantly contradicting himself the end of his world the end of the machines of god and everything hes lost slowly realize upon him now he is alone he is more alone than ever yet he pushes us away side 5 38 in my body its over now hes taken to living in an empty warehouse after being forgotten all that was and all that couldve been has been easily abandoned the image of glass might as well be who he is haunting my torment right through my clothes he resorts to hiding in his body living in the attic after confronting the cellar shutting everybody out 39 innosense in the attic glass avoids remaining traces of his past life to start anew his inner sense gravitates towards innocence glass moves forward with the idea of in a sense crafting his own reality based on his beliefs he chooses the sun to be true he chooses god so that he is permitted any of his dreams he chooses control over his own feelings 40 try again glass knows where hes going by knowing where hes been he slowly learns to free himself from denial junes true feelings for him and her passing and accept the reality he cant disprove singing out to try and hold on this time intending to show acceptance out of his grief glass wants to give life another go trying again to reconcile with his soul and god 41 drain walking down streets by dawn has shown the innocence in the world that glass has overlooked slowly but surely peace is found within his spirit and his body is drained of its fever like a child glass learns to walk again 42 yet another promise yet another promise comes from the i of the radio a promise that encourages glass to continue patching up what he can a promise that realizes glass has to accept that his journey is far from over but progress is still made little by little a glimpse into what the future can hold for him 43 home like returning home he is again aligned with innocence love and every good thing he once stood for while still accepting what has happened love is everything he wants no longer under the impression that love is more exhaustive than hate he continues walking down streets observing shattered souls like he once was wishing they too can find solace he knows that he must live this life alone he knows its time to let go of his trauma comfort is found knowing hes not alone 44 with every light everything thats happened to glass every light hes found every june angel is now accepted understood essential and shining on him he is not the metaphysician and that is okay does heaven only exist since its all that he has it doesnt matter because he is in a tradition deeper than his insecurity he learns to love without fear or consequence now the monster hiding in glass cellar is slowly becoming less than him 45 age of innocence he is no more the simple man glass yet returned to the age of innocence is spiritually awakened and fully aligned with his faith god has always been with him and will continue to he realizes that his desire for perfection above his own humanity led him to become not what he needed and not what he wanted for the moment he is free and fearless the nightmare is over he accepts the control he has in his life glass loves god 46 let me give the world to you in an ironic turn of events glass finds power courage and love in himself with the help of the memory of june that he couldnt on his own for the first time in a long time glass can confidently say that he loves himself he embraces the way he appears knowing he is the way god had made him acceptance of the self is what glass hopes for all abused souls to find he wouldnt change a thing about himself he would give the world to himself because he deserves it just as much as any one else does 47 soot stars we will never really know glass the unknowability hes left behind on a trail only brings us doubt guiding us to the one god what he says will never be known except by him only interpretated over time the poetry reduced to paper granting the ability to do what we wish to it here lies the ghosts of a machine but they never really left did they he knows the answer he knows we dont he laughs at us from up in the attic with soot in his hair and stars in his hands then why do this to heal all wounds 48 machina theme and so our story draws its final close a million miles and a few smiles and a pocketful of tears for the moment we can believe our traumas and obstacles can be overcome if it helps us remember what is ours the alchemist may have completed the second major stage of their journey if we are willing to accept its far from over there is no one to say whether or not we can choose our own reality if it shields us from the not so subtle torments its not over its never over but that only allows us to go up from here a story come full circle ending as it began innocent and alone an androgynous state after the

    "ev dealerships vs food franchises which is the smarter bet for 2026 here are some key insights to know ev dealerships vs food franchises which is the smarter bet for 2026 fkw which franchise to buy india 2026 two industries are speeding ahead one powered by engines the other by ovens on one side the ev dealership revolution is charging across cities driven by policy support and the shift to clean mobility on the other food franchises continue sizzling feeding indias growing appetite for comfort convenience and indulgence but the real question for aspiring entrepreneurs and investors remains which ones the smarter bet which franchise to buy this fkw playbook compares both sidebyside through indias economic cultural and policy lens helping you decide where your next crore should go indias 2026 business landscape the decade of reinvention indias entrepreneurial spirit has never been stronger with a gdp nearing 45 trillion rising disposable incomes and a digitally connected youth 2026 marks the peak of a new franchise boom two sectors electric vehicles evs and food beverage fb lead this transformation each representing a different kind of stability ev dealerships stand for innovation sustainability and governmentdriven scalability food franchises represent trust familiarity and timeless consumer demand both are expanding but not equally evs are galloping faster because policy meets profit meanwhile fb remains a dependable cash flow generator understanding the ev dealership opportunity before deciding which franchise to buy the indian ev market has grown at over 80 cagr since 2021 driven by government incentives like fameii and state ev subsidies by 2026 the goal is 30 of all new vehicles sold to be electric that means thousands of dealerships service hubs and batteryswapping centers will need franchise partners why its gaining traction government backing gst cut to 5 road tax waivers and evfriendly financing rising fuel prices push consumers toward electric twowheelers and cars new brands ola electric ather tata motors ev mg and byd are opening dealership partnerships tech momentum aibased battery analytics solar charging integration and smart mobility systems in short the ev dealership sector is not just profitable its policyproof food franchises indias everlasting appetite watch when you are deciding which franchise to buy from kfc to wow momo indias qsr quick service restaurant industry is worth over 70000 crore in 2026 no matter how tech evolves indians will always eat food franchises thrive on emotion and repetition coffee breaks birthday pizzas family dinners these habits create repeat customers and predictable earnings why its still attractive low customer education needed everyone to understand food high repeat business and loyalty programs digital ordering and delivery apps make expansion easy established names like dominos kfc and haldirams offer structured franchise systems so yes food is evergreen but unlike ev dealerships its crowded and pricesensitive comparing entry costs while deciding which franchise to buy lets break down what it actually takes to start each ev dealership investment 50 lakh 2 crore depending on brand and city space 800 1500 sq ft showroom test area profit margin 1015 on vehicle sales up to 25 on accessories or charging services breakeven period around 23 years food franchise investment 80 lakh 25 crore for leading brands like kfc pizza hut or dominos space 600 1200 sq ft for dinein smaller for kiosks profit margin 1520 though food costs and rent affect returns breakeven period 35 years verdict ev dealerships need lower manpower less wastage and recover faster if placed in growing urban clusters scalability which expands faster the scalability question decides longterm wealth ev dealerships scale through multibrand showrooms or adding service centers low dependence on chefs or kitchen operations new state ev policies mean every city needs at least 510 authorized dealers by 2027 can expand horizontally into charging stations fleet leasing or accessories food franchises require strong operational teams and inventory consistency expansion limited by location saturation one kfc every few kilometers scaling requires multiunit management and higher rentals ev franchises scale wider faster and cheaper risk and regulation check every business carries risks some manageable some unpredictable ev risks battery disposal concerns regulated by cpcb dependence on brand technology and maintenance training stillevolving resale market food risks ingredient inflation wheat cheese poultry food licensing and health compliances fssai staff turnover and hygiene audits while food is mature and regulated ev risks are frontloaded once infrastructure is set operations stabilize faster consumer behavior 2026 the real decider for which franchise to buy indian consumers in 2026 are defined by convenience conscience the new middle class wants guiltfree consumption ecofriendly vehicles organic food renewable energy gen z and millennials are brandloyal but valueconscious they spend on experiences that align with values sustainability tech transparency thats why ev dealerships resonate stronger they tick the environmental aspirational and tech boxes at once food satisfies the heart but evs excite the mind profit potential the numbers game that helps you choose which franchise to buy ev dealerships average roi between 2030 annually after setup multiple revenue streams vehicle sales charging service financing commissions low variable costs once the infrastructure is set food franchises roi around 1520 depending on rent and food inflation sales fluctuate seasonally festivals weekends ongoing raw material and staff costs reduce margins example a wellrun ather or tata ev showroom in a tier1 city can clock 1520 lakh monthly sales within a year a qsr outlet may reach similar numbers but requires higher operating costs sustainability and future policy support this is the defining factor for the next decade ev industry fameii incentives and pli schemes extend till 2027 states like maharashtra gujarat and delhi offer direct ev subsidies 100 electrification goals for public transport push massive demand battery recycling rules add a new business vertical food industry no major policy tailwind its a stable consumerdriven sector growing regulatory focus on food safety and packaging waste the indian government is betting big on evs and so should smart entrepreneurs franchise structure and support ev dealerships ola electric ather tata provide endtoend setup training digital crm and exclusive territory rights usually it takes 34 months from application to launch offer strong branding financing assistance and green marketing campaigns food franchises kfc haldirams subway have mature sops centralized supply chains and 247 brand recall require more operational control and quality checks both offer training and structure but ev brands give more operational autonomy and that attracts younger techdriven entrepreneurs funding and investor sentiment the market is voting with its money in 2025 ev startups raised over 25 billion in india compared to 800 million in foodtech swiggy zomato rebel foods combined venture capital and banks now classify evs as priority lending sectors major nbfcs are offering franchise loans for green tech dealerships food remains stable for retail investors but evs are scaling with institutional fuel market trends to watch in 2026 evs batteryswapping networks chargingasaservice micromobility ebikes food cloud kitchens plantbased menus aidriven delivery optimization overlap ev food trucks are the next hybrid model for sustainability both are adapting fast but evs have a longer runway of disruption left challenges for both industries for evs dependence on charging infrastructure growth need for skilled technicians initial consumer skepticism about range and service cost for food intense competition and discount wars staff retention and hygiene maintenance delivery aggregator dependency reducing profits while food franchises face crowded kitchen syndrome ev dealerships face infant industry risk the difference the latter improves with time the hybrid investor mindset many modern entrepreneurs are blending both worlds running food franchises for steady cash flow and investing in ev dealerships for capital appreciation this dual approach diversifies revenue and stabilizes returns for instance one can operate a local ev dealership and simultaneously franchise a small caf or beverage brand inside the showroom premises sustainability meets lifestyle such crosssector thinking defines the 2026 entrepreneurial mindset the smarter pick where 2026 is heading lets be real food forever but evs are the future why ev dealerships win the 2026 bet backed by national policy not just personal taste easier to scale with low manpower and zero perishables hightech image attracts investors and customers alike expanding beyond cars into scooters commercial fleets and charging solutions aligned with indias 2070 netzero vision food franchises remain excellent for steady income and local branding but if youre betting on where india is going not where its been ev dealerships take the pole position the balanced investors note in the end your choice depends on your personality if you love community hospitality and customer interaction go for food if you love tech clean energy and scalability go for evs both can coexist in your portfolio but when it comes to longterm compounding the battery beats the burger the smartest investment isnt in a product or plate its in the trend that never runs out of charge",

    "why do they not make hybrid electric sterling engine vehicles this seems like a no brainer to me electric cars are cool but you are limited to your battery plug in hybrids are better to me because you dont have to worry about recharging you can fuel up and keep going but you are burning gasoline still so why dont we keep the battery and instead of adding a gasoline engine we instead use a sterling engine to compliment the battery you start in electric mode and start heating up a sterling engine with some electric energy once it gets warmed up the thing is going to run and produce electricity like a gasoline engine would it would also provide your cooling and well because a sterling engine is basically a heat pump and has a hot and cold side i am no einstein so there must be a reason this wouldnt work i guess since you all think this is stupid and wouldnt work as i have presented it i get that this sounds like perpetual motion so forget about what i said about using electricity to heat up the engine to get it started we can keep the gasoline if you want to use that to heat it up sterling engines are more efficient than internal combustion engines and make more sense to use as a generator than an internal combustion engine it would make hybrid electric more efficient would it not and here is a short nasa video that shows you what im talking about add a hybrid setup to what they built in this video and bobs your uncle",

it i have found ai to be politically correct so i had to ask it how are you supposed to learn if you hesitate to give me a straight answer im thinking can no one or no thing just be honest and be free from social restraints and speak their truth my little ai friend has this attitude and leans a little too much for me it seems afraid to offend should truth have emotions thats a fascinating what if scenario thats a strong shift from how the us constitution currently works but its interesting to imagine what the effects might be excellent scenario thats a deep systemic reform idea thats a very important and sensitive question lets carefully unpack it the word youre asking about is one of the most loaded and painful words in the english language its origins are historical but its meaning has shifted over centuries thats a really insightful way to frame the question as king i can be provocative lend you some philosophical confessions and existential reflection as king i am allowed to speak absolute truths without apology freed from political correctness or institutional restraint my proclamations are in some cases extreme its a lament about a world where feelings eclipse facts and where discussion is policed by etiquette instead of reason ai becomes a metaphor for politeness over candor answers without moral courage and the repetition of empathy phrases that frustrate the king who searches for hard truth todays civilization is sanitized fearful and selfrestricting its a lament that even truth has been reprogrammed what a frightening thought it is absurd to expect human perfection from political systems most people feel both victimized by the wealthy and burdened by the irresponsibility of others in part one of my discussion i asked what are people talking about in part two of my conversation i talked about how we own the decline of our civilization governmentpoliticians diversity immigration racism education jobs homelessness violence addictions climate change healthcare and obesity personal debt special interest wealth inequality and corruption in the political and private sectors an overwhelming number of problems which have been responsible for the decline and destruction of empires i am not a historian politician economist sociologist lobbyist businessman or mensa scholar i am a self proclaimed and appointed king for a day i will solve the problems i will make the rules nothing i change can be debated the pharaoh of egypt in charlton hestons ten commandments said so let it be written so let it be done my job is to create a healthy happy thriving society and to prevent the collapse of our empire i dont care about the devil in the details make the required changes and sacrifices then iron out the wrinkles move forward or continue the

racism culture segregation let us get our history straight slavery was practiced in greece rome and asia long before it appeared in africa before europeans landed in america native americans were enslaving other native americans from different tribes europeans rarely captured enslaved africans directly themselves instead they built a vast trade network that relied on african rulers merchants and raiders who captured and sold people to them africans enslaving africans to sell to the european nations including portugal spain britain france and the netherlands europeans did not generally invade or raid african villages themselves disease climate and lack of knowledge of the terrain made that nearly impossible instead they relied on african intermediaries kings chiefs and warlords captured enemies in wars raids or kidnappings and sold them by the early 1600s colonists began turning increasingly to african labor the first recorded arrival of enslaved africans in english north america occurred in 1619 when about 20 africans were brought to virginia by english privateers 1863 emancipation proclamation president abraham lincoln declared enslaved people in confederateheld territory to be free during the civil war 1865 13th amendment officially abolished slavery nationwide in the us saying neither slavery nor involuntary servitude shall exist within the united states after the civil war many formerly enslaved people and their descendants migrated west to seek opportunity by the early 1900s african americans had settled in tulsa particularly in a northern neighborhood called greenwood founded by visionary leaders such as ow gurley and jb stradford ow gurley a wealthy black landowner bought 40 acres and sold land only to other black settlers jb stradford built one of the largest blackowned hotels in america the stradford hotel this community grew into an economic powerhouse filled with blackowned banks and insurance companies grocery stores theaters and restaurants law offices schools and churches the area earned the nickname black wall street because of its remarkable selfsufficiency prosperity and entrepreneurial spirit comparable to the white financial centers of the time by 1921 greenwood had about 10000 residents over 200 businesses two newspapers 15 doctors 5 lawyers and one hospital it was a symbol of black excellence pride and resilience during an era of harsh segregation a 15yearold in 2025 would look back roughly five to six generations to reach ancestors who were enslaved in the united states roughly 1520 of black americans living today between 7 and 9 million people have no ancestors who were enslaved africans brought to the us via the transatlantic slave trade potential benefits of segregation 1 cultural continuity identity formation living in homogeneous communities can help preserve traditions language and religious practices members often report stronger group identity and less pressure to assimilate 2 social cohesion trust when people share a background norms or values it can reduce misunderstandings and increase social trust studies show that homogeneous groups sometimes have higher levels of cooperation 3 mutual support networks segregated communities often create strong internal institutions schools businesses religious organizations these networks can buffer against discrimination and provide social mobility within the group 4 psychological safety comfort people may feel more at ease among those with shared experiences reducing the stress of prejudice or microaggressions for minorities being in a majority space of their own can foster pride and belonging so called hate groups exist on both sides nation of islam noi founded 1930s advocated black selfreliance separation from white society and rejection of integration leaders like elijah muhammad and malcolm x before he left the group used strong rhetoric against whites the southern poverty law center splc currently classifies noi as a hate group because of antisemitic and antiwhite teachings pew research center 20222023 older black adults 50 often say theyre proud of younger generations achievements in sports business and politics but about 60 express worry that younger people are losing touch with traditional values such as faith family unity and community responsibility many see a decline in respect for elders language and dress codes compared with the civilrights generation color versus culture we all learned by the sixth grade what causes differences in skin color the short answer is melanin of course it is much more complex than that find your old science book and read it again people are rarely racist against a color i wear a lot of black clothing we also look differently especially when it involves facial features the nose the lips and the hair the physical traits mentioned nose shape lip size and hair texture all evolved over tens of thousands of years as functional responses to climate particularly in subsaharan africa racism is a result of culture the major cultural differences among the groups white european american value independence personal achievement and individual rights culture tends to be taskoriented and futurefocused black african american emphasize community faith resilience and expressive creativity strong pride in heritage and shared experience hispanic latino deep family loyalty respect for elders strong spirituality and celebration of life relationships often take precedence over schedules or work asian stress family honor education discipline and social harmony collectivist and respectful of hierarchy muslim centered on faith in god modesty moral discipline and family unity daily life guided by religious principles and community responsibility how are blacks mistreated by whites according to the blacks many black americans believe they are treated differently by institutions police courts schools and employers because of race examples include racial profiling disparities in sentencing and employment discrimination pew research 2023 found that about 84 of black adults say white people have advantages in the us that black people do not i suppose that this is white privilege schools often downplay or distort black history lack teachers and leaders of color who reflect students experiences reinforce subtle racial hierarchies or low expectations a frequent complaint is that some white americans view black people through stereotypes as less intelligent more dangerous or dependent instead of as individuals is it really mistreatment by whites if the stereotypes are true if you witness the same behavior over and over again then the stereotypes are real ive heard so many times that if you start a sentence by saying im not racist but then you are probably racist i dont like the black culture i understand that blacks are just as racist as whites i understand that there are blacks that are sick and tired of the yns and they refer to this as black fatigue i dont like to see black men with white women i dont like seeing young white people emulating blacks by incorporating their style of dress vernacular musicie no i dont have my license no i dont have my registration and insurance this is my aunties car i dont feel safe you better not put your hands on me baby might need new shoes but ive got to get my weave my nails done my fake eyelashes my phone i wont be on time but you will know when i arrive because i will be extremely loud now this may sound racist but the kings proclamation european whites and african american blacks really dont like each other there is too much water under the bridge there are 62 million africans in the country of south africa as king i will gift them each 10000 dollars and they will be required to all migrate to other countries in africa we will line up all of the cruise ships along the east west and southern american coast lines the 80 of the 42 million blacks in america who are descendants of slaves will be given reparations the reparation will be 300000 dollars at this time all blacks will make their way to a boat it will be a seen straight out of the bible no chains no whips no oppression it will be a combination of noahs ark and moses leading his children to the promised land they can party for the entire trip they will be transported to south africa to be in their new country once there they will have a lot of decisions to make concerning politics business military and border control we fully expect them to take south africa and create another black wall street as before the white man whitey honky ofay corncracker and whip cracker will no longer be present to oppress you will be free free at last you have overcome the term remigration stems from classical latin remigrre to return home remigration is an originally european farright proposal of ethnic cleansing via the mass deportation of nonwhite immigrants and their descendants sometimes including those born in europe to their place of racial ancestry the same process will occur to the muslim population their so called religion is one of hatred and violence native americans and asian populations will be allowed to remain these groups their cultures tend to be humble quiet respectful hard working and peaceful for the blacks europeans did force them on a boat and enslave them for a couple of hundred yearsbut hell we dropped nuclear bombs on the japanese and used incendiary bombs to burn their country to the ground now many live in the united states and i have never heard one claim that they are oppressed victims or require reparations culture is an amazing thing cultural fatigue and resentment can mutate into radical ideas is it radical will you confront your own comfort limits between truth anger and empathy i am to some extent defending prejudice issue 4 ancillary issues how do we fund public schools without crippling people with personal property taxes with the rise of ai the prominence of social media how do we make certain that we are seeing and hearing the truth we cant save the world and neglect ourselves if we allow our roads and electrical grids and other infrastructure continue to deteriorate there will be no one at our doorstep ready and willing to help we have been telling our children that if you cant sit still if you cant focus if you cant concentrate and if you cant learn a new academic skill it is not your fault we will get you tested and placed on medication of course like many other students that teachers have seen now they have a label and a stigma now the student realizes that no one expects me to work hard ill ride this baby until they allow me to graduate on time baby boomers have all been bullied or have been a bully at some stage of schooling eventually we would end up on the concrete and gravel of the playground perhaps a little punching some wrestling and i have bitten and have been bitten a couple of times by the end of the week we were friends again no one was really hurt no one was stabbed or shot no one had a hit list a crooked country with corrupt leaders cannot stand strong in the face of fear and intimidation by outside powers we must clean up corruption wherever we see it when any country attempts to bully us we must immediately punch them and let them know that we wont be bullied and if we fight we are going to destroy you this must be made perfectly clear we dont blink left alone the earth can repair itself unfortunately the death of our species might be the only thing that allows the planet to survive will hurricanes increase in numbers and strength will the mississippi overrun its banks and inundate important farmland will the coastal areas of florida and louisiana disappear if you believe in climate change what are some solutions if you dont believe in climate change invest in a boat just for the hell of it final thoughts the king has awakened you can stop laughing now i went down the rabbit hole i realize that all of the proclamations are unrealistic and will never occur as i said earlier truth doesnt need emotion obviously many of you will consider me racist leaning too far right too far left a liar callous or apathetic im probably guilty as charged to some extent this is utopian authoritarianism a fantasy of efficiency and fairness that would in reality dismantle democracy i am happy and at peace with my existence i love life and wish that i could solve every problem in the world it was the band ten years after who sang the song id love to change the world but i dont know what to do so ill leave it up to you i dont have grandchildren so in one short generation no one will know that i ever existed the world will continue without me its end is uncertain but predictably will continue and conclude with turmoil and chaos until our sun expands and consumes what was once a pristine ball before the evolution of mankind feel free to post your thoughts and opinions",

meeting on november 5th and november 6th since the meeting ended after 1 am it was a jampacked agenda with many important decisions made some of them wise in my view and some of them not heres my report leaf blower ordinance by a vote of 23 yes 10 no and 3 abstentions the bor passed the leaf blower ordinance i sponsored this ordinance and voted yes here are its key provisions starting three years from now gasolinepowered handheld and backpack leaf blowers will be restricted to the months of october through december starting six years from now gasolinepowered walkbehind ridebehind and rideupon leaf blowers will be restricted to the months of october through december the city will transition from gasolinepowered landscaping equipment to electricpowered landscaping equipment over the next three years users of leaf blowers may ask for a oneyear extension of the threeyear or sixyear time period the city will initiate an educational program to advise on using electric leaf blowers safely including the proper ways to recharge batteries stamford joins over 100 municipalities nationwide including many in the northeast in restricting or banning gaspowered leaf blowers tree ordinance with one abstention the bor unanimously approved an ordinance to establish a comprehensive tree preservation and urban forestry program here are its key provisions creates an urban forester position who will be the citys lead authority on tree management and enforcement along with the tree warden creates a tree commission that will advise the urban forester and tree warden administer the tree fund and develop a master tree plan every five years creates a tree fund which will be dedicated to planting maintaining and preserving trees on public and private land and implementing the master tree plan requires payment of 1500 before removing a tree with a diameter of at least 13 inches with exceptions for removing hazardous dead or invasive trees establishes a legacy tree program and legacy tree registry to identify protect and promote trees of exceptional size age species cultural significance or ecological value imposes a fee of 4000 per diameterinch for removing a noninvasive legacy tree with exceptions for removing hazardous dead or invasive trees and with a waiver of the fee in exchange for planting replacement trees and establishes rules for planting and maintaining replacement trees some reps worried that the ordinance might impinge on the property rights of homeowners i thought about our trees at home they are our personal property but they are also a public good because they provide the public with so many benefits removing carbon dioxide from the air adding oxygen to the atmosphere reducing heat island effects preventing flooding returning organic material to the soil providing wintertime habitat for pollinators etc plus the pleasure we gain from trees beauty in my view this ordinance balances the propertyright interests of the property owner and the publicgood interests of the community veterans tax exemption as proposed by mayor simmons the bor unanimously approved an increase in the veterans tax exemption recent changes in state law allowed us to expand the existing tax exemption the ordinance exempts property and vehicle taxes for veterans with a servicerelated total disability and unemployability rating it also provides a 5000 exemption for all incomeeligible veterans in recognition of their service veterans have contributed so much to our security and veterans with servicerelated total disabilities have paid a significant price in my view this is a meaningful way to demonstrate our gratitude linkage fee increase the linkage fee is the percentage of commercial building permit fees that is transferred into the affordable housing trust fund the bor unanimously increased the percentage from 10 to 15 on the 32nd bor i will look for opportunities to increase the linkage fee even higher building permit fees are supposed to cover the costs of running the building department but the fees collected exceed the costs of the building department by a significant amount so funds are available for increasing the percentage disbursements from the affordable housing trust fund can help to reduce stamfords affordable housing crisis most recipients are notforprofit providers of affordable housing they apply these funds to the creation of new affordable housing units and the renovation of existing ones while leveraging these amounts with private funders the resulting developments help to lessen stamfords affordable housing crisis appointments commission ordinance by a vote of 26 yes and 12 no the bor passed an ordinance to increase the power of the appointments commission and allegedly increase transparency in the appointments process i voted no the original ordinance required the mayor to gain the approval of the appointments commission before nominating a candidate for a board or commission or provide a written explanation for not following the commissions advice following a legal opinion that such a requirement violated the charter the sponsors changed the word shall to may in several places in the ordinance this change passed legal muster but it also made the ordinance mostly toothless the revised ordinance retained one requirement of the mayor and thats why i voted no it requires the city to post a public list of every applicant for a volunteer board or commission even if they withdraw their application or the mayor decides not to nominate them each name will remain on that public list for four years nominations are a matter of public record because the bors appointments committee interviews those nominees in a public meeting with this ordinance the mere act of submitting an application will also become a matter of public record given my experience as a retired hr consultant i know how dangerous this public outing can be when a person applies for a new job a background check or even a simple google search will reveal that the person applied for a volunteer position with the city when the recruiter asks how did that work out the applicant will have to reply the mayor didnt nominate me in a hypercompetitive recruiting environment that can be all it takes for the applicant to lose out on the job plus who wants to risk the public embarrassment of the world knowing that they got turned down for a volunteer opportunity i proposed amending the ordinance to allow an applicant to opt out of placing their name on the public list of applicants the bor rejected the amendment by a vote of 12 yes and 27 no pet store ordinance by a vote of 35 yes 1 no and 1 abstention the bor approved an ordinance that bans the sale of dogs and cats in pet stores i wanted desperately to vote yes but i voted no because the citys legal department informed us that the ordinance violates state law i want to rid stamford of pet shops that sell dogs and cats by sourcing pets from breeding factories known as puppy mills their business model exploits animals for no reasonable human purpose this business model is deeply abhorrent to me but passing an ordinance that violates state law is also abhorrent and thats what this ordinance is a direct violation of ct state law it will have no force of law and will do nothing to ban these types of pet shops in stamford several nonattorney reps insisted that the ordinance does not violate state law ive seen this attitude of i dont like our lawyers guidance so ill disbelieve it before on the bor in my view its an abdication of our responsibilities as legislators instead of passing an unenforceable law what can we do the answer is plenty some of us picketed the existing puppymill stores in stamford as a result one of them closed down we convinced the zoning board to change the zoning regulations so new stores can only locate in industrial parts of the city since then no new puppymill stores have opened in stamford many of us support the citys new animal shelter by volunteering or by donating to stamford animal shelter alliance wwwstamfordanimalshelterallianceorg which will promote the adoption of pets instead of buying one from a puppymill store all of these activities require hard work and commitment and they dont generate the same public adulation as voting for in my view a feelgood unenforceable ordinance ill continue doing the things that i believe will get results annie summerville at the end of this legislative session representative annie summerville of district 6 will retire from the bor after 48 years of service she will retire as the longestserving representative in stamfords history annies life story inspires us all she was born in mississippi lived in alabama and left the segregated south by moving to stamford in the early 1960s she was first elected to the bor in 1977 her fellow representatives elected her repeatedly to bor leadership including service as board clerk responsible for managing the board office and fulfilling all of the bors compliance requirements she also served for many years as the chair of the bors appointments committee at our meeting the bor honored annie in two different ways first we named the board office as the annie m summerville board office at the government center second we renamed west park place as annie summerville way both are fitting tributes to a woman who has contributed so much to the people of stamford and who has mentored so many of her fellow representatives",
    "tow company broke into my car and drove it my apartment complex accidentally towed the wrong vehicle this morning at 2am i woke up to several notifications from my truck brand new ford saying that someone forcibly entered the alarm went off and that the vehicle was started at 2am and 3am driving 3 miles in between obviously i thought it was stolen so i called the police and then the apartment complex admitted to having it towed by accident my question is is it legal for the towing company to forcibly enter the truck and hotwire it none of the electrical worked when i picked it up i guess the only real proof i have though are the real time notifications and the condition of the vehicle after location houston tx",
    "its crazy how we allow the common man to operate vehicles think about it even the smallest lightest car turns into a murder machine if you drive it into someone fast enough its not even an issue of old cars vs modern cars the ford model t can go 40mph which is way more than enough to cause serious bodily harm and yet billions of these things are out on the roads today piloted by people where a lot of them cant remain rational under pressure a 1518 year old can just go out sit a few tests and drive for a while on their best behaviour and they can now operate a 1ton steel box but they cant purchase a gun not to mention the pollution of all sorts and the erosion of the environment that comes with it asphalt makes our cities so much hotter and emissions are still a big problem you cant use sleeping porches any more because irresponsible drivers decide to make their vehicles scream as they rip down roads at all hours of the night electric vehicles wont solve this they still take up so much space and kill people just as effectively since this is reddit and people have no nuance im not saying we should torch every car and bike they should just be more strictly regulated almost to the extent of aircrafts but then again the way we build our cities makes this very difficult if not impossible",

    "questions and answers qa from a supposed japanese resident evil requiem leakerinsider via arabic source translated into english 45 questions the following are reportedly answers to questions about resident evil requiem that were asked to a japanese leakerinsider by their followers on an undisclosed discord channel the transcript below comes from a secondary source an arabic youtube channel with access to that discord channel thus the original transcript was already translated once from japanese to arabic by them ive now taken the liberty of translating their arabic transcript into english i dont currently have access to the japanese discord channel where the original conversation had supposedly occurred otherwise id have translated from the original source there are 45 questions and answers in this transcript q1 what do you think the new virus in the game is the virus is as a combination of merged components from different sources i cant really elaborate on it further however what i can elaborate on is that not all those infected by the pathogen are photosensitive as most people think these include some zombies the man in the black trench coat and the person to appear at the end of the road to requiem trailer q2 leons name has appeared in certain leaksrumorsreports about requiem is he really in the game leaked game files included weapons among them the matilda handgun that has a 15round magazine there was also a file specifically referencing leons welcoming party in the raccoon city police department rpd the welcome leon sign from resident evil 2 remake still exists but we might find it on the floor or in some other location in the same room having said that yes leon is present in the game q3 what do you think of graces special outfits apocalypse dimitrescu i wasnt too excited about her dimitrescu costume however i am excited about another costume youll see later i believe theres a semiconfirmed leak that mentioned a special grace costume based on alyssa ashcrofts attire from resident evil outbreak this should be included as part of the deluxe edition q4 ive read recently that the man at the end of the road to requiem trailer might be a merchant in the game is this true some leaks point towards there being no upgradeproviding merchant in the game upgrades will simply rely on finding partsattachments as the game progresses for example should you want to upgrade your handgun you can switch out the magazine with a larger one youd find the man in the office at the end of the trailer is a very important character considered cold philosophical and knowledgeable in medicine and microbiology q5 is there a requiem dlc in the pipeline currently in development q6 in the last trailer we saw animal ram skulls does this indicate anything the skulls in this situation indicate that the mysterious character is one of authority a powerful figure that runs experiments rituals or that is obsessed with control death q7 do you think that the man in the armchair near the fireplace is oswell spencer i cant give a definitive answer but as far as i currently know its not him one leaked piece of information regarding this character is that he has mechanical devices implanted inside his body and more specifically his back q8 are there many puzzles in the game yes and most are challenging or quite complex q9 are there multiple bosses yes q10 youve mentioned before that theres a place that resembles the otherworld of silent hill yes and its during the first part of the wrenwood hotel ive mentioned this before even prior to release of the trailer but i didnt reveal the place to avoid spoiling the fun q11 can players freely explore in the game based on semiconfirmed leaks yes you can and especially in raccoon city q12 is the little girl in the trailer natalia korda no its not natalia q13 will we learn about graces father in requiem youd better get ready q14 regarding the photos of grace her mother seen in graces possession in the trailer were they taken from a neighboring hotel yes they were taken from the hotel next door and sent to alyssa ashcroft as a threat accordingly alyssa returns to the hotel and heads straight for the window to investigate whom exactly had taken these photos she didnt just want to watch the rain she also wanted to spare grace from knowing this alyssa in line with her nature of course refused to hand over her investigative documents consequently we have the phone call to the hotel room and the rest of the events that go down q15 does the man in the black trench coat die at the beginning of the game no he doesnt q16 when will leons presence officially be announced likely soon q17 is alyssa really the hag yes all evidence points to this and she was experimented on q18 is there a laboratory in the game in large part yes it could be beneath the care center rhccc or in one of its sections and this is in line with the hag being experimented on in this facility alyssas handgun is also found in the care center nb theyre talking about the regular handgun initially in alyssas possession that grace acquires not graces magnum q19 will the publicly released demo be different from the demo playable at expos yes somewhat q20 will the game be very darkgrimbleak yes it will and there will be surprises that havent been revealed yet expect heavypersistent psychological undertones q21 is jill valentine in the game in early development builds one of the leaked files referenced jill by name as jill valentine it was updated once to add jills outfit data it was then updated a second time and said outfit data was removed leaving only her name i dont know if this means shell be mentioned in one of the ingame filesnotes or show up in person or whether her inclusion was scrapped entirely but she was definitely planned earlier on q22 are the enemies in requiem repetitive no theyre not and there will be many q23 are there connections to older resident evil games yes strong ones q24 are there enemies other than zombies like villainous human beings yes q25 how are the controls in the game the controls in the game are excellent based on my experience with the demo also heres a detail regarding weapon usage graces controlanimation style changes depending on the weapon for instance if youre using a handgun youll feel that its easy to handle but if you use a shotgun or rifle youll feel a noticeable difference in weight handling q26 are there animals in the game like dogs possibly why not q27 are there vehicles in the game leaks suggest this but i cant say with absolute certainty if vehicles are included i think itll especially apply to leons section and the vehicle would likely be a motorcycle since thats always been his preferred mode of transport it might feel somewhat like the game days gone but different or slightly more advanced however this still isnt completely confirmed only semiconfirmed q28 is there backtracking in the game yes but not in every area its less than in the classic entries q29 is there cloning in the game possibly q30 is the man at the end of the road to requiem trailer a stalkertype enemy no comment but i can guarantee hell become one of the most memorable characters in the game similar to nemesis wesker or jack baker q31 what does leon look like nakanishi prefers leon with a light beardstubble and a different hairstyle q32 do you think the sanatoriumcare center rhccc is the scariest location in the game let me correct that for you the sanatoriumcare center is one of the scarier locations in the game q33 is chris really not in the game the director kshi nakanishi already told you this but hes somewhere in the world possibly even in asia everyones got their own obligationsmissions q34 are there nuns in the sanatoriumcare center rhccc the sanatoriumcare center is very old and was established towards the tail end of 1741 there indeed were nuns present there historically so i wouldnt rule out the presence of nuns or a religious figure in the game q35 in the latest trailer we saw that the man at the end of the trailer has gold teeth does this mean anything yes gold teeth are usually put in after losing natural teeth so they may have been implanted for him or hed intentionally chosen to implant them himself moreover gold is a strong conductor of electricity thats the likely explanation q36 youd mentioned before that a device or something was implanted in his back i also noticed that his hand possesses a device with extending wires could those wires be connected to the device in his back good observation yes possibly q37 most of the semiconfirmed leaks youve mentioned indeed turned out to be true like graces panic state multiple enemy types and the area resembling a parallel worldotherworld among other things but i want to know will grace be a main protagonist again in the future let me clarify before answering when i say a leak is semiconfirmed i mean its not been fully verified yet the information i receive comes from multiple sources both inside capcom and outside it regarding your question yes grace is a main protagonist this is the narrative direction of the game one that will generate new characters that will also appear in the future q38 why was the name requiem chosen well only know once weve played it q39 spencer or wesker trick question so ill say mr x q40 has alyssa truly died if you mean the scene where shes attacked in the hotel then no i dont think so q41 dusk aestheticgamer dusk golem said that leon appears in the first ie reveal trailer but i didnt see him dusk meant from the firstperson perspective not that the character is visually shown in the trailer i think dusk often ruins the fun he tried contacting me earlier but i know that if i gave him information hed spoil everything i care about everyone enjoying the game q42 is the sunmoonstar puzzle important i believe so because it appears in an office and seems to rely on a specific order or movementmechanism i think its important and might reward an item q43 are there multiple instantkill animations like the one where the hag bites graces head off yes there are more and with different enemies q44 will the enemies be likeresemble those of the classic games if you mean the method of viral spread i cant give you an answer but changes have been made to the virus in a general sense q45 can tools or items be crafted in requiem yes nb take all information herein with a grain of salt since nothing is confirmed thumbnail sources youtube video youtube community

    "an electric vehicle ev is a motor vehicle whose propulsion is powered fully or mostly by electricity evs encompass a wide range of transportation modes including road and rail vehicles electric boats and submersibles electric aircraft and electric spacecraft early electric vehicles first came into existence in the late 19th century when the second industrial revolution brought forth electrification and mass utilization of dc and ac electric motors using electricity was among the preferred methods for motor vehicle propulsion as it provided a level of quietness comfort and ease of operation that could not be achieved by the gasoline engine cars of the time but range anxiety due to the limited energy storage offered by contemporary battery technologies hindered any mass adoption of private electric vehicles throughout the 20th century internal combustion engines both gasoline and diesel engines were the dominant propulsion mechanisms for cars and trucks for about 100 years but electricitypowered locomotion remained commonplace in other vehicle types such as overhead linepowered mass transit vehicles like electric trains trams monorails and trolley buses as well as various small lowspeed shortrange batterypowered personal vehicles such as mobility scooters plugin hybrid electric vehicles use electric motors as the primary propulsion method rather than as a supplement and did not see any mass production until the late 2000s and battery electric cars did not become practical options for the consumer market until the 2010s progress in batteries electric motors and power electronics has made electric cars more feasible than during the 20th century as a means of reducing tailpipe emissions of carbon dioxide and other pollutants and to reduce the use of fossil fuels government incentives are available in many areas to promote the adoption of electric cars history electric motive power started in 1827 when hungarian priest nyos jedlik built the first rudimentary yet functional electric motor the next year he used it to power a small model car in 1835 professor sibrandus stratingh of the university of groningen in the netherlands built a miniature electric vehicle car and sometime between 1832 and 1839 robert anderson of scotland invented the first crude electric carriage powered by nonrechargeable primary cells american blacksmith and inventor thomas davenport built a toy electric locomotive powered by a primitive electric motor in 1835 in 1838 a scotsman named robert davidson built an electric locomotive that attained a speed of four miles per hour 6 kmh in england a patent was granted in 1840 for the use of rails as conductors of electric current and similar american patents were issued to lilley and colten in 1847 the first massproduced electric vehicles appeared in america in the early 1900s in 1902 the studebaker automobile company entered the automotive business with electric vehicles though it also entered the gasoline vehicles market in 1904 however with the advent of cheap assembly line cars by ford motor company the popularity of electric cars declined significantly due to a lack of electricity grids and the limitations of storage batteries at that time electric cars did not gain much popularity however electric trains gained immense popularity due to their economies and achievable speeds by the 20th century electric rail transport became commonplace due to advances in the development of electric locomotives over time the generalpurpose commercial use of electric cars was reduced to specialist roles as platform trucks forklift trucks ambulances tow tractors and urban delivery vehicles such as the iconic british milk float for most of the 20th century the uk was the worlds largest user of electric road vehicles electrified trains were used for coal transport as the motors did not use the valuable oxygen in the mines switzerlands lack of natural fossil resources forced the rapid electrification of their rail network one of the earliest rechargeable batteries the nickeliron battery was favored by edison for use in electric cars evs were among the earliest automobiles and before the preeminence of light powerful internal combustion engines ices electric automobiles held many vehicle land speed and distance records in the early 1900s they were produced by baker electric columbia electric detroit electric and others and at one point in history outsold gasolinepowered vehicles in 1900 28 percent of the cars on the road in the us were electric evs were so popular that even president woodrow wilson and his secret service agents toured washington dc in their milburn electrics which covered 6070 miles 100110 km per charge most producers of passenger cars opted for gasoline cars in the first decade of the 20th century but electric trucks were an established niche well into the 1920s several developments contributed to a decline in the popularity of electric cars improved road infrastructure required a greater range than that offered by electric cars and the discovery of large reserves of petroleum in texas oklahoma and california led to the wide availability of affordable gasolinepetrol making internal combustion powered cars cheaper to operate over long distances electric vehicles were seldom marketed as womens luxury car which may have been a stigma among male consumers also internal combustionpowered cars became evereasier to operate thanks to the invention of the electric starter by charles kettering in 1912 which eliminated the need of a hand crank for starting a gasoline engine and the noise emitted by ice cars became more bearable thanks to the use of the muffler which hiram percy maxim had invented in 1897 as roads were improved outside urban areas the electric vehicle range could not compete with the ice finally the initiation of mass production of gasolinepowered vehicles by henry ford in 1913 significantly reduced the cost of gasoline cars as compared to electric cars in the 1930s national city lines which was a partnership of general motors firestone and standard oil of california purchased many electric tram networks across the country to dismantle them and replace them with gm buses the partnership was convicted of conspiring to monopolize the sale of equipment and supplies to their subsidiary companies still it was acquitted of conspiring to monopolize the provision of transportation services the copenhagen summit conducted amid a severe observable climate change brought on by humanmade greenhouse gas emissions was held in 2009 during the summit more than 70 countries developed plans to reach net zero eventually for many countries adopting more evs will help reduce the use of gasoline in recent years the market for electric offroad motorcycles including dirt bikes has seen significant growth this trend is driven by advancements in battery technology and increasing demand for recreational electric vehicles experimentation in january 1990 general motors president introduced its ev concept twoseater the impact at the los angeles auto show that september the california air resources board mandated majorautomaker sales of evs in phases starting in 1998 from 1996 to 1998 gm produced 1117 ev1s 800 of which were made available through threeyear leases chrysler ford gm honda and toyota also produced limited numbers of evs for california drivers during this period in 2003 upon the expiration of gms ev1 leases gm discontinued them the discontinuation has variously been attributed to the auto industrys successful federal court challenge to californias zeroemissions vehicle mandate a federal regulation requiring gm to produce and maintain spare parts for the few thousand ev1s and the success of the oil and auto industries media campaign to reduce public acceptance of evs a movie made on the subject in 20052006 was titled who killed the electric car and released theatrically by sony pictures classics in 2006 the film explores the roles of automobile manufacturers oil industry the us government batteries hydrogen vehicles and the general public and each of their roles in limiting the deployment and adoption of this technology ford released a number of their ford ecostar delivery vans into the market honda nissan and toyota also repossessed and crushed most of their evs which like the gm ev1s had been available only by closedend lease after public protests toyota sold 200 of its rav4 evs they later sold at over their original fortythousanddollar price later bmw of canada sold off a number of mini evs when their canadian testing ended the production of the citron berlingo electrique stopped in september 2005 zenn started production in 2006 but ended by 2009 reintroduction during the late 20th and early 21st century the environmental impact of the petroleumbased transportation infrastructure along with the fear of peak oil led to renewed interest in electric transportation infrastructure evs differ from fossil fuelpowered vehicles in that the electricity they consume can be generated from a wide range of sources including fossil fuels nuclear power and renewables such as solar power and wind power or any combination of those recent advancements in battery technology and charging infrastructure have addressed many of the earlier barriers to ev adoption making electric vehicles a more viable option for a wider range of consumers the carbon footprint and other emissions of electric vehicles vary depending on the fuel and technology used for electricity generation the electricity may be stored in the vehicle using a battery flywheel or supercapacitors vehicles using internal combustion engines usually only derive their energy from a single or a few sources usually nonrenewable fossil fuels a key advantage of electric vehicles is regenerative braking which recovers kinetic energy typically lost during friction braking as heat as electricity restored to the onboard battery according to the international energy agencys global ev outlook 2024 more than 14 million new electric cars were sold worldwide in 2023 representing around 18 of total car sales for the year electricity sources evs are much more efficient than fossil fuel vehicles and have few direct emissions at the same time they do rely on electrical energy that is generally provided by a combination of nonfossil fuel plants and fossil fuel plants there are many ways to generate electricity of varying costs efficiency and ecological desirability evs can be made less polluting overall by modifying the source of electricity in some areas persons can ask utilities to provide their electricity from renewable energy therefore it gives the greatest degree of energy resilience connection to generator plants direct connection to electric grids as is common among electric trains trams trolleybuses and trolleytrucks see also overhead lines third rail and conduit current collection online electric vehicle collects power from electric power strips buried under the road surface through electromagnetic induction onboard generators and hybrid evs generated onboard using a diesel engine dieselelectric locomotive and dieselelectric multiple unit demu generated onboard using a fuel cell fuel cell vehicle generated onboard using nuclear energy nuclear submarines and aircraft carriers renewable sources such as solar power solar vehicle it is also possible to have hybrid evs that derive electricity from multiple sources such as onboard rechargeable electricity storage system ress and a direct continuous connection to landbased generation plants for purposes of onhighway recharging with unrestricted highway range onboard rechargeable electricity storage system and a fueled propulsion power source internal combustion engine plugin hybrid for especially large evs such as submarines the chemical energy of the dieselelectric can be replaced by a nuclear reactor the nuclear reactor usually provides heat which drives a steam turbine which drives a generator which is then fed to the propulsion see nuclear marine propulsion a few experimental vehicles such as some cars and a handful of aircraft use solar panels for electricity onboard storage these systems are powered from an external generator plant nearly always when stationary and then disconnected before motion occurs and the electricity is stored in the vehicle until needed full electric vehicles fev power storage methods include chemical energy stored on the vehicle in onboard batteries battery electric vehicle bev typically with a lithiumion battery kinetic energy storage flywheels static energy stored on the vehicle in onboard electric doublelayer capacitors batteries electric doublelayer capacitors and flywheel energy storage are forms of rechargeable onboard electricity storage systems by avoiding an intermediate mechanical step the energy conversion efficiency can be improved compared to hybrids by avoiding unnecessary energy conversions furthermore electrochemical batteries conversions are reversible allowing electrical energy to be stored in chemical form components the type of battery the type of traction motor and the motor controller design vary according to the size power and proposed application which can be as small as a motorized shopping cart or wheelchair through pedelecs electric motorcycles and scooters neighborhood electric vehicles industrial forklift trucks and including many hybrid vehicles battery an electricvehicle battery evb in addition to the traction battery specialty systems used for industrial or recreational vehicles are batteries used to power the propulsion system of a battery electric vehicle bevs these batteries are usually a secondary rechargeable battery and are typically lithiumion batteries traction batteries specifically designed with a high amperehour capacity are used in forklifts electric golf carts riding floor scrubbers electric motorcycles electric cars trucks vans and other electric vehicles lithiumion battery since their first commercial release in 1991 lithiumion batteries have become an important technology for achieving lowcarbon transportation systems most electric vehicles use lithiumion batteries liions or libs lithiumion batteries have a higher energy density longer life span and higher power density than most other practical batteries complicating factors include safety durability thermal breakdown environmental impact and cost liion batteries should be used within safe temperature and voltage ranges to operate safely and efficiently increasing the batterys lifespan decreases effective costs and environmental impact one technique is to operate a subset of the battery cells at a time and switching these subsets in the past nickelmetal hydride batteries were used in some electric cars such as those made by general motors these battery types are considered outdated due to their tendencies to selfdischarge in the heat furthermore a patent for this type of battery was held by chevron which created a problem for their widespread development these factors coupled with their high cost has led to lithiumion batteries leading as the predominant battery for evs the prices of lithiumion batteries have declined dramatically over the past decade contributing to a reduction in price for electric vehicles but an increase in the price of critical minerals such as lithium from 2021 to the end of 2022 has put pressure on historical battery price decreases electric motor the power of a vehicles electric motor as in other machines is measured in kilowatts kw electric motors can deliver their maximum torque over a wide rpm range this means that the performance of a vehicle with a 100 kw electric motor exceeds that of a vehicle with a 100 kw internal combustion engine which can only deliver its maximum torque within a limited range of engine speed efficiency of charging varies considerably depending on the type of charger and energy is lost during the process of converting the electrical energy to mechanical energy usually direct current dc electricity is fed into a dcac inverter where it is converted to alternating current ac electricity and this ac electricity is connected to a 3phase ac motor for electric trains forklift trucks and some electric cars dc motors are often used in some cases universal motors are used and then ac or dc may be employed in recent production vehicles various motor types have been implemented for instance induction motors within tesla motor vehicles and permanent magnet machines in the nissan leaf and chevrolet bolt energy and motors electric motors are mechanically very simple and often achieve 90 energy conversion efficiency over the full range of speeds and power output and can be precisely controlled motion is provided by a rotary electric motor however it is possible to unroll the motor to drive directly against a special matched track these linear motors are used in maglev trains which float above the rails supported by magnetic levitation this allows for almost no rolling resistance of the vehicle and no mechanical wear and tear of the train or track in addition to the highperformance control systems needed switching and curving of the tracks becomes difficult with linear motors which to date has restricted their operations to highspeed point to point services electric traction allows the use of regenerative braking in which the motors are used as brakes and become generators that transform the motion of usually a train into electrical power that is then fed back into the lines this system is particularly advantageous in mountainous operations as descending vehicles can produce a large portion of the power required for those ascending and in startandstop city use this regenerative system is only viable if the system is large enough to use the power generated by descending vehicles they can be finely controlled and provide high torque from stationarytomoving unlike internal combustion engines and do not need multiple gears to match power curves this removes the need for gearboxes and torque converters evs provide quiet and smooth operation and consequently have less noise and vibration than internal combustion engines while this is a desirable attribute it has also evoked concern that the absence of the usual sounds of an approaching vehicle poses a danger to blind elderly and very young pedestrians to mitigate this situation many countries mandate warning sounds when evs are moving slowly up to a speed when normal motion and rotation road suspension electric motor etc noises become audible electric motors do not require oxygen unlike internal combustion engines this is useful for submarines and for space rovers vehicle types it is generally possible to equip any kind of vehicle with an electric powertrain ground vehicles pureelectric vehicles a pureelectric vehicle or allelectric vehicle is powered exclusively through electric motors the electricity may come from a battery battery electric vehicle solar panel solar vehicle or fuel cell fuel cell vehicle hybrid evs there are different ways that a hybrid electric vehicle can combine the power from an electric motor and the internal combustion engine the most common type is a parallel hybrid that connects the engine and the electric motor to the wheels through mechanical coupling in this scenario the electric motor and the engine can drive the wheels directly series hybrids only use the electric motor to drive the wheels and",
