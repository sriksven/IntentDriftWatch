    "design thinking in visual content how creativity shapes brand perception in a world where consumers scroll through thousands of visuals every single day brands no longer win attention by simply showing a product they win by telling a story communicating purpose and delivering an emotional connection this is where design thinking becomes a strategic force design thinking in visual content goes beyond making something look attractive it is a humancentered creative problemsolving approach that ensures every visual piece aligns with audience expectations brand identity and evolving market behavior for modern businesses pairing design thinking with strong visual storytelling is not just a marketing hack it is how brands become memorable brands today use videos vertical stories animations graphic illustrations and interactive content to communicate but without a clear strategy and empathydriven design approach visuals can easily get lost in the noise this is why many businesses now rely on a creative content studio that understands design thinking deeply they help shape brand perception by crafting visuals that are purposeful consistent and emotionally compelling what is design thinking and why does it matter in visual content design thinking is a structured methodology that focuses on understanding the user first it includes five key stages empathize define ideate prototype and test when applied to visual content this process ensures that every design element communicates meaning colors typography layout imagery style and motion all work together to influence how customers perceive the brand for example a luxury brand must communicate sophistication through minimalistic design richer color tones premium typography and slowmotion visuals on the other hand a youthfocused brand may use bold graphics playful fonts and dynamic motion to transmit energy and fun design thinking ensures these choices are not random but rooted in psychology and user expectations visual content becomes powerful only when it is designed for the audience not just the platform this shift is essential for building brand value and recognition how creativity and design thinking shape brand perception brand perception is simply how people view and feel about a brand visual content plays the biggest role in shaping that perception because humans are highly visual thinkers we form first impressions within seconds based on what we see when a brand invests in an identity built through strategic visuals it achieves three key outcomes 1 stronger emotional resonance 2 clear and consistent communication 3 higher recall value and brand trust creativity fuels uniqueness design thinking ensures that creativity remains relevant together they transform how audiences interpret a brands message a creative content studio helps brands navigate these psychological layers in design they analyze the target audience identify what emotional triggers work best and translate them into visuals that speak louder than words empathy the foundation of effective visual storytelling the most overlooked element in design is empathy understanding audience needs challenges dreams and preferences guides content direction for example a fitness brand may target individuals seeking lifestyle change empathy would guide visuals toward motivating transformations supportive energy and relatable stories rather than extreme intimidating athletic imagery when visuals connect emotionally viewers engage longer they feel understood they remember the brand a creative content studio prioritizes such emotional mapping before producing visuals this ensures the storytelling remains human and authentic design thinking encourages experimentation and originality one major benefit of design thinking is that it allows creative flexibility instead of sticking to oldfashioned repetitive design formats brands can explore fresh methods of storytelling prototyping and testing help refine concepts based on real audience reaction rather than assumptions examples of creative experimentation in visual content include vertical storytelling for mobilefirst attention micro storytelling for shortform content motion graphics for complex message simplification bold typography for direct communication illustration styles that differentiate brand personality creativity differentiates brands in crowded markets when guided by design thinking that creativity becomes strategically impactful building a visual identity that lasts a brands visual identity is not just a logo or color palette it includes every content piece consistently communicating the brands character design thinking helps define these identity rules such as what colors evoke the right emotions what style of imagery reflects the brands voice what layout structure maintains clarity what motion direction aligns with brand tone what typography and spacing communicate correctly when every visual resembles the brands purpose trust increases audiences begin to recognize the brand instantly even without seeing its name a creative content studio plays a crucial role here by maintaining visual consistency across all content platforms visual content as a brand experience every interaction with a brand is an experience visual content defines whether that experience feels premium ordinary or confusing design thinking ensures that the experience is seamless and delightful across touchpoints such as social media stories and feeds websites and landing pages advertisements and campaign banners packaging and offline visuals presentations and brand documents if the user journey is visually cluttered the audience disconnects but when visuals guide them smoothly brand perception improves instantly why brands need a creative content studio to apply design thinking not every business has the time skill or design strategy required to consistently produce highperforming visuals a creative content studio bridges this gap by providing market research and audiencebased insights fresh creative concepts aligned with brand goals a strong visual identity and storytelling structure professional execution across platforms continuous improvement based on testing and analytics they combine creative intuition with usercentered design principles this partnership ensures that visuals are not only beautiful but also purposeful and aligned with business growth future trends whats next for design thinking in content as consumer behavior continues shifting toward visualfirst content design thinking will become even more essential key future trends include aiassisted creative workflows hyperpersonalized content design enhanced motionbased storytelling immersive media such as ar experiences stronger focus on accessibility and inclusivity brands that adopt these innovations early will stay ahead those relying on outdated formats will struggle to grab attention in a rapidly evolving digital world conclusion design thinking is transforming how brands communicate visually it ensures that visuals are meaningful strategic and emotionally engaging rather than just decorative in a time where first impressions form within seconds brands must use visual content wisely to earn recognition trust and loyalty working with a creative content studio gives brands access to the right balance of creativity and problemsolving this leads to a powerful brand perception built through visuals that resonate deeply with audiences when design is centered on humans and storytelling every creative piece becomes an opportunity to strengthen the brand the brands that win today are the ones that craft experiences not just visuals design thinking brings that vision to life shaping how the world sees and remembers a brand",
    "what is asmr understanding the meaning and phenomenon asmr or autonomous sensory meridian response has gained significant popularity in recent years with millions of people tuning in to asmr videos on platforms like youtube twitch and other social media outlets this phenomenon which is characterized by a tingling sensation on the skin particularly around the head neck and sometimes the spine has fascinated researchers enthusiasts and even casual viewers but what exactly is asmr and what is its meaning in this article we will explore the origins science benefits and cultural significance of asmr along with its potential impact on mental health and its growing presence in the digital age what is asmr asmr stands for autonomous sensory meridian response a term that was coined in 2010 by jennifer allen a person who helped to define and describe the experience asmr refers to a physical sensation characterized by a calming tingling feeling that some individuals experience in response to certain visual or auditory stimuli these triggers which can include whispering tapping crinkling or even personal attention are often used in asmr videos to elicit a relaxed and peaceful feeling the sensation itself is often described as a mild staticlike feeling that begins on the scalp and travels down the neck and sometimes to the back and arms for many this sensation is deeply soothing and it is often linked to feelings of relaxation or even sleepiness asmr is considered a unique sensory experience one that is not universally felt by everyone but by those who do experience it it can provide significant relief from stress and anxiety the science behind asmr despite its growing popularity the scientific understanding of asmr remains relatively underexplored researchers are still trying to understand the exact mechanisms of this response however what is clear is that asmr involves a combination of auditory visual and sometimes even tactile stimuli that can produce a distinct physiological reaction in some individuals there are a few theories that attempt to explain the experience of asmr 1 frisson theory some researchers suggest that asmr could be closely related to the experience of frisson which is a sudden wave of pleasure or excitement that often occurs in response to music or a powerful emotional stimulus however unlike frisson which is typically accompanied by an increase in heart rate or arousal asmr tends to produce a relaxing calming effect 2 brain connectivity another theory posits that asmr is related to the brains reward system the experience may involve neural pathways that connect sensory processing areas of the brain to the brains regions responsible for relaxation such as the parasympathetic nervous system these connections may explain why asmr triggers a sense of calm and pleasure 3 endorphins and oxytocin some scientists believe that asmr may stimulate the release of certain neurotransmitters such as endorphins or oxytocin which are associated with relaxation bonding and wellbeing the soothing often intimate nature of many asmr triggers may explain why viewers feel a sense of comfort or connection while the science behind asmr is still developing these hypotheses suggest that asmr could be a unique sensory experience with physiological underpinnings that promote relaxation and reduce stress common asmr triggers asmr is deeply personal and the triggers that elicit the sensation can vary significantly from one individual to another however there are several common triggers that have been found to evoke the asmr response in many viewers 1 whispering one of the most popular and commonly used asmr triggers is whispering soft gentle whispers create a calming and intimate atmosphere mimicking personal attention or close communication for many whispering is one of the most effective ways to trigger the asmr sensation 2 tapping and scratching the sound of tapping or scratching on various surfacessuch as wood plastic or glassoften produces a tingling sensation for asmr enthusiasts the rhythmic repetitive nature of these sounds is believed to be soothing and meditative 3 personal attention videos where the asmrtist the person performing the asmr mimics actions such as roleplaying haircuts doctor visits or even makeup application can trigger asmr the feeling of personal attentioncombined with softspoken words or soundscan lead to relaxation and comfort 4 crinkling and wrinkling the sound of plastic crinkling paper rustling or other similar materials can trigger asmr for some individuals these sounds are often associated with delicate calming actions and are particularly effective when amplified or recorded in highdefinition audio 5 slow movements and visual triggers some people experience asmr when they watch slow deliberate movements such as a hand moving gently over a surface or the visual attention to detail in an asmr video visual triggers can involve watching the asmrtist perform tasks like folding towels or even slow hand movements which can induce a calming almost meditative feeling 6 eating sounds though not universally appreciated some individuals find that the sounds of eatingsuch as chewing sipping or tapping cutlerycan elicit asmr sensations these sounds may evoke memories of soothing social eating experiences helping to create a sense of comfort the benefits of asmr while research is still in its early stages many asmr enthusiasts report a variety of mental and physical benefits associated with the experience these benefits can vary from person to person but generally include 1 stress reduction one of the most widely reported benefits of asmr is its ability to reduce stress the relaxing nature of the tingling sensation combined with soothing sounds can help lower heart rate and promote a calm peaceful state of mind for many watching asmr videos before bed helps to alleviate the pressures of daily life and provides a calming escape 2 improved sleep many people turn to asmr videos as a tool to help them fall asleep the soothing sounds and relaxation often associated with asmr can help individuals ease into sleep particularly those who struggle with insomnia or other sleeprelated issues the calming effects of asmr may be beneficial for people who have difficulty relaxing their minds after a long day 3 alleviation of anxiety and depression some individuals use asmr as a way to manage anxiety or feelings of depression the sense of connection and comfort that asmr triggerscombined with the relaxation it promotescan help soothe anxious thoughts and feelings while asmr is not a substitute for professional treatment it may be a helpful complementary tool for managing symptoms 4 enhanced focus for some asmr can promote a heightened sense of concentration and focus the calming and immersive nature of the experience can create an environment conducive to deep thought or study some people use asmr videos as background noise when they need to concentrate on tasks like reading or writing asmr and mental health asmr has been increasingly discussed in the context of mental health with many people turning to it as a tool for managing emotional wellbeing it is important to note that while asmr can provide relaxation and comfort it is not a replacement for professional therapy or medical intervention when needed however some mental health professionals acknowledge the potential benefits of asmr particularly in relation to stress management relaxation and sleep individuals who experience stress anxiety or insomnia may find asmr to be a valuable noninvasive tool to help alleviate some of their symptoms the role of asmr in the digital age with the rise of asmr videos on platforms like youtube and twitch asmr has become a global phenomenon the accessibility and widespread nature of these videos have allowed people from all over the world to experience and explore asmr at their own pace many asmrtists have garnered large followings offering a variety of content tailored to different tastes and triggers the digital nature of asmr has also created a sense of community for enthusiasts online forums social media groups and dedicated asmr channels allow individuals to share their experiences and connect with others who enjoy the sensation this sense of belonging and shared experience can be comforting for people who may feel isolated or misunderstood in their asmr journey conclusion asmr is a multifaceted and deeply personal phenomenon that has captured the attention of millions of people around the world whether used for stress relief sleep improvement or simply for enjoyment asmr provides a unique sensory experience that can help people relax focus and feel comforted while the science behind asmr is still developing the anecdotal evidence suggests that it has real psychological and physiological benefits asmr has carved out a space for itself in the digital age where its widespread presence on platforms like youtube and twitch allows millions to explore its potential as research into asmr continues to evolve it is likely that we will uncover more about its role in human experience and its broader implications for mental health and wellbeing for those who experience it asmr offers a calming soothing response that provides comfort and peace in an often chaotic world",

    "prisoners of sol 88 first prev android ambassador patreon early access bonus content official subreddit earth space unions alien asset files 1 private capal loading earthtxt to think i was the first vascar to set foot outside of my dimension though everything the nanobots did felt positively horrific experiencing lifes end hadnt been on my bucket list and it was jarring to die and reawaken even afterward the sensation of them beneath my fur was like a billion bugs were infesting it and burrowing into my skin lining not to mention the frightful sensation of them pumping my blood where my heart couldnt in sol they were all that kept my frail organs functioning and my brain was beset by dread however the validation of hearing an elusian praise my findings made it worth it even if it applied the pressure of meeting her standards the stories about corais kind generally suggested it was best to stay out of their way id explained my theory on how human minds pruned data to her velke and dr aguado the elusian had seemed impressed then claimed that her people hadnt managed to figure out the why of their creations abilities in millions of years mikri took a shine to the comparison also enjoying hearing ai terminology used to describe the humans after ficrae nearly shredded us with bullets the nascar vascar seems docile by comparison maybe he can help me understand why the network did nothing to stop his peer from joining the brigands to murder at will i hadnt gotten much of a glimpse at earth yet as takahashi pulled us into a military installationredge had gotten special attention from the diplomats given his high importance i imagined doros had moved on without him but the one thing that might push the girret to reclaim his title was restoring the old human coalition the new technology they had could advance all of us aheadmillennia if not more id been pulled aside for a proper debriefing and explained what happened in caelum after humanitys disappearance my head was swimming when i heard what they had been up to with rogue elusians disagreeing witha future vision that humans were somehow going to result in their nonexistence at any rate corai helmed the group that trained preston and sofia then got a message back in sol through their abandoned other creations the fakra after that they brain transplanted into elusian bodies to infiltrate suam which was invaded by velke once the probe was complete and now there was a war ongoing that humanity had to help in yeah what a clusterfuck im glad we can finally welcome you to our home capal and trust me i wish i didnt have to grovel for your help either way citizenships yoursyou deserve a chance to explore earth and a nice long rest after all youve done youve been through quite the ordeal takahashi sighed but youre also the best of the best humanitys in a spot where theyre both a hairs trigger away from killing us all and theres fuck all we can do so we could use your help sorely i studied the esu general whose eyes and skin remained unaffected by nanobotsfor now you dont have to ask for my help in some capacity but i dont know about building a weapon not my forte i also just got out of being forced to research tech for someone who wanted it for their power to be used for nefarious ends and this time its supposed to genocide an entire race i wont do that i understand believe me this isnt what humans want eitherits our hand thats truly forced not yours i think we have to build something big though to snatch some agency back whatever we make if it can threaten the elusians and the fakra with that my hope is itll serve as a deterrent that threat might make them back off enough that we dont have to use it are you prepared to use it if you have to takahashi barked out a laugh oh without a doubt capal worst case scenario they try to attack sol and were able to choose us over them you have to choose survival when it boils down to it thats just mother natures calling if it makes you feel any better whatever you build would be up to you you could work in a failsafe in fact im counting on you to i shifted uncomfortably not just from the nanobots the prospect of using my knowledge toward an implement of mass destruction displeased me this is alla lot can i have some time to think it over of course you have plenty of catching up left to do with your friends and it may help to hear their perspectives while i cant advise it you might also find your answer talking to velke and better understanding who were dealing with come and find me whenifyoure ready i ambled out of takahashis office with a knot in my throat unable to find any solution to this mess sometimes it felt like i was bouncing from one conscription to another even if i wasnt being forced to help by the humans i knew they were in dire straits and i believed in their cause enough that i wasnt going to sit on the sidelines what was the right decision though what if i played some part in causing the elusians extinction as part of an immutable future this choice could be bringing about the prophecy and i didnt know if i could live with it could you live with not helping leading to the humans being wiped out instead thats a worse burden on my conscience like takahashi said i could try to place restrictions on its usage where other inventors might not you look like someone with a lot on his mind a voice said sitting away from where the others were intermingling trust me its a look ive worn quite often myself ever since the 5d probe i turned my attention in corais direction trying not to show my nervousness im uh sorry for appearing perturbed ill adjust the elusian patted the bench with a gray hand which i waved off remaining standing please no need to fear me ive had to make choices about what ill protect and what matters most to me as well it can be difficult to know whats right when your morals and loyalty are torn in multiple directions er i mumbled hesitating i ddo appreciate you helping the humans ill bite how did you decide corai i thought about which ones i couldnt live without and the emptiness felt more calamitous gaping without the humans to infuse color into my world theyre the victims in all of this dragged into a war when they only sought answers looking inward even i know their hearts are in the right place more than ours theydeserve to survive more than anyone ithink everyone deserves to survive i think its always the little guy getting screwed in every war in every page of history i ventured eyeing her cautiously ha youre forgetting a few pages i remember watching the french revolution with the gratuitous usage of guillotines as their instrument of revolt not too long ago that was hundreds of their cycles ago corai gave me a knowing smile and ive lived millions of years i raise that particular point of human history because i believe thats the fakras intent if its any help you want to know their motivations before you lift a claw might i say its enchanting to have a proper conversation with an organic vascar iyouve been around for basically the entire existence of our species nno wonder elusians dont care about us at all i meanif thats not true why didnt you have a proper conversation before now elusians combed many dimensions looking for any fifthdimensional species like us you werent what we sought we always observed species under our tech level never interacted the justiciarys position is that other races are like beggars staring at riches compared to us that it changes your development to what we can give you that seems to be an extremely jaded position on bringing others forward with you especially when it hardly appears difficult to share the elusian shrugged perhaps did you have any feelings on the vascar at all feelings goodness that is not our style in the slightest youll never meet a more detached people that said i can think of one aspect you might be interested to hear im always interested in any new perspective a refreshing mindset caelums timetable of development mirrored what we planned to engineer for humanity this was slightly before my time but the originators of the sol project handselected the protovascar as peers and set the gap near kalka you were chosen as a temporary counterpart to tide humans over when they took their first steps into dimension travel that phrasing caught my attention to tide humans over im going to need you to spell that out for me i mean that you were excellent candidates to evolve on a similar timeline but also to still give the humans the ultimate control over how to handle you if they sought friendship it was theirs to find if they sought conquest it was theirs to take we wouldnt interfere it would speak volumes about our creations intent corai spoke in such a nonchalant voice as if everything she said about the elusians choices made perfect sense my species was insignificant altogether to their aims those godlike figures didnt care if we lived or died the spirit of altruism seemed entirely lost on them not bothering to help anyone they deemed beneath them i didnt think much of my people but we deserved more than being set aside as human playthings with the fakra receiving that same attitude i could see why they attacked suam you wouldve just let them kill us all what about our species right to exist i exclaimed corai pursed her lips a test must permit free will the story of what happened between us and humanity really didnt involve you except that they made it so to them you still matter even though elusians never gave you a solitary thought including you personally i am trying to see what they see and love what they love its not easy my point is that you should be grateful that despite our shared ancestry they turned out so much better i see now you understand us as we arethe side of us that shames me so i hope it brings some surety to your decision i imagine you feel trivialized capal and rightfully so i encourage you to move on to someone more worthy of your time go be with the ones whove missed you so thoroughly i turned away from the elusian and strolled off in a stupor before pausing and glancing over my shoulder one last thing preston really a fullfledged smile spread across her face for the first time in the conversation as she laughed really what do you see in him corais smile leveled out and her eyes grew serious he retains and spreads his joy even after everything hes been through he reminded me how to laugh and to love no matter what challenges preston he makes sure to change how we all look at the world and give us that moment of positivity to latch on to not to mention that hed do anything for those he cares about i find who he is to be admirable huh i never thought of it that way preston has had a rough go of it dont hurt him dont worry capal the ways ill hurt him i think hell quite enjoy i i felt my cheek fur rising with embarrassment and i stumbled backward while looking at the floor i have to go busy social calendar the elusian winked i guess you should be off then oh mikri was looking for you thanks ill go find him i cleared my throat and scurried off finding the inorganic vascars chassis with relative ease id grown a lot more fond of him than i wouldve expected back when we first met procuring an artificialfurred mane for him hadnt been in mind for our friendships trajectory after seeing how ficrae relished violence and turned on us i couldnt see mikri as a heartless silversheen even knowing what hed once planned in the past when id sent the robot off down the tunnel i hadnt known that id no longer have his aid at winning over the network i wasnt eager to get back to that mission after how our last attempt had ended but it was important to get a feel for whether that was even possible if i was going to build some sort of superweapon for humanity the androids help would be not just invaluable but necessary with any luck mikri would have a better plan than i did right now first prev android ambassador patreon early access bonus content official subreddit",

    "unrequited romantic feelings in new connection feeling jealous sad and confused in february i 29 f started dating sam 34 m i have a few years of experience and a long term primary partner who is long distance but sam is starting to explore nonmonogamy this year and he is dating multiple people and has no rush to define those relationships there is this one girl who he met before we did she lives in argentina and he is very excited about her and hes had plans ever since we met to spend a month with her in november in buenos aires the thing is my relationship with sam has grown a lot over this period we live two hours away from each other and have similar schedules so weve been seeing each other about once a month for days together and that has slowly grown in frequency and duration so in september i went on vacation for 4 days with sam and his best friend best friends girlfriend and he did a day trip to see me in october he did 4 days at my place and then an overnight visit before leaving for argentina we text each other every day and sometimes call sam has become one of the people i call when something important happens and ive started to fall in love with him the thing is right before he left for argentina we had a conversation about how we wanted to call each other if we linked our profiles on feeld i said i would be happy with partners and sam said he wouldnt be comfortable with that he told me he has a lot of love for me that he has a strong emotional and sexual bond but that hes not in love we have discussed this more and he has said that he just doesnt sigh for me but everything else is there but he still doesnt see the relationship as having a strong romantic component i am crushed because i thought this was mutual and i feel really sad that hes not down to acknowledge a part of our relationship that had felt very real for me up to that point he says he doesnt need the chemical feelings of being in love to want to see me and to enjoy time with me but apparently that means he also doesnt see me as a partner we have built a routine and intimacy that for me feels way beyond friends with benefits though i dont want our relationship to change i dont want to hop on the relationship escalator with him either but i do want to feel seen and recognized symbolically as a relationship that is special and different from friendship i dont really know what to do because i dont want to throw away the complicy and love we have for each other just because his feelings dont adapt to my desires and expectations however now that hes gone to argentina with someone who he is very much in love with im struggling a lot with jealousy i think it would be easier if i could fall back on knowing he loves me too or ask for the kind of care i share with a partner in these type of moments but ever since i found out about his lack of romantic feelings i feel invalidated in seeking reassurance our texting and communication has obviously changed since his being away and im feeling abandoned though i know its just for the month i guess my question is how have you handled situations like these where there is a mismatch in feelings but all the other desires fit together we are well aligned in sexuality expectations for shared spaces frequency emotional intimacy etc and it pains me to think i might have to give up all those things because my romantic feelings are so strong and i cant deny there is a lot of pain around them not being reciprocated by sam",
    "mega detention centers ice considers buying large warehouses to hold immigrants the trump administration is exploring a plan to buy warehouses designed for companies like amazon sources said which would drastically increase the trump administrations capacity for detaining immigrants the trump administration is exploring buying warehouses that were designed for clients like amazon and retrofitting them as detention facilities for immigrants before they are deported a move that would vastly expand the governments detention capacity according to a homeland security department official and a white house official the precise warehouses that immigration and customs enforcement may buy have not yet been determined but the agency is looking at locations in the southern us near airports where immigrants are most often deported the dhs official and the white house official said selecting such warehouses would increase efficiency in deportations the dhs official said a deal to purchase the warehouses which on average are more than twice the size of current ice detention facilities is past the early stages but not yet final the dhs official and the white house official said the dhs official described the warehouses as future mega detention centers amazon would not be a part of any deal and would not profit from it as the warehouses were built by developers for amazon but never used or leased by the company the officials said an amazon spokesperson said that the company is not involved in any discussions with dhs or ice about warehouse space and that it leases and does not own the vast majority of its warehouse space it was not immediately clear who owns the warehouses that the government may buy and the dhs official and the white house official did not know how much the deals could be worth the dhs official said some of the warehouses under consideration were built by developers with amazon in mind but never used any decision on whether to use such warehouses or how many has not yet been finalized the dhs official said the white house referred all questions on the matter to dhs and ice dhs and ice did not respond to comment purchasing large warehouses would be the latest in a series of unconventional and at times contentious ideas in the trump administrations search for immigrant detention space the plans underscore ices ambitions to ramp up its detainment of immigrants on a large scale ice has struggled to hit daily arrest quotas and fill hiring goals and some of its senior leaders are being replaced amid white house frustrations amazon warehouses range in size averaging approximately 800000 square feet the largest is in wilmington delaware at 38 million square feet by comparison an ice detention facility in tacoma washington houses 1500 immigrants in 277000 square feet the white house official said ice would pay for the warehouses with funds from the budget reconciliation package that president donald trump signed earlier this year and calls the one big beautiful bill the warehouses would be owned by ice outright and not contracted through the private prison industry or states as is the case with other facilities the dhs official and the white house official said if the purchases are finalized the idea is for ice to convert the warehouses into detention facilities and likely run them with its own employees not contractors or military personnel the dhs official and the white house official said prior to the current administration most ice detention facilities were run by private prison contractors that both owned and staffed the building with federal funding an nbc news poll released earlier this month noted that 51 of voters said the trump administration has lived up to their expectations on border security and immigration while 44 said it fell short of their expectations in addition 39 of registered voters said they view ice favorably while 50 said they view it unfavorably a pew research center survey from this summer noted the trump administrations overall approach to immigration is viewed more negatively than positively with 42 approving and 47 disapproving adding the sentiment was largely split along party lines since trump retook office in january after campaigning on a promise of mass deportations of immigrants his administration has tried different approaches to detention facilities with varied success trump charged the military earlier this year with holding immigrants in tents at the us naval base in guantanamo bay cuba but the plan to hold tens of thousands of immigrants there did not materialize the administration next turned to large scale detention of immigrants in tents in fort bliss texas that effort hit hurdles during contracting and construction but now houses over 2000 immigrants the administration also recently announced more staterun immigrant detention facilities in florida louisiana and indiana",
    "feeling guilty and ashamed after my first alcohol and sex hi reddit wasnt sure how to get by but i 23 f am making this post to let go of some heaviness i am experiencing in my chest and i could appreciate some reality checks or ways to cope almost 2 weeks ago i met this amazing person lets call him shawn im an international student and moved to the new country for my studies almost a month ago i didnt realize that i would still be having my hinge on my phone from back home to here mostly forgot about it but i noticed that it was still active and decided to give it a try again out of sheer curiosity at my new location thats where i met shawn and we immediately clicked for most part i liked our conversations he was very mature kind and communicative i have never dated before this cultural plus commitment reasons so i was not sure what i was getting myself into i was naive for most of the part and we had an age difference of 14 years few dates in and i knew id like to spend more time with him to a point where i started weaving the whole future earlier i was adamant about the thought of finding the love of my life get married and then become physical but shawn changed my perspective for good and told me how it is important to have a pace and explore our own rhythms and pleasures it was dreamy and perfect i didnt want to hide anything so i was pretty transparent about my mental health issues i was diagnosed with clinical bpd and dysthymia almost a year ago and been on therapy and meds since continued with them till the point where i got to know about moving got busy hopeless and eventually stopped it was not something i dumped but something he asked so it naturally came along throughout our conversation i had childhood trauma baggage which was another primary reason why i decided to move out of my somewhat toxic house and take the bold step of moving continents and living alone shawn listened to me and was pretty much understanding about the whole thing initially i was at so much comfort and tried to do everything right so we never had to struggle with it i tried but i know words are not enough for assurance and bpd has a bad rep already have a past of people demonising me as soon as i told them that i have had it he even has a son and shared how one of his exes had abandonment issues that ruined him so he is trying to be careful with whom he chooses next not just for himself but also his child to not go through the loss again i understand the pain from a 4 years old perspective because i wouldnt have wanted that for myself either spending these days was one of the best times of my life we talked on so many interesting subjects i was not rushing but was excited with the thought of finally feeling belonged and maybe having a tiny family of my own tbh i am not used to share this side to many and i am scared of the idea of traumadumping on someone being a people pleaser and unlearning it made me realize that i need to have empathy to an extreme and listen to everyone instead of crying about my pain thats when i did the most stupid mistake of my life i decided to try alcohol for the first time and having sex i am still extremely guilty and shameful about it in that moment it just felt right and good in that space i felt like i was finally free and in a safe hands with him we became intimate and i am not going to lie when i say that it was perfect he was gentle and kind however the alcohol part is what ruined it for us as soon as i tried it i blacked out and dont remember most of the night next day when i woke up feeling embarrassed and sane i finally asked him if i have done something wrong and thats when he told me that i have slipped out about my past when i was heavily drunk it was about how i tried to off myself when i was 7 and i still wish if i couldve been successful that broke me i was ashamed and i didnt mean to ever tell that to him at least not at this stage i might say i may feel very intense psychological pain once in a while but coming here was doing enough healing thats when things went completely off the rails for both of us and this morning he texted me that he cant do this anymore and i shouldnt try to contact him again i am clueless guilty and ashamed i should have just focused on college instead i indulged into these impulsive thoughts i feel dirty and somewhat embarrassed about the whole situation has anyone else gone through this what advice would you give if it was not love yet why does it hurt like one i am trying to reason with the current situation by myself and wished him the best at the end i am thinking of starting with therapy again so let us see how that goes thanks for reading",
    "on behaviour a sentiment i see often within varying spiritual circles and especially within acim related spaces is the idea that behaviour doesnt matter because the course is entirely about content while behaviour is form while this sentiment is not wrong it does miss the point and often leads to easier egojustification of what otherwise would be easily seen as nonsensical the reason behaviour is said to not matter within acim is because that it the wrong approach to take behaviour is a symptom in form not the cause much like treating an infected wound with a bandage only covers the wound but does not remove the infection attempting to adjust ones mind through asceticism self discipline etc will not have the same effect as actual mind training this is apparent with how the course approaches its methodology however there is a big unspoken consequence here if you are actually undergoing the mind training earnestly and your mental patterns are indeed shifting your behaviour will change accordingly without effort behaviour is automatic it is the result of your mental will and intent so for someone to say oh acim wont change your day to day life you will just forgive your existing errors is fundamentally wrong an misconstruing what the course teaches forgiving your own errors is what leads to the errors no longer being repeated through pattern reassociation away from the ego and towards the holy spirit as your thought system this is not meant as an admonishment there still is not sin however if you perceive yourself as addicted to certain behaviours substances patterns etc etc it is a road sign on your journey showing you that hey you havent actually integrated the lesson yet personally along my journey and learnings ive noticed this extremely overtly i used to struggle with addiction to nicotine weed and porn many times i attempted to quit for various reasons using various methods and none worked they were all simply a form of attempting to punish sin which must fail because it begins incorrectly and tries to make illusion truth however as i went further along my path of spiritual growth including the acim workbook i dropped all of these addictions with relative ease i did not intend to drop them using acim nor did i try to drop them through effort but as my thought system began to shift they simply fell away as behavioural symptoms of a sick mind your behaviours are defined by your thought system of choice the thought system in acim does not aim at altering behaviour as the method of healing but it will do so via adjusting the underlying patterns that make behaviours if your behaviours are not shifting as a result of thought system change i would invite you to look within honestly with the holy spirit on what parts of the ego thought system you still hold onto to justify that if you believe the end result of the acim workbook and grasping the message of the text is living the exact same life but going around saying you are forgiven for what you did not do constantly i would invite you to explore what resistance you have at the deeper levels integrating the thought system of the holy spirit if you recode a computer program do you expect it to run the same output none of this is meant as a judgement and none of it should be used as a judgement it can only be used as something to bring to the holy spirit for him to judge we still cannot correct each others errors i cannot correct yours as that would attempt to make them real and that is not my intent with this post my intent is simply to share my own experience in how many of my errors truly were corrected and hope that someone receives useful insight into what they themselves are experiencing for the purposes of healing no course student is better or worse because of their behaviours simply remember that behaviours can be part of the feedback on your own learning progress",

reported by civilian scientific authorities all points seen represent starsgalaxies in front of the anomaly item scp3200 object class keter special containment procedures at present primary containment procedures consist of exploring ways to slow down the expansion of scp3200 all potential research inquiries along this line are open for consideration as no current solution permanent or temporary has been found foundation affiliated researchers have been suitably implanted into civilian scientific institutions in order to both discourage serious inquiry into the nature of scp3200 while also conducting independent research into the anomaly rescue attempts for the crewmembers of the peregrine9 expedition are not being considered at this time description scp3200 is a region of space currently 300 million light years in diameter located at approximately right ascension 14h 50m and declination 46 commonly referred to as the botes void by civilian scientists at present the exact properties of scp3200 are unknown as most research into the anomaly was conducted by the now defunct peregrine expedition program as such there is considerable debate into how exactly scp3200 functions though the following principles are considered to be accurate by majority consensus scp3200 represents an exceptionally thin and potentially open region of spacetime such that transuniversal contact is possible through scp3200 the anomaly is expanding at a rate of 1 million light years per year the expansion of scp3200 poses a nonzero threat of a ukclass universal collapse scenario all other points concerning the exact properties of scp3200 are considered to be highly speculative researchers looking for more information concerning the anomaly may consult the following compiled reports on scp3200 history of the anomaly the anomaly was first discovered by civilian scientists who noted that the region of space possessed significantly fewer galaxies than one would expect from any other region of space notably while a similar size region of space should contain 2000 galaxies scp3200 only possesses 60 foundation researchers at site 118 conducting research into extrasolar anomalies noted extremely high hume levels arising from scp3200 but were unable to determine any reason for this continued research into scp3200 would not be seriously conducted until the launch of the peregrine expeditions in 2008 original peregrine expedition mission statement with the creation of eversophisticated technology by members of our applied sciences divisions we often find uses for various advances that we had never before considered the creation of the first temporal sinks by foundation researchers showed us that time can be manipulated slowed down or even held constant from the perspectives of different viewers as such we aim to use modified temporal sink devices in the launch of a new foundation space initiative in order to better understand nonterrestrial anomalies by speeding up time relative to us on earth for the crewmembers of our planned spacecraft we can accomplish advanced space travel to many distant locations temporal sinks allow us to maintain the natural flow of time for both us observers on earth and the crewmembers of the expedition maintaining causality in all frames of reference it is a simple matter of cryogenically freezing our crewmembers for however long they intend to travel activating our modified temporal sinks and then waking them up when they arrive at their destination in a frame of time that is usable by our standards all without violating causality small scale tests indicate that we could use these temporal sinks aboard fuelefficient ion thruster powered spacecraft to send researchers hundreds of million of light years away and back in the space of a few months allowing us to vastly improve our knowledge of extrasolar anomalies dr aleksey dimitrov the approval of this experimental technology in order to study extrasolar anomalies led to the launch of the peregrine expeditions in order to glean more data on several different extrasolar anomalies scp3200 was selected as the target of the peregrine9 expedition launched november 29th 2010 peregrine9 expedition details objective conduct research into the nature of scp3200 and ascertain origins of abnormally high hume levels crewmembers mission commanderpilot captain mikhail kuznetsov mechanical engineer researcher alexander moreau astrophysicist and researcher thomas sewell extrasolar containment specialist flight details mission will take place from 112910 to 112916 flight time using temporal sinks will occupy roughly 4 years of total mission time during which crewmembers will be cryogenically frozen on 22816 the foundation recovered a capsule launched by peregrine9 consisting of modified segments of the original peregrine9 shuttle the following is a collection of relevant logs and transcripts found inside the capsule full reports may be retrieved pending approval from the project director recorded date 2113 camera feed begins kuznetsov is seen adjusting the camera as the rest of the crew seems to have only just awoken from cryosleep moreau and just like that were 700 million light years from home didnt feel like anything to me sewell its a little scary and a little amazing so this means that were firmly inside the anomaly then kuznetsov correct i dont feel anything different though moreau take a look outside moreau takes the camera and shows the view outside the spacecraft it is pitch black with no signs of any stars or galaxies visible moreau now thats disturbing pure blackness all three men are silent sewell what do you suppose is out there kuznetsov who knows its our job to figure it out camera feed ends recorded date 2213 camera feed begins kuznetsov is seen sitting in front of the camera kuznetsov this is captain mikhail kuznetsov of the peregrine9 mission reporting in on day 1 of the mission which has already hit a snag the first thing we tried to do was to verify the anomalous hume levels that our more earthbound satellites were able to pick up but our kant counters dont seem to be functioning properly here the hume levels were reading are fluctuating rapidly anywhere from almost 0 to absurd numbers in the hundreds if we came all the way here only to have faulty kant countersheh what a tragedy thatd be kuznetsov is seen pausing and then looking out the viewport kuznetsov still there seems to be somethingoff about this place well have to do more research later thats all for today i suppose camera feed ends recorded date 31313 camera feed begins all three crewmembers are seen surrounding what appears to be a box of some kind kuznetsov is seen directly facing the camera kuznetsov so today we woke up and saw a box outside moreau floating around in the middle of space nowhere just sitting pretty kuznetsov we just recovered the object and are about to open it nobody panic alright nervous chuckles from the group kuznetsov stands off to the side by the ejection port moreau lifts the hatch on the box carefully and looks inside moreau its acd should we run it kuznetsov go ahead use the isolated computer its not connected to anything moreau runs the cd which opens up a film on the computer following a nod from kuznetsov he plays it the film shows a view of captain kuznetsov sitting in front of a camera kuznetsov what the hell filmkuznetsov this is captain mikhail kuznetsov of the peregrine9 mission reporting in on day 35 still no signs of slowing down the anomalys growth we cant get any good data on it either because we still cant get any of our counters working still we will see what we can dofor the good of us all signing off the film ends by this point camera feed ends recorded date 32113 camera feed begins kuznetsov is seen in front of the camera again kuznetsov this is captain mikhail kuznetsov of the peregrine9 mission reporting in on day 47 of the mission over the past week or so weve picked up about 12 more recordings of me speaking about the anomaly in question kuznetsov sighs and is seen rubbing his neck kuznetsov were still not any closer to answers though all of these other versions of myself seem to know more about whats going on than i do since they all reference stopping scp3200 wish this version of me could know half as much as they seem toheh which reminds me no the kant counters still dont work still not sure why kuznetsov leans back and rubs his face kuznetsov moreau thinks that were seeing something from other universes which would explain where these things are coming from thomas believes that something is off about the reality surrounding this anomaly which would explain the malfunctioning kant counters but we have no idea why that is either in summary we have a whole lot of nothing and a lot of questions thats all for today camera feed ends recorded date 8613 camera feed begins kuznetsov is seen with his head in his hands he looks up at the camera kuznetsov today marked the 38th tape weve recovered of myself weve gotten 38 different capsules containing tapes of myself speaking to a camera just like im doing now and none of them are exactly the same in each video im wearing different clothes the date is off i have different hair all kinds of things and ive got no damn idea why kuznetsov leans into the camera kuznetsov what worries me the most is that we still havent found out any details about what exactly scp3200 is doing were pretty sure that this is a region of some weird spacetime stuff moreau is adamant that this is a region where spacetime is pretty thin allowing for contact between universes but beyond that we just dont know exactly whats happening worse weve started finding more than capsulesthings like bodies mine sewells moreaus and some of people that ive never seen parts of shuttles using technology that i havent seen before and other scraps of things that i dont understand at all kuznetsov shudders kuznetsov there is something deeply wrong about this place it feels fundamentally misplaced that it doesnt belong i dont know what else we can find here signing off for today camera feed ends the following was written in captain kuznetsovs personal notes regarding the mission on 82113 how many times how many times have we been here this is the question that keeps me up at night the question that has brought me no rest we are certainly not the first and every other kuznetsov out there seems to have been brought low by this same question we recovered a log today the man that i saw on that tape was old very old he had been recording the anomaly for a long time years perhaps even decades thousands of tapes recovered no answers he had studied it for years and years and nowhere did he find an answer to why this was happening they say that the definition of madness is doing the same thing over and over again but expecting different results if so then just how mad are we on 9713 captain kuznetsov apparently vanished while attempting to retrieve another tape he reappeared two days later on 9913 extremely dehydrated and weak the other crewmembers report that kuznetsov recorded this message shortly before lapsing into a coma we were fools the void isnt a region where spacetime is ruined its the source of the tear itself spacetime itself is rending itself apart and were seeing echoes of every timeline in the past and future time is an ouroboros devouring itself again and again only to be reborn i saw all of it all of the times we tried to stop it in the past all the times that i tried to stop it in the past and the future this happens again and again until we get it right over and over again we try and try to fix it all times blend together until we reach singularity and all is lost the tear opens more holes everywhere in reality and the anomalies appear faster and faster but containment is only delaying the inevitable the inevitable cleansing of the slate i saw all the timelines and we havent stopped it in any of them mater bozhya1javascript we have seen into the abyss and by god it hates us this was the last recorded event that was stored

    "from thought to form part 4 the anatomy of a clear intention to manifest with precision your intention needs to speak the universes language clear confident and embodied heres how to craft it so it actually takes shape 1 be exact not vague general wishes blur your signal instead of i want more money tell creation exactly what that looks like im bringing in 5000 every month through my business endeavors give your energy a clear destination the universe cant deliver what you havent defined 2 root it in the present dont cast your desire into the future it keeps it there speak it like its already unfolding i am living in my dream home surrounded by beauty and peace presenttense language anchors your vibration in the now the only place creation actually happens 3 charge it with emotion energy responds to feeling before your intention can exist in form it must exist in frequency ask yourself what would i feel if this were already mine then start embodying that emotion in small real ways your feelings are the current that carries your intention from thought to reality the goal is to feel it and then let it go science and magick go hand in hand magick and science are often painted as opposites but theyre really two sides of the same current science dissects the mechanics how energy behaves how cause creates effect how matter responds to intention in measurable ways magick on the other hand explores the consciousness behind those mechanics the why that moves the how its the study of meaning emotion and belief as energetic forces capable of shaping reality science observes external phenomena but magick deals with the internal architecture of creation science might call it neuroplasticity magick calls it alchemy of the mind when you repeat affirmations visualize outcomes or engage in ritual youre literally restructuring neural pathways youre instructing your subconscious to perceive and respond differently turning metaphysical intent into tangible chemistry where science tracks patterns in the physical world magick works through resonance both rely on laws of energy and vibration just viewed from different vantage points science measures the ripples magick teaches you how to make them together they form a complete language of creation one that acknowledges both the machinery of the universe and the spirit that animates it take love spells for example you cant attract love from a place of emptiness the spell itself isnt what makes someone love you its the mirror reflecting what you believe you deserve if you dont love yourself your energy will keep reinforcing lack no matter how many candles you light this is where real magick meets psychology you cant just cast a spell for confidence beauty or love and expect it to rewrite your reality while you keep the same thought patterns you have to retrain your mind to match the energy youre invoking that means daily work rituals that intentionally reprogram the way you think feel and act for instance standing in front of a mirror locking eyes with yourself and speaking affirmations until you believe them isnt just spiritual its neurological youre rewiring pathways teaching your brain that you are already enough you dont need to call yourself a witch to work magick just as you dont need to understand quantum physics for gravity to work spirit is already a part of you woven into every thought breath and heartbeat whether or not you acknowledge it you are the spell visualization and the power of alignment visualization is more than just daydreaming its energetic rehearsal when you vividly imagine your desired reality as if its already happening youre teaching your brain and body what alignment feels like every sensory detail what you see hear feel and even smell tells your nervous system this is real the more familiar that version of reality becomes the easier it is for your subconscious to navigate toward it over time what was once a fantasy begins to feel natural believable and eventually inevitable intention vs expectation one of the most common blocks in manifestation is confusing pure intention with rigid expectation expectation tries to control intention creates space when you grip too tightly insisting that your desire must appear in a certain way or on a certain timeline you strangle the flow that could actually bring it to you that tension lowers your vibration signaling resistance instead of trust true intention doesnt force it invites its steady in its vision but open in its outcome you can declare i intend to attract a career that fulfills me without demanding it come through a specific company title or timeline that flexibility allows the universe to orchestrate the path that aligns best with your energy intention says this is my direction expectation says it must happen my way the first builds momentum the second builds walls when you release control you open the door for something even greater to unfold the universe often works beyond logic weaving paths you could never plan set your direction with clarity then loosen your grip trust that whats meant for you will find its way without being forced when you stop fixating on how it happens you give your energy the freedom to flow where its most aligned everything in existence is in motion energy never stands still and neither do you every thought experience and realization shapes who youre becoming change isnt something to resist its the pulse of creation itself the more you grow the more your desires will shift to match your evolving frequency thats why your intentions should breathe with you revisit them often sit with your desires and ask does this still reflect where im going allow what no longer fits to fall away and welcome new visions that speak to who you are now the key is to stay open to move with change rather than clinging to what once was growth requires motion and motion is how you stay in harmony with the universes rhythm if you want your manifestation to hold let your everyday life start mirroring it dont just think the vision start living in its outline rearrange your space so it feels like a place that version of you would wake up in maybe that means adding warm lighting clearing clutter or keeping fresh flowers by your bed because they make you feel grounded and intentional your habits are energy too what does the version of you that youre stepping into listen to pay attention to the lyrics songs plant thoughts and thoughts shape your frequency how do they wear their hair how do they move through their morning rushed or intentional how do they treat other people even in passing every small act becomes a rehearsal for the reality youre building you dont need to spend a fortune to embody that version of you curate what feels aligned maybe its switching up your wardrobe experimenting with your style or learning how to take better care of yourself i am not saying go out and buy the most expensive things buy less choose with purpose when everything you do starts reflecting the energy of your intention you stop wishing for it and you start living it thats what true manifestation is youre not asking or forcing youre aligning youre saying this is who i am now remember intention is only the beginning it is the spark that sends a message through the unseen once its released your energy becomes the signal that keeps it alive faith turns that spark into momentum focus gives it shape patience allows it to breathe and the steps you take each day are what weave it into form intention lights the path but its how you walk it that invites the universe to respond in my next post well explore the next step perception how what you accept as truth quietly sculpts the way you see think and move through the world because the moment you understand the power behind what you believe you start realizing how much of your reality was never fixed it was simply waiting for you to see it differently",

    "yep alright there it is i wish i was born a woman what do i do its all ive been able to think about for a while now am i a fake because its taken me about 26 years to realize this i hid a lot of my identity for so long because i didnt feel like i should be allowed to be happy but im finally getting in a better head space and exploring my identity and i realize exactly how unhappy ive been it hurts so much when i think about all the time ive wasted please help",
    "feeling like my therapist is frustrated and done with mewould really appreciate some perspective and opinions did i mess it all up beyond repair this is a long post ah i cant seem to help that its always long i have added tldr and have listed the questions at the end tldr therapist seems emotionally withdrawn after i repeatedly failed to follow through with tasks hes now being more firm and less emotional focusing on action over discussion i understand why but its making me feel ashamed like ive ruined the relationship or become the lazy client hes frustrated with im planning to stop talkingsharing too much and just follow instructions and do tasks for now but part of me worries ill lose what therapy used to be hi ive been in therapy for about 3 months recently things have been difficult and started feeling really off between me and my therapist and i dont know how to handle it or if im just overthinking during our last session he seemed frustrated he said i keep repeating the same things and not following through that i avoid make excuses and dont take accountability that instead of trying things thats told i resist solutions and so much time goes in convincing me to do things he reminded me that its my responsibility to make changes not his job to come up with solutions or fix things for me i get what hes saying hes right i am slow inconsistent and often stuck in the same patterns i do try but i havent been able to keep it up ive been feeling so emotionally drained and exhausted lately that even small tasks or chores feel overwhelming i think from last 2 weeks i havent done things that i told i would try so that is coming off as me not respecting or taking things seriously ig i told him that pushing myself nonstop has started feeling pointless like i dont even get satisfaction from finishing things anymore and told that from past few weeks ive been trying to just get things done irrespective of feeling low or drained etc but now i am exhausted with that too and not able to push myself he saw that as more avoidance and said that everyone does uncomfortable things and i need to stop expecting everything to feel good he also asked since psychiatrist has now restarted one of the meds temporarily to help me why am i still not doing things hes right but i felt like whatever i tried to tell or explain it all just came across as laziness or excusemaking i hate that i am being this way now and ashamed of it he also told coming frequently wont help unless i do things and i am making him repeat things and wasting time again i know he is right but yeah it does hurt a little even knowing he is right and trying to help and i need to move and do things instead of talking ive also been struggling at work dreading it with no apparent reason taking leaves not wanting to do tasks feeling like ive become lazy when i tried to talk about whether this job or project even fits me anymore he cut it short and said something like i dont know why were even discussing this when you havent done the simple tasks i asked that really hit me i understand where hes coming frommaybe it was bad timing without doing chores talking more but it also made me feel like unless im performing and doing all the tasks perfectly im not allowed to explore how i actually feel about things i wasnt trying to avoid responsibility i really wanted to figure out whats going on with me but maybe i brought it up at the wrong time he also said not everything in life will make me happy that most people just push through jobs they dont love thats normal not everything needs to give happiness or satisfaction he also asked doesnt paycheck that you get at the end of month not matter to you does it not mean anything paycheck will help you do other things that you want to do i tried to explain that i understand life cant be about only happy things always but since work is a major part of my life and i used to get satisfaction from it even if i was pushing too hard and tired now that i am no longer getting that i wanted to explore or just discuss like if something that is a huge part of life is no longer giving satisfaction and not much else makes me happy too what is the use of living while ik it all cant be about happiness i think its very different when most part of life feels meaningless he also asked whether id prefer being in a place like a facility where people make me do things and take care of me idk if he meant it hypothetically to kind of jolt me into doing things especially since he feels i am not taking things seriously but it scared me it felt like maybe he thinks im too far gone or incapable of doing things on my own ive started feeling like my emotions are too much or not useful like i should stop explaining stop sharing too much and just do whats asked keep it factual not bring up how i feel unless he directly asks i understand the logic of just do it but its hard and i think i have been speaking a lot and being too open thereby oversharing and wasting time usually i evaluate and respond and behave accordingly people pleasing ig but in therapy i havent done that consciously i tried to be as open and honest as possible instead of telling or doing right thing just told or done things without that filter but yeah thats not how it works being honest and open doesnt mean being pathetic and lazy and giving excusesi need to be more responsible and talk a bit less especially since i tend to give too many details or the way i talk is like in streams instead of clear concise to the point stuffwhich tends to take more time and not efficient i feel like a broken recordalways saying ill try harder and then failing it feels more bad because for yearsmost of my life i have been able to push myself and do thingsthats how i have always been now i am not able to and idk why and i am disappointing everyone who is trying to help me or care for me and i have always been lazy with stuff and put things off till last minute but i have been able to somehow manage and do well and not get into trouble or face consequences etc somehow ive managed but now thats also not happeningeven imagining consequences isnt helping me push myself like before one thing i keep wondering is what is considered slow progress i feel like i have made some progress for example handling things i was scared of before traveling alone many small things like that but since ive been struggling with following through on certain tasks recently it feels like none of that counts anymore and i am stuck and useless does that mean all my other improvements are meaningless until i fix this one area basically i dont know if im genuinely stuck or have become too lazyidk if hes lost patience with me and it is now completely beyond repair and im scared of bringing this up directly because i dont want it to sound like im blaming him or making excuses again especially since i know he is right and can understand where he is coming from right now it feels like sharing my thoughts or feelings only frustrates him or makes me seem lazy and avoidant but at the same time im scared that if i shut down completely i will lose the only space i thought i could be honesti just feel like ive crossed a line and disappointed him too much or tested his patience too much without meaning to questions 1 is it normal for a therapist to become more distant and blunt after a few months when progress slows 2 does this sound like a normal phase or rupture in therapy can it be repaired 3 do therapists often lose patience or see clients who are lazy as beyond help 4 am i overreacting misreading his frustration or do therapists really get emotionally done with clients sometimes 5 is there any way to repair this kind of rupture if ive made him lose faith in me i know one thing can be to just get done with the task he told and i am doing it and will be done before next session but yeah anything else 6 is shifting focus to just completing tasks and keep things short and factual focused on tasks and saving emotional material for only when asked a reasonable temporary strategy or will hiding emotions slow true healing and damage the relationship 7 how do i balance doing whats asked actions discipline with still being honest about how i feel without it sounding like excuses or wasting time 8 i wrote a suicide note during a low moment after last session but didnt act did contemplate ways search about things did go to terrace to jump but yeah someone else came and i didnt ig even if no one had come ultimately i wouldnt have jumped should i tell my therapist about that or will it likely be taken as attentionseeking cause for referral to higher care both psychiatrist and therapist know about my passive si thoughts and until now psychiatrist has been very confident that i actually wont go through with it and those thoughts are just my response to stress ps idk if i have conveyed things properly here or missed some context that might make things seem different than what they are also not sure if im looking at things wrongly just wanted some advice and opinions as i feel really bad about how i have been recently and want to fix it thank you if read all this and decided to reply",

provisional containment wing of site42 research into scp2820s origins and methods of destroying it are underway description scp2820 is a directedenergy weapon operated by a modified prometheus labs artificial intelligence designated as kalki the main body of the weapon resembles a multistage coilgun mortar however a satellite dish with an antenna has been mounted to the front and the rear has been modified to fit a large semispherical apparatus attempts to open the apparatus have been unsuccessful mounted on the back of this apparatus is a monitor and terminal the ai is able to receive and can respond to user input through the terminal the monitor continually displays realtime satellite footage of a random person the target somewhere in the world all of whom have been found to be anomalous in some way scp2820 eliminates its targets through a highly convoluted sequence of apparently unrelated events at least once every twentyfour hours the monitor will display the message firing clear area for thirty seconds before a blue flash of light is emitted from the antenna scp2820 will then focus on a new target within twentyfour hours of firing the initial target will invariably be killed by the culmination of a nonlinear system formed by a series of coincidental occurrences commonly known as the butterfly effect at which time scp2820 will fire again notably eyewitness testimonies in the aftermath of the targets death consistently mention the appearance of a chimpanzee in a trench coat video recordings and forensic investigations into the aftermath of scp2820 kills indicate that the chimpanzee does not actually exist it is purely a perceptual phenomenon resulting from the aforementioned nonlinear system the occurrences that produce the nonlinear system are not anomalous themselves ranging from slipping on ice to purchasing cough medicine though exact replication of these events is tedious difficult and resourceintensive scp2820 was initially recovered on from an abandoned prometheus labs facility near varanasi india shortly before firing and eliminating known target 58 logged communications with scp2820javascript hide logsjavascript last

primary anomaly suffered a traumatic brain injury and fell into a coma from which they have not recovered the primary anomaly was recovered and has been on intravenous life support for the past years testimony of p i was tracking the reality interviewer anomaly p right i was tracking the anomaly through porto seguro my job was basically to find out where she where it was going to ground where its safe house was so to speak i had a gun and tranquilizer of course but i couldnt really do body armor or anything without sticking out like a sore thumb plus it was the hottest day of the summer i wouldve boiled alive anyways i followed the anomaly into the downtown cidade alta its called and i saw something out of the corner of my eye we were going down this alleyway between a bunch of flats and it was getting really windy and i got distracted by this tornup trash bag out of the corner of my eye i mean anyways i started looking at this bag because it also made sense you know to not be looking at the anomaly in case she looked back but then i got jumped it wasnt the anomaly just some smalltime crook with a submachine gun wasnt even holding it right i was reaching into my pocket to give him a fake wallet and then there was just a clattering of gunfire and first i thought i was dead but then i realized no my ears were ringing and i couldnt hear anything else so i had to be alive so i just kicked back on reflex to disarm the kid and then i got a good look around that fucking trash bag had blown up behind us and smacked into the kid there was like a rock in it or something and spooked him so his shots went all over the damn place and one of those shots mustve hit the buildings and this massive chunk of brick came down and absolutely brained the reality bender so the gangbanger was on the ground and the bend anomaly was probably dead so i called in for backup and thats pretty much what happened though there was one more weird thing probably nothing but you cant be too careful with anomalies like that interviewer what was it p when the wind picked up the bag well it almost looked like a circus monkey running away like you ever seen in calvin and hobbes where

    "my ud expansion revamped chapter 8 links to prologuechapter 6 link to chapter 7 emily segment honestly this segment is one of the most iconic and thrilling scenes so theres not much id change that wont be said in the chases post but i will say that at the end if emily misses any of the 3 qtes while jumping to the line instead of the chase ending theres a dont move as she hides behind a tree while the wendigo searches for her if she fails theres a special death scene of her body being repeatedly slammed against the nearby tree if she succeeds it will be safe enough to make a run for the lodge otherwise succeeding all final 3 qtes has her saved failing certain previous parts of this chase can get her killed if killed by hannah she has her eyes gouged by her claws much like ingame if killed by beth she has her claws jam into the top of ems head and through her skull if she failed the ore grinder qtes she has her lower body grinned up if she fails any of the final 3 qtes and then fails the dont move she has her body bashed against the tree if she makes it through the chase we see the cutscene of her making a run for the lodge chris segment if emily survived her chase chris and the group meet with her as she finally makes her way back if she died in her chase they would just be visited by the stranger emily can mention meeting with and finding jessica and chris can then ask why jess isnt with her or how she found her asking her the first question when em abandoned jess causes her to admit to what she did and how she feels horrible for it or just awkwardly admitting it if her relationship with jess was at 0 her admitting this can have negative consequences in the saferoom also shed definitely mention meeting with the flamethrower guy in the mines to the group and how they should take him seriously ash depending on the decisions made in the saw and gun traps will either kiss chris and wish him luck remain silent as he goes out or just simply wish him luck without kissing him now chris segment has quite the changes depending on if he shot himself in the last chapter due to blanks actually being able to cause harm he would be hindered during his chase after rolling under the log and shooting the wendigo hell be forced off trail and would be fine if he didnt shoot himself but if he did he will have a set of 3 qtes as he runs through the forest failing 1 of the 3 results in him having to shoot the wendigo while failing 2 of the 3 results in him being killed as after his fail he isnt able to react quick enough to shoot the wendigo if he makes it through the 3 qtes or just the log roll and aim segment hell be met with a decision he can either jump down from his high point similar to what he does in his chase or hes able to go around it jumping down will injure his leg like it does in game and hes given the last 2 aim segments before reaching the lodge however if he chooses to go around itll be possible for him to avoid injuring his leg hell have 3 qtes as he runs through the forest failing 1 of the 3 results in him stumbling and injuring his leg still but failing 2 of the 3 causes his immediate death as hes not able to react quick enough whether he avoids the leg injury or not will have more impact in chapter 9 similar to if em was able to avoid her knee injury in chapter 7 after going through the 2 aim segments outside the lodge hell reach the door and the scene with ash letting him in or leaving him outside will play out however there is a lot more complexity to this scene now depending on what chris did in both the saw and gun traps as well as their general relationship and choices made in earlier chapters it not only affects this scene but their relationship as well ash discovers the psychos identity she will always open the door and will either kiss him or not but maintain their friendship depending on the saw trap decision and their relationship chris saved ash in the saw traplied about it ash always lets him in and still has romantic feelings even if he shot her since if he saved her she asks him to shoot her but if their interactions other than that were generally negative they wont kiss in chapter 5 chris confessed to not saving ash in the saw trap if chris shoots himself they will have an intact friendship though if their interactions were more negative it is strained if he admitted to not saving her back then and shoots her she will not open the door for him if he finishes the chase if their interactions other than that were generally more positive it will be like the remake where she spaces out and reaches the door too late if their interactions were generally more negative it will be like the original where she steps back away from the door and chooses not to save him if he did nothing then itll depend on their relationship for a high relationship she saves him but their relationship is strained for a low relationship she doesnt save him if chris dies before reaching the door ashleys reactions will vary if he died when she still had feelings or their friendship was still saved we get the normal reaction where if chris shot himself if he died when their friendship was strained we get a similar reaction to what wouldve happened if he didnt make it and he shot ash with her crying and going to the safe room on her own if he dies before reaching the door when ash wouldve not opened the door we see ash standing still by the door as she watches chris head roll towards her before its picked up by the wendigo shes nearly emotionless and numb showing just how mentally unstable she is at this point she has to be basically dragged by mike to the saferoom chris can die in the chase by having his head ripped off how it is varies by washington sibling hannah drives her claws into his throat before seperating it from the rest of his body beth just grabs his head and pulls on it until it comes off taking some of his spinal cord with him regardless of whatever happens whether chris makes it to the lodge or not ash mike and determinately chris will make their way down to the saferoom the saferoom scene can happen after but if at least one of or both jessicamatt are alive well get entirely new segment matt jess segments determinant this segment is only playable if either or both matt and jess are still alive if both jess and matt are alive we play as jessica first we start off from the cutscene with her hearing a noise and hiding shell grab a shovel as were then given an aim segment on a silhouette if she hits it or fails its revealed to be matt who had gotten himself stuck down here while finding a way out or tried going after emily and her after previously seeing themher in the last chapter jess can either explain that her and em were seperated or question if em was really down there with them as shes been alone the 2 talk and explain whats happened to them and begin to explore together if jess is dead then we begin as matt who stumbles upon the area and play the whole segment as him if matt is dead then jessica just hears a noise that startles her before continuing on we play as her the whole segment the both of them try finding a way out of the mines as they have some exploration with clues to find around the halfway point of the exploring wed switch to matt at some point who still has his axe and we continue playing as him in the second half of the pairs segment there will be some cool scenes where they help eachother cross certain paths with jess being able to crawl through claustrophobic spaces to get to the other side or matt using his axe to break down doors and wood and such if matt or jess are alone due to the others death then we just play the entire segment as them exploring the mines alone in the areas where one would help the other to another area wed have to use alternate routes to further progress all while missing a few clues as a result in this next scene if matt and jess are together we are currently playing as matt theyll reach a point where they seemingly found a way out when theyre confronted by the wendigo who approaches the mine entrance theyll see the wendigo carrying the bodies of the stranger and determinately chris as well as the unconscious body of josh itll let go of them in order to pursue the duolone person and well have another chase scene here with more complexity and length then their normal chase in the mines itll be possible for either or both of matt and jess to die here and if the 2 are together and matt fails the qtes and is killed we take over as jess itll also be possible for matt to save himself or jess at certain points if he still had the flaregun ill make a post soon about how the chase goes along with the em and chris chases at the end of the chase after 2 sets of qtes and 2 sets of hide or or run decisions well have 2 different scenes if jess is alone we get one final dont move with succeeding resulting in her entering a nearby gap that leads to another area of the mine as matt either alone or with jess we get a decision to either hide which gives us one last dont move similar to the jess scenario or we can destroy the support pillars for this tunnel if matt chooses to do so and is with jess he screams to her to keep running he then gets 2 aim segments for each beam as he strikes them with his axe failing either causes his death if he succeeds the tunnel begins crumbling as the wendigo chases matt hell make it in time as the tunnel collapses behind him and a cave in occurs cutting the wendigo off from him and determinately jessica however the tunnel would continue to collapse and theyre not safe they would continue running matt having qtes to keep himself going or to help jessica succeeding the qtes has him reach the gap him alone or with jess able to get through to another area of the mine failing however will have jess reach the gap if shes with him while matt barely fails to as he prioritizes helping her the tunnel collapses and cuts matt off from the gapjessica but he isnt killed he sees himself forced to follow this other route giving an alternate path for him matt being killed by hannah has her bash his face in like ingame matt being killed by beth has her jam her claws into his head before slashing down tearing deep into his skull and carving some of his flesh out jess being killed by hannah has her jam her fingers up through her mouth jamming it into her brain and tearing off her lower jaw much like ingame jess being killed by beth has her lift jess up before smashing her face against the hard mine walls by the end of the segment matt and jess can either be dead going through the gap togetheralone or in a scenario for matt going down a darker tunnel that leads him to a familiar face later on mike and ash segments this scene has a lot of variation depending on whos alive and dead if chris died obviously sam and em can attempt to comfort ash if em is dead or wasnt bitten due to keeping the flaregun and shooting the wendigo the bite drama can be entirely avoided however if she was bitten there is actually 2 things that can happen depending on what happened in the traps and whether chris is alive or not can change the way ashley approaches the situation of the bite if the following requirements happened ashley will not freak out as badly and can actually search for clues in the book before resorting to kicking em out and mike can actually wait for ash to read through to see if bites are infectious if chris saved ash in the saw traplied about it ashley discovered the psychos identity and stopped the gun trap early and chris is still alive the bite drama wont get as bad as it does in game and ash manages to prevent herself and mike from making the situation worse by finding out the bite isnt infectious in the book em is mildly annoyed with them for assuming but her relationship with them remains positive if any of the 3 requirements are missed due to ashleys poor mental state this results in her reacting the way she normally does and causes mike to continue acting the way he does towards emily which leads to him aiming the gun at her if emily had previously mentioned abandoning jess then even if ash manages to remain calm this causes emily and mike to argue more and him holding the gun at her still happens if ash was less stable and em mentioned abandoning jess this causes both ash and mike to get on her about it due to mikes relationship with jess and ashleys expanded friendship with her if this happens no matter what mike will be pushed to the limit and shoot emily while in all other scenarios wed have a choice or the option to shoot her doesnt happen now mike will leave the saferoom for the sanatorium with the bite drama either completely avoided due to em using the flaregun to prevent her bite or her dying before reaching the lodge prevented from progessing as bad as it can with ash being more stable and looking for a solution in the book or reaching extremes in the situation with mike aiming the gun at emily and either shooting her or stopping himself from doing it we can get some friendship moments between em and sam here with them just talking or sam comforting emily if ash previously looked through the book for the bite shed pick it back up after some conversation with em sam and chris and find out about the wendigos in the sanatorium which cause them all to go after mike otherwise shed find the other clues along with the sanatorium after mike leaves of course if the bite drama progressed as badly as it can its still possible for em to hold a grudge against ash if she reveals the bite isnt infectious after yelling at her about it this causes em to say the most iconic line in the game and slap her for it and as we know this decision made by ash will have negative consequences in the future and its still possible for ash to keep the bite fact secret to save face but this causes a relationship decrease with sam everyones status after chapter 8 jessica dead or going through the mine gap either alone or with matt matt dead going through the mine gap with jess or alone or going down a mine tunnel after failing to reach the gap emily dead or following sam chris dead or following sam ashley alive and following sam sam alive and leading all alive safe group members to the sanatorium to stop mike mike alive and heading for the sanatorium josh alive but unconscious being taken by handigobethigo",

    "my friend and i found the abandoned church behind our town behind our town is a massive hill stretching out either side with a forest of thick cedar trees at its edge theres a rumour of an old church hidden behind it and its said that inside is a fountain that has special powers its more of an old wives tale that gets passed around the town that night my friend and i decided we were going to find it how the hell are you going to sneak out your parents are super strict claire said resting her chin in her palm i dont know probably just quietly through the back door i shrugged and if they find out youre gone youre going to be grounded for a month again she drummed her fingers lightly on the bench well we could go during the day i said rolling my eyes thats no fun claire said with a playful glint in her eyes what about your parents i tiptoed around the question what about them her nose wrinkled in distaste i leaned in well how are you going to sneak out she tilted her head slightly eyes fixed on the ground unfocused theyll be too drunk to notice i doubt they will even know im home to begin with she tugged at her jacket sleeves trying to pull them over her hands where do we meet her lips curled into a smile the old highway sign in front of the hill the bell for next period rang out and i slung my backpack over my shoulder what time i asked as she dragged her satchel off the seat eleven she narrowed her eyes grinning that night at the dinner table my dad sighed picking at his food i got a call from your english teacher today his eyes shifted to me what did she say i kept my head down youre falling behind homework and studies he glanced at my mom yeah sorry i its that friend of yours clara my dad interrupted shoving food into his mouth claire i pushed food around my plate whatever her name is shes a bad influence on you i mean ive never seen her or her parents at church unless theyre going for the food drive he was starting to raise his voice charles my mom scolded him all im saying is he put his knife and fork down your goal is to get good grades so you can get into a good college and make something of yourself thats all me and your mother want for you noted i grunted maybe if her father didnt beat his daughter so much shed be as bright as you he muttered my face felt hot i clenched my fists charles thats enough my mom said her words short and sharp i stood up pushing the chair away and storming upstairs my dad called out to me but i ignored him i ran up the stairs and into my room slamming the door my phone buzzed claire hey i snuck out early can we meet soon i could still feel the anger burning yeah i slid the phone into my pocket threw my jacket on and opened my window pushing the mesh off i carefully slid out and put it back down the roof creaked as i crept down it careful not to slip or make any noise my knees screamed as i dropped into the back yard i glanced at the kitchen window and heard my parents arguing i ducked into the bushes then climbed over the fence into the alleyway next to our house and jogged towards the hill my jacket did little against the cold night air it took me about ten minutes of walking to get to the sign just outside of town claire was standing beneath it smoking the dim light of the embers illuminated her face softly in the dark is that a cigarette i asked approaching the sign uh yeah she held it out to me i caught her gaze and she looked away no thanks i said as casually as possible i stole it from my dad he was being a dick and i needed it she took a long drag before dropping it and stomping it out i stood there for a moment thinking about what my dad had said shall we she gestured towards the hill yyeah i murmured we climbed the hill stopping occasionally to catch our breath at the top we could see the forest stretch out tall dense trees crowded for miles i felt my phone vibrate in my pocket i pulled it out and saw it was my dad i clicked the phone off and slid it back into my pocket your dad know youre gone claire said looking over at me he does now i sighed arent you worried about getting grounded her voice pushed clouds into the cold air fuck em i said kicking a rock down the hill claire smiled as if i had said something she had been thinking for a while we set off into the forest using our phones as flashlights did we take into account that there might not be a church i ventured shining my light around in the darkness well its a nice night for a walk in the forest claire laughed do you know who youre taking to the winter prom she teased my face felt warm oh uh i probably wont go i said stumbling my words oh yeah pssh me neither claire said laughing nervously and throwing a rock she had picked up a moment of silence fell over us as we pushed further in i hope you remember the way back out i said half joking half worried that she might not have been paying attention i thought you were keeping track she said turning to look at me my face dropped her lips curled into a smile im fucking with you ive been mapping it i let out a sigh and laughed fuck you dud my foot snagged on a tree root and i went tumbling down a hill claire called my name running down after me i hit something hard at the bottom a wall ah fuck i groaned grabbing my side in pain claire ran to my side helping me sit up are you okay dude that looked like it hurt i clenched my jaw im okay im fine she stood up and took a few steps back oh shit her voice trailed off i stood up slowly and turned to face where she was looking the church white clapboard siding though the paint had long since started peeling and graying in the damp climate the steeple rose up its oxidized copper roof catching the beam of my light in a dull orange glow the pine forest pressed close on every side of the building the double doors sat partially open fuck my words caught in my throat me and claire exchanged looks before she took a deep breath and stepped towards it she pressed on one of the doors pushing it inwards and creeping inside i hesitated looking around the forest before finally entering behind her the inside was overgrown with trees growing through the broken windows grass and weeds were pushing through the floorboards there was a damp smell that hung in the air rot and earth and something older this is creepy as hell claire whispered walking down the aisle looking up at the ceiling i followed behind her looking between the pews they were all either warped broken or flipped over well uh i dont see a fountain anywhere claire clicked her tongue stopping at the altar i paced over to a closet and pulled the door open dust exploded outwards sending me into a coughing fit i shone my light inside revealing old robes some bibles stacked lazily in the corner and a large concrete slab hey claire check this out i called over to her she walked over peeking inside spooky she said touching the robe with her fingers no dude look i pointed at the slab now were talking she grinned cmon help me move it we pulled it out dragging it along the floorboards underneath was a round hole with a passageway that led down a rusted metal ladder disappeared into the dark fuck i dont know if i want to go down there i said nervously shining my light down the hole claire bit her lip deep in thought before looking at me and grinning see you on the other side before i could react she began climbing down the ladder it creaked and groaned as she descended fuck i muttered under my breath climbing down after her the air grew heavier as i descended the ladder didnt feel stable at all and i was worried it would break at any moment my palms were slick against the cold metal rungs it was a long way down taking about a minute to reach the bottom the hole opened up into a hallway made of stone claire was waiting at the bottom shining her light around the small space i wasnt typically a claustrophobic person but the walls seemed to squeeze inwards the ceiling was low enough that i had to duck my head slightly the stone was damp to the touch lets find this fountain hey claire murmured claire wait i replied this seems dangerous she turned awkwardly shifting to fit her shoulders in the small space well be okay she flashed a reassuring smile i didnt feel very reassured what if we get hurt down here i asked trying to keep her from continuing down the corridor she just rolled her eyes and smiled cmon you worry too much i took a breath and followed her reluctantly the hallway stretched on our footsteps echoed strangely against the stone the beam from my phone light seemed weaker down here swallowed by the dark before it could reach very far finally the corridor opened into a kind of atrium a circular room with corridors branching off in multiple directions now this is cool claire laughed in disbelief i had to admit i was pretty impressed i paced around the room slowly the stone walls were smooth almost polished there were markings carved into them worn too smooth to read what do you think they used this for i asked shining my light around probably for sacrificing people i laughed nervously well thank fuck its abandoned claire turned her head to look at me that we know of the air was thick and heavy the atrium was completely silent so silent i could hear my heartbeat in my ears so silent i could hear claire breathing beside me well claire spun around lets pick a corridor i guess wait my heart dropped what corridor did we enter from oh it was she turned and ran her tongue over her teeth in thought she pursed her lips we might be fucked i threw my hands in the air goddamnit claire i fucking told you this was a bad idea she rolled her eyes were fine well just split up and pick a corridor each and when we find it we will meet back here youre kidding there is no fucking way im splitting up down here i couldnt believe how casual she was being come on bailey nothing bad ever happens to girls who split up in creepy tunnels she teased she caught my look of disapproval and she sighed okay fine we will explore together i let out a sigh of relief i couldnt tell if she was joking the whole time she spun in a circle with her arm out and finger pointed and stopped on a random corridor this one i rubbed my face with my hands sure she started down the hallway and after some internal debate i followed where do you think these all lead i asked tracing my hand along the grooves in the stone well this one leads to the sacrifice chamber aaaand the other leads to more sacrifice chambers i sighed im serious claire alright sorry just trying to lighten the mood eventually the hallway opened up into a small room it was an office complete with bookshelves lined with binders and an old wooden desk covered in paper and documents we found the office claire clicked her tongue shit i groaned shining my light on the documents splayed out on the table they were mostly receipts corporate jargon that i couldnt understand some shipping manifestos claire pulled a binder off the shelf and opened it on the desk woah her eyes lit up i looked over her shoulder at the contents of the binder pages and pages of photo copies of peoples passport photos what the fuck i mouthed she flicked through the rest of the pages before closing it and grabbing another one the next binder was filled with more photos is this all the people from the church maybe claire ventured sliding out a random photo and flipping it over richard milson she continued reading the name on the back written in black ink ddo you think they killed these people my voice came out hoarse yeah she said grinning maybe they were all murdered im being serious i pushed her playfully i dont know she shrugged whatever reason though its still creepy as hell she pushed me back laughing well i dont know about you but im keen to get the hell out of here i muttered are you kidding claire closed the binder weve hit the jackpot we cant bail now claire seriously its dangerous down here we need to find the way out and head back i tried to command some urgency into my voice ooh kay she sighed crossing her arms gotta get home to your nice bed and your loving parents i get it oh come on dont put that bullshit on me you know thats not fair i argued back it was your idea to come down here at night i thought you were keeping track of the fucking directions in this fucking death trap her face twisted in disgust you know what youre such a perfect fucking grade a student find your own way out do you have a problem with me because you seem to be bringing up shit that isnt relevant to our fucking situation right now i yelled back our voices echoed loudly through the tunnels you have no idea how good you fucking have it do you claire was interrupted by a noise echoing from inside the tunnels what the fuck was that i spun towards the doorway breath ragged from the argument nothing it was probably just your complaining bouncing off the fucking ceiling claire pushed past me her eyes wet and stormed down the hallway her light bouncing around in the darkness god fucking damnit i yelled feeling my own tears streaming down my cheeks claire wait please i called after her heart racing not wanting to lose her in the darkness whats wrong too scared to find your own way out she yelled over her shoulder her light disappeared ahead and i picked up the pace trying to catch up claire please wait i screamed after her terrified of being alone i ran out into the atrium and it was completely empty my breaths were fast and my heart was racing claire please dont leave me here please i called out trying to listen for her i knelt down sobbing into my arms feeling completely alone in the dark silence being interrupted by my hitching sobs im sorry please im sorry i was so desperate for her to come back i wouldve done anything i sat there in the dark for minutes trying to regulate my breathing listening for any clues to which direction she went in bailey my head shot up hearing claires voice echo from a corridor claire claire i jumped up please claire where are you after a pause her voice called out again seemingly from everywhere bailey help claire please keep talking so i can find you i called out nose still running bailey please help her voice called out again and i thought i could hear it coming from my left there were three passageways it could have been though and the way her voice echoed i couldnt be sure i picked the middle corridor and took off sprinting down the passageway my light barely illuminated the space in front of me claire im coming i called out again i came to the end of the corridor and into a much bigger room it was another corridor with rows of doors on the left and right claire my voice cracked silence i thought i might have taken the wrong passageway until something slammed against the inside of one of the doors i screamed falling back startled by the sudden noise claire i called out again stop fucking around and come out a shiver ran down my spine when i heard her voice again bailey let me out please claires voice came from the other side of the door ddid you accidentally lock yourself in i asked into the darkness my breathing was ragged and i couldnt hear anything over my heart thumping in my ears i slowly climbed to my feet and crept towards the door a low soft crying noise came from the inside of one of the rooms i hesitated at the doorway and pressed my ear against it bailey im sorry please let me out claires voice came directly from the other side of the door my hand closed around the lock on the brass handle of the door i hesitated waiting for an excuse not to open it i squeezed my eyes shut and unlocked the door stepping back and shining my light after a few seconds the handle twisted slowly and the door swung inwards with a long drawn out groan i swallowed hard cclaire silence fell over the hallway my light shook in my hands as i tried to keep it steady on the doorway my heart dropped as a face slowly peered out from the doorway long matted black hair and a pale face with huge pupils peered out revealing a gaping mouth with no teeth i couldnt move i couldnt even scream i was completely frozen in fear staring in horror as it slowly slunk out of the room thin frail hands crept over its face shielding it from my light it screamed ear piercing guttural a noise that shot me into action i turned and sprinted down the hallway screaming absolute terror filling my body adrenaline surging through me i could hear something running behind me bare feet slapping against the floor i burst out into the atrium and picked a random tunnel and ran down it hoping to lose whatever the fuck was chasing me i came out in another room i barely registered any details of the room just running towards a door partially open it led down a set of stairs and i hurried down it careful not to fall the smell hit me as soon as i hit the end of the staircase i covered my mouth and nose retching violently the room smelt of rot meat and shit literal shit i raised my flashlight to illuminate the space the floor was stained red and black and covering the walls were smears of what looked and smelt of blood and shit i gagged and puked all over my feet i dry retched again too scared to go back up the stairs but unable to stay in the room any longer i scanned the room for any other way out but was only met with more bodily fluid smeared walls i couldnt take it the smell was making my vision double i ran back up the stairs i slowly crept back through the door scanning the room with the light before entering i couldnt see the creature anywhere and i crept further inside the room had a wooden table stained a deep red with a bucket and a large plastic container underneath i looked in the container for a weapon but found only old wallets car keys and some random crap that looked as if a bunch of people had emptied their pockets inside it i heard something from far off in the tunnels and i stopped going completely silent and still listening to hear if it was coming towards me when it went silent i took a deep breath saying a silent prayer and continuing to look my eyes landed on a metal fireplace poker and i lunged for it picking it up and holding it close to me i felt a little better having some kind of weapon but the knowledge id have to venture back down the hallway to get out was so terrifying i wondered if id ever leave i felt tears on my cheeks again and a lump caught in my throat i had the overwhelming sense of guilt remembering that claire was down here with me and id accidentally released something and it was probably going after her now i decided that i had to do something even if the thing killed me i had to save claire hesitating for another moment i squeezed the fireplace poker cold in my hands and went back down the hallway i held it out in front of me feeling the weight of it in my hand the main atrium was empty and the silence was deafening i spun slowly in the middle swinging my light trying to look down the hallways my heart thumped in my ears and i picked another corridor at random creeping down it poker raised i made it halfway down the corridor when i heard something scream behind me the same ear piercing cry that would haunt me the rest of my life i screamed too taking off sprinting to the end of the corridor i heard the bare feet slapping behind me closer and closer i screamed louder pure fear and terror pumping through me i ran straight into something cold and hard my hands closed around it the rungs of the ladder i wasnt even afforded a sigh of relief hearing the thing closing in right behind me i threw myself up the ladder phone barely hanging on in one hand and trying to hold on to the poker in the other my hands were greasy with sweat and occasionally they would slip off the rungs the ladder shifted below me creaking and groaning as the thing seemingly climbed after me the poker slid out of my hand and i heard it hit something with a wet thump the climb felt endless pure panic being the only thing driving me upwards i finally came out into the closet pulling myself up desperately still sobbing i pushed the heavy concrete slab back over the hole still crying i backed away from it before sprinting through the church and out into the cold night air hey you took your time claires voice came from beside the doors she was leaning against the wall clicking her lighter on and off a mixture of fear guilt and rage washed over me and i broke down crying falling into her arms she stood there stunned i couldnt speak i couldnt even form coherent sentences i just sobbed right into her jacket for a minute oh shit bailey are you good you smell awful she nervously patted my back i lifted my head snot and tears covering her jacket we need to go now i cried alright alright what the fuck did you see down there dude i yanked her arm and we climbed back up the hill the entire way back through the forest she wouldnt stop asking me questions i ignored them and pulled her back through the trees making her guide the way she walked me back home my heart dropped as we stood at the end of the street blue and red flashing lights illuminated my house i ran to the door claire stayed at the end of the street i burst through into the living room where my parents were sat holding each other mom crying as a policeman sat across from them as soon as they saw me they rushed over and wrapped me in a hug i cried again harder than i ever had before harder than i thought possible so hard that no noise came out as if the pressure in my head would make my eyes explode they had called the police soon after i snuck out id been gone three and a half hours i struggled to figure out what to tell the police eventually landing on a convincing lie that i had gotten lost in the forest my parents knew i had been with claire and i didnt care i never spoke to her again after that night i ignored her at school and after a few days she understood and left me alone to this day i still have nightmares about that church and whatever the fuck is happening beneath it",
    "my friend and i found the abandoned church behind our town behind our town is a massive hill stretching out either side with a forest of thick cedar trees at its edge theres a rumour of an old church hidden behind it and its said that inside is a fountain that has special powers its more of an old wives tale that gets passed around the town that night my friend and i decided we were going to find it how the hell are you going to sneak out your parents are super strict claire said resting her chin in her palm i dont know probably just quietly through the back door i shrugged and if they find out youre gone youre going to be grounded for a month again she drummed her fingers lightly on the bench well we could go during the day i said rolling my eyes thats no fun claire said with a playful glint in her eyes what about your parents i tiptoed around the question what about them her nose wrinkled in distaste i leaned in well how are you going to sneak out she tilted her head slightly eyes fixed on the ground unfocused theyll be too drunk to notice i doubt they will even know im home to begin with she tugged at her jacket sleeves trying to pull them over her hands where do we meet her lips curled into a smile the old highway sign in front of the hill the bell for next period rang out and i slung my backpack over my shoulder what time i asked as she dragged her satchel off the seat eleven she narrowed her eyes grinning that night at the dinner table my dad sighed picking at his food i got a call from your english teacher today his eyes shifted to me what did she say i kept my head down youre falling behind homework and studies he glanced at my mom yeah sorry i its that friend of yours clara my dad interrupted shoving food into his mouth claire i pushed food around my plate whatever her name is shes a bad influence on you i mean ive never seen her or her parents at church unless theyre going for the food drive he was starting to raise his voice charles my

slowly in the middle swinging my light trying to look down the hallways my heart thumped in my ears and i picked another corridor at random creeping down it poker raised i made it halfway down the corridor when i heard something scream behind me the same ear piercing cry that would haunt me the rest of my life i screamed too taking off sprinting to the end of the corridor i heard the bare feet slapping behind me closer and closer i screamed louder pure fear and terror pumping through me i ran straight into something cold and hard my hands closed around it the rungs of the ladder i wasnt even afforded a sigh of relief hearing the thing closing in right behind me i threw myself up the ladder phone barely hanging on in one hand and trying to hold on to the poker in the other my hands were greasy with sweat and occasionally they would slip off the rungs the ladder shifted below me creaking and groaning as the thing seemingly climbed after me the poker slid out of my hand and i heard it hit something with a wet thump the climb felt endless pure panic being the only thing driving me upwards i finally came out into the closet pulling myself up desperately still sobbing i pushed the heavy concrete slab back over the hole still crying i backed away from it before sprinting through the church and out into the cold night air hey you took your time claires voice came from beside the doors she was leaning against the wall clicking her lighter on and off a mixture of fear guilt and rage washed over me and i broke down crying falling into her arms she stood there stunned i couldnt speak i couldnt even form coherent sentences i just sobbed right into her jacket for a minute oh shit bailey are you good you smell awful she nervously patted my back i lifted my head snot and tears covering her jacket we need to go now i cried alright alright what the fuck did you see down there dude i yanked her arm and we climbed back up the hill the entire way back through the forest she wouldnt stop asking me questions i ignored them and pulled her back through the trees making her guide the way she walked me back home my heart dropped as we stood at the end of the street blue and red flashing lights illuminated my house i ran to the door claire stayed at the end of the street i burst through into the living room where my parents were sat holding each other mom crying as a policeman sat across from them as soon as they saw me they rushed over and wrapped me in a hug i cried again harder than i ever had before harder than i thought possible so hard that no noise came out as if the pressure in my head would make my eyes explode they had called the police soon after i snuck out id been gone three and a half hours i struggled to figure out what to tell the police eventually landing on a convincing lie that i had gotten lost in the forest my parents knew i had been with claire and i didnt care i never spoke to her again after that night i ignored her at school and after a few days she understood and left me alone to this day i still have nightmares about that church and whatever the fuck is happening beneath it",
    "my friend and i found the abandoned church behind my town behind our town is a massive hill stretching out either side with a forest of thick cedar trees at its edge theres a rumour of an old church hidden behind it and its said that inside is a fountain that has special powers its more of an old wives tale that gets passed around the town that night my friend and i decided we were going to find it how the hell are you going to sneak out your parents are super strict claire said resting her chin in her palm i dont know probably just quietly through the back door i shrugged and if they find out youre gone youre going to be grounded for a month again she drummed her fingers lightly on the bench well we could go during the day i said rolling my eyes thats no fun claire said with a playful glint in her eyes what about your parents i tiptoed around the question what about them her nose wrinkled in distaste i leaned in well how are you going to sneak out she tilted her head slightly eyes fixed on the ground unfocused theyll be too drunk to notice i doubt they will even know im home to begin with she tugged at her jacket sleeves trying to pull them over her hands where do we meet her lips curled into a smile the old highway sign in front of the hill the bell for next period rang out and i slung my backpack over my shoulder what time i asked as she dragged her satchel off the seat eleven she narrowed her eyes grinning that night at the dinner table my dad sighed picking at his food i got a call from your english teacher today his eyes shifted to me what did she say i kept my head down youre falling behind homework and studies he glanced at my mom yeah sorry i its that friend of yours clara my dad interrupted shoving food into his mouth claire i pushed food around my plate whatever her name is shes a bad influence on you i mean ive never seen her or her parents at church unless theyre going for the food drive he was starting to raise his voice charles my mom scolded him all im saying is he put his knife and fork down your goal is to get good grades so you can get into a good college and make something of yourself thats all me and your mother want for you noted i grunted maybe if her father didnt beat his daughter so much shed be as bright as you he muttered my face felt hot i clenched my fists charles thats enough my mom said her words short and sharp i stood up pushing the chair away and storming upstairs my dad called out to me but i ignored him i ran up the stairs and into my room slamming the door my phone buzzed claire hey i snuck out early can we meet soon i could still feel the anger burning yeah i slid the phone into my pocket threw my jacket on and opened my window pushing the mesh off i carefully slid out and put it back down the roof creaked as i crept down it careful not to slip or make any noise my knees screamed as i dropped into the back yard i glanced at the kitchen window and heard my parents arguing i ducked into the bushes then climbed over the fence into the alleyway next to our house and jogged towards the hill my jacket did little against the cold night air it took me about ten minutes of walking to get to the sign just outside of town claire was standing beneath it smoking the dim light of the embers illuminated her face softly in the dark is that a cigarette i asked approaching the sign uh yeah she held it out to me i caught her gaze and she looked away no thanks i said as casually as possible i stole it from my dad he was being a dick and i needed it she took a long drag before dropping it and stomping it out i stood there for a moment thinking about what my dad had said shall we she gestured towards the hill yyeah i murmured we climbed the hill stopping occasionally to catch our breath at the top we could see the forest stretch out tall dense trees crowded for miles i felt my phone vibrate in my pocket i pulled it out and saw it was my dad i clicked the phone off and slid it back into my pocket your dad know youre gone claire said looking over at me he does now i sighed arent you worried about getting grounded her voice pushed clouds into the cold air fuck em i said kicking a rock down the hill claire smiled as if i had said something she had been thinking for a while we set off into the forest using our phones as flashlights did we take into account that there might not be a church i ventured shining my light around in the darkness well its a nice night for a walk in the forest claire laughed do you know who youre taking to the winter prom she teased my face felt warm oh uh i probably wont go i said stumbling my words oh yeah pssh me neither claire said laughing nervously and throwing a rock she had picked up a moment of silence fell over us as we pushed further in i hope you remember the way back out i said half joking half worried that she might not have been paying attention i thought you were keeping track she said turning to look at me my face dropped her lips curled into a smile im fucking with you ive been mapping it i let out a sigh and laughed fuck you dud my foot snagged on a tree root and i went tumbling down a hill claire called my name running down after me i hit something hard at the bottom a wall ah fuck i groaned grabbing my side in pain claire ran to my side helping me sit up are you okay dude that looked like it hurt i clenched my jaw im okay im fine she stood up and took a few steps back oh shit her voice trailed off i stood up slowly and turned to face where she was looking the church white clapboard siding though the paint had long since started peeling and graying in the damp climate the steeple rose up its oxidized copper roof catching the beam of my light in a dull orange glow the pine forest pressed close on every side of the building the double doors sat partially open fuck my words caught in my throat me and claire exchanged looks before she took a deep breath and stepped towards it she pressed on one of the doors pushing it inwards and creeping inside i hesitated looking around the forest before finally entering behind her the inside was overgrown with trees growing through the broken windows grass and weeds were pushing through the floorboards there was a damp smell that hung in the air rot and earth and something older this is creepy as hell claire whispered walking down the aisle looking up at the ceiling i followed behind her looking between the pews they were all either warped broken or flipped over well uh i dont see a fountain anywhere claire clicked her tongue stopping at the altar i paced over to a closet and pulled the door open dust exploded outwards sending me into a coughing fit i shone my light inside revealing old robes some bibles stacked lazily in the corner and a large concrete slab hey claire check this out i called over to her she walked over peeking inside spooky she said touching the robe with her fingers no dude look i pointed at the slab now were talking she grinned cmon help me move it we pulled it out dragging it along the floorboards underneath was a round hole with a passageway that led down a rusted metal ladder disappeared into the dark fuck i dont know if i want to go down there i said nervously shining my light down the hole claire bit her lip deep in thought before looking at me and grinning see you on the other side before i could react she began climbing down the ladder it creaked and groaned as she descended fuck i muttered under my breath climbing down after her the air grew heavier as i descended the ladder didnt feel stable at all and i was worried it would break at any moment my palms were slick against the cold metal rungs it was a long way down taking about a minute to reach the bottom the hole opened up into a hallway made of stone claire was waiting at the bottom shining her light around the small space i wasnt typically a claustrophobic person but the walls seemed to squeeze inwards the ceiling was low enough that i had to duck my head slightly the stone was damp to the touch lets find this fountain hey claire murmured claire wait i replied this seems dangerous she turned awkwardly shifting to fit her shoulders in the small space well be okay she flashed a reassuring smile i didnt feel very reassured what if we get hurt down here i asked trying to keep her from continuing down the corridor she just rolled her eyes and smiled cmon you worry too much i took a breath and followed her reluctantly the hallway stretched on our footsteps echoed strangely against the stone the beam from my phone light seemed weaker down here swallowed by the dark before it could reach very far finally the corridor opened into a kind of atrium a circular room with corridors branching off in multiple directions now this is cool claire laughed in disbelief i had to admit i was pretty impressed i paced around the room slowly the stone walls were smooth almost polished there were markings carved into them worn too smooth to read what do you think they used this for i asked shining my light around probably for sacrificing people i laughed nervously well thank fuck its abandoned claire turned her head to look at me that we know of the air was thick and heavy the atrium was completely silent so silent i could hear my heartbeat in my ears so silent i could hear claire breathing beside me well claire spun around lets pick a corridor i guess wait my heart dropped what corridor did we enter from oh it was she turned and ran her tongue over her teeth in thought she pursed her lips we might be fucked i threw my hands in the air goddamnit claire i fucking told you this was a bad idea she rolled her eyes were fine well just split up and pick a corridor each and when we find it we will meet back here youre kidding there is no fucking way im splitting up down here i couldnt believe how casual she was being come on bailey nothing bad ever happens to girls who split up in creepy tunnels she teased she caught my look of disapproval and she sighed okay fine we will explore together i let out a sigh of relief i couldnt tell if she was joking the whole time she spun in a circle with her arm out and finger pointed and stopped on a random corridor this one i rubbed my face with my hands sure she started down the hallway and after some internal debate i followed where do you think these all lead i asked tracing my hand along the grooves in the stone well this one leads to the sacrifice chamber aaaand the other leads to more sacrifice chambers i sighed im serious claire alright sorry just trying to lighten the mood eventually the hallway opened up into a small room it was an office complete with bookshelves lined with binders and an old wooden desk covered in paper and documents we found the office claire clicked her tongue shit i groaned shining my light on the documents splayed out on the table they were mostly receipts corporate jargon that i couldnt understand some shipping manifestos claire pulled a binder off the shelf and opened it on the desk woah her eyes lit up i looked over her shoulder at the contents of the binder pages and pages of photo copies of peoples passport photos what the fuck i mouthed she flicked through the rest of the pages before closing it and grabbing another one the next binder was filled with more photos is this all the people from the church maybe claire ventured sliding out a random photo and flipping it over richard milson she continued reading the name on the back written in black ink ddo you think they killed these people my voice came out hoarse yeah she said grinning maybe they were all murdered im being serious i pushed her playfully i dont know she shrugged whatever reason though its still creepy as hell she pushed me back laughing well i dont know about you but im keen to get the hell out of here i muttered are you kidding claire closed the binder weve hit the jackpot we cant bail now claire seriously its dangerous down here we need to find the way out and head back i tried to command some urgency into my voice ooh kay she sighed crossing her arms gotta get home to your nice bed and your loving parents i get it oh come on dont put that bullshit on me you know thats not fair i argued back it was your idea to come down here at night i thought you were keeping track of the fucking directions in this fucking death trap her face twisted in disgust you know what youre such a perfect fucking grade a student find your own way out do you have a problem with me because you seem to be bringing up shit that isnt relevant to our fucking situation right now i yelled back our voices echoed loudly through the tunnels you have no idea how good you fucking have it do you claire was interrupted by a noise echoing from inside the tunnels what the fuck was that i spun towards the doorway breath ragged from the argument nothing it was probably just your complaining bouncing off the fucking ceiling claire pushed past me her eyes wet and stormed down the hallway her light bouncing around in the darkness god fucking damnit i yelled feeling my own tears streaming down my cheeks claire wait please i called after her heart racing not wanting to lose her in the darkness whats wrong too scared to find your own way out she yelled over her shoulder her light disappeared ahead and i picked up the pace trying to catch up claire please wait i screamed after her terrified of being alone i ran out into the atrium and it was completely empty my breaths were fast and my heart was racing claire please dont leave me here please i called out trying to listen for her i knelt down sobbing into my arms feeling completely alone in the dark silence being interrupted by my hitching sobs im sorry please im sorry i was so desperate for her to come back i wouldve done anything i sat there in the dark for minutes trying to regulate my breathing listening for any clues to which direction she went in bailey my head shot up hearing claires voice echo from a corridor claire claire i jumped up please claire where are you after a pause her voice called out again seemingly from everywhere bailey help claire please keep talking so i can find you i called out nose still running bailey please help her voice called out again and i thought i could hear it coming from my left there were three passageways it could have been though and the way her voice echoed i couldnt be sure i picked the middle corridor and took off sprinting down the passageway my light barely illuminated the space in front of me claire im coming i called out again i came to the end of the corridor and into a much bigger room it was another corridor with rows of doors on the left and right claire my voice cracked silence i thought i might have taken the wrong passageway until something slammed against the inside of one of the doors i screamed falling back startled by the sudden noise claire i called out again stop fucking around and come out a shiver ran down my spine when i heard her voice again bailey let me out please claires voice came from the other side of the door ddid you accidentally lock yourself in i asked into the darkness my breathing was ragged and i couldnt hear anything over my heart thumping in my ears i slowly climbed to my feet and crept towards the door a low soft crying noise came from the inside of one of the rooms i hesitated at the doorway and pressed my ear against it bailey im sorry please let me out claires voice came directly from the other side of the door my hand closed around the lock on the brass handle of the door i hesitated waiting for an excuse not to open it i squeezed my eyes shut and unlocked the door stepping back and shining my light after a few seconds the handle twisted slowly and the door swung inwards with a long drawn out groan i swallowed hard cclaire silence fell over the hallway my light shook in my hands as i tried to keep it steady on the doorway my heart dropped as a face slowly peered out from the doorway long matted black hair and a pale face with huge pupils peered out revealing a gaping mouth with no teeth i couldnt move i couldnt even scream i was completely frozen in fear staring in horror as it slowly slunk out of the room thin frail hands crept over its face shielding it from my light it screamed ear piercing guttural a noise that shot me into action i turned and sprinted down the hallway screaming absolute terror filling my body adrenaline surging through me i could hear something running behind me bare feet slapping against the floor i burst out into the atrium and picked a random tunnel and ran down it hoping to lose whatever the fuck was chasing me i came out in another room i barely registered any details of the room just running towards a door partially open it led down a set of stairs and i hurried down it careful not to fall the smell hit me as soon as i hit the end of the staircase i covered my mouth and nose retching violently the room smelt of rot meat and shit literal shit i raised my flashlight to illuminate the space the floor was stained red and black and covering the walls were smears of what looked and smelt of blood and shit i gagged and puked all over my feet i dry retched again too scared to go back up the stairs but unable to stay in the room any longer i scanned the room for any other way out but was only met with more bodily fluid smeared walls i couldnt take it the smell was making my vision double i ran back up the stairs i slowly crept back through the door scanning the room with the light before entering i couldnt see the creature anywhere and i crept further inside the room had a wooden table stained a deep red with a bucket and a large plastic container underneath i looked in the container for a weapon but found only old wallets car keys and some random crap that looked as if a bunch of people had emptied their pockets inside it i heard something from far off in the tunnels and i stopped going completely silent and still listening to hear if it was coming towards me when it went silent i took a deep breath saying a silent prayer and continuing to look my eyes landed on a metal fireplace poker and i lunged for it picking it up and holding it close to me i felt a little better having some kind of weapon but the knowledge id have to venture back down the hallway to get out was so terrifying i wondered if id ever leave i felt tears on my cheeks again and a lump caught in my throat i had the overwhelming sense of guilt remembering that claire was down here with me and id accidentally released something and it was probably going after her now i decided that i had to do something even if the thing killed me i had to save claire hesitating for another moment i squeezed the fireplace poker cold in my hands and went back down the hallway i held it out in front of me feeling the weight of it in my hand the main atrium was empty and the silence was deafening i spun

can find you i called out nose still running bailey please help her voice called out again and i thought i could hear it coming from my left there were three passageways it could have been though and the way her voice echoed i couldnt be sure i picked the middle corridor and took off sprinting down the passageway my light barely illuminated the space in front of me claire im coming i called out again i came to the end of the corridor and into a much bigger room it was another corridor with rows of doors on the left and right claire my voice cracked silence i thought i might have taken the wrong passageway until something slammed against the inside of one of the doors i screamed falling back startled by the sudden noise claire i called out again stop fucking around and come out a shiver ran down my spine when i heard her voice again bailey let me out please claires voice came from the other side of the door ddid you accidentally lock yourself in i asked into the darkness my breathing was ragged and i couldnt hear anything over my heart thumping in my ears i slowly climbed to my feet and crept towards the door a low soft crying noise came from the inside of one of the rooms i hesitated at the doorway and pressed my ear against it bailey im sorry please let me out claires voice came directly from the other side of the door my hand closed around the lock on the brass handle of the door i hesitated waiting for an excuse not to open it i squeezed my eyes shut and unlocked the door stepping back and shining my light after a few seconds the handle twisted slowly and the door swung inwards with a long drawn out groan i swallowed hard cclaire silence fell over the hallway my light shook in my hands as i tried to keep it steady on the doorway my heart dropped as a face slowly peered out from the doorway long matted black hair and a pale face with huge pupils peered out revealing a gaping mouth with no teeth i couldnt move i couldnt even scream i was completely frozen in fear staring in horror as it slowly slunk out of the room thin frail hands crept over its face shielding it from my light it screamed ear piercing guttural a noise that shot me into action i turned and sprinted down the hallway screaming absolute terror filling my body adrenaline surging through me i could hear something running behind me bare feet slapping against the floor i burst out into the atrium and picked a random tunnel and ran down it hoping to lose whatever the fuck was chasing me i came out in another room i barely registered any details of the room just running towards a door partially open it led down a set of stairs and i hurried down it careful not to fall the smell hit me as soon as i hit the end of the staircase i covered my mouth and nose retching violently the room smelt of rot meat and shit literal shit i raised my flashlight to illuminate the space the floor was stained red and black and covering the walls were smears of what looked and smelt of blood and shit i gagged and puked all over my feet i dry retched again too scared to go back up the stairs but unable to stay in the room any longer i scanned the room for any other way out but was only met with more bodily fluid smeared walls i couldnt take it the smell was making my vision double i ran back up the stairs i slowly crept back through the door scanning the room with the light before entering i couldnt see the creature anywhere and i crept further inside the room had a wooden table stained a deep red with a bucket and a large plastic container underneath i looked in the container for a weapon but found only old wallets car keys and some random crap that looked as if a bunch of people had emptied their pockets inside it i heard something from far off in the tunnels and i stopped going completely silent and still listening to hear if it was coming towards me when it went silent i took a deep breath saying a silent prayer and continuing to look my eyes landed on a metal fireplace poker and i lunged for it picking it up and holding it close to me i felt a little better having some kind of weapon but the knowledge id have to venture back down the hallway to get out was so terrifying i wondered if id ever leave i felt tears on my cheeks again and a lump caught in my throat i had the overwhelming sense of guilt remembering that claire was down here with me and id accidentally released something and it was probably going after her now i decided that i had to do something even if the thing killed me i had to save claire hesitating for another moment i squeezed the fireplace poker cold in my hands and went back down the hallway i held it out in front of me feeling the weight of it in my hand the main atrium was empty and the silence was deafening i spun slowly in the middle swinging my light trying to look down the hallways my heart thumped in my ears and i picked another corridor at random creeping down it poker raised i made it halfway down the corridor when i heard something scream behind me the same ear piercing cry that would haunt me the rest of my life i screamed too taking off sprinting to the end of the corridor i heard the bare feet slapping behind me closer and closer i screamed louder pure fear and terror pumping through me i ran straight into something cold and hard my hands closed around it the rungs of the ladder i wasnt even afforded a sigh of relief hearing the thing closing in right behind me i threw myself up the ladder phone barely hanging on in one hand and trying to hold on to the poker in the other my hands were greasy with sweat and occasionally they would slip off the rungs the ladder shifted below me creaking and groaning as the thing seemingly climbed after me the poker slid out of my hand and i heard it hit something with a wet thump the climb felt endless pure panic being the only thing driving me upwards i finally came out into the closet pulling myself up desperately still sobbing i pushed the heavy concrete slab back over the hole still crying i backed away from it before sprinting through the church and out into the cold night air hey you took your time claires voice came from beside the doors she was leaning against the wall clicking her lighter on and off a mixture of fear guilt and rage washed over me and i broke down crying falling into her arms she stood there stunned i couldnt speak i couldnt even form coherent sentences i just sobbed right into her jacket for a minute oh shit bailey are you good you smell awful she nervously patted my back i lifted my head snot and tears covering her jacket we need to go now i cried alright alright what the fuck did you see down there dude i yanked her arm and we climbed back up the hill the entire way back through the forest she wouldnt stop asking me questions i ignored them and pulled her back through the trees making her guide the way she walked me back home my heart dropped as we stood at the end of the street blue and red flashing lights illuminated my house i ran to the door claire stayed at the end of the street i burst through into the living room where my parents were sat holding each other mom crying as a policeman sat across from them as soon as they saw me they rushed over and wrapped me in a hug i cried again harder than i ever had before harder than i thought possible so hard that no noise came out as if the pressure in my head would make my eyes explode they had called the police soon after i snuck out id been gone three and a half hours i struggled to figure out what to tell the police eventually landing on a convincing lie that i had gotten lost in the forest my parents knew i had been with claire and i didnt care i never spoke to her again after that night i ignored her at school and after a few days she understood and left me alone to this day i still have nightmares about that church and whatever the fuck is happening beneath it",
    "my friend and i found the abandoned church behind our town behind our town is a massive hill stretching out either side with a forest of thick cedar trees at its edge theres a rumour of an old church hidden behind it and its said that inside is a fountain that has special powers its more of an old wives tale that gets passed around the town that night my friend and i decided we were going to find it how the hell are you going to sneak out your parents are super strict claire said resting her chin in her palm i dont know probably just quietly through the back door i shrugged and if they find out youre gone youre going to be grounded for a month again she drummed her fingers lightly on the bench well we could go during the day i said rolling my eyes thats no fun claire said with a playful glint in her eyes what about your parents i tiptoed around the question what about them her nose wrinkled in distaste i leaned in well how are you going to sneak out she tilted her head slightly eyes fixed on the ground unfocused theyll be too drunk to notice i doubt they will even know im home to begin with she tugged at her jacket sleeves trying to pull them over her hands where do we meet her lips curled into a smile the old highway sign in front of the hill the bell for next period rang out and i slung my backpack over my shoulder what time i asked as she dragged her satchel off the seat eleven she narrowed her eyes grinning that night at the dinner table my dad sighed picking at his food i got a call from your english teacher today his eyes shifted to me what did she say i kept my head down youre falling behind homework and studies he glanced at my mom yeah sorry i its that friend of yours clara my dad interrupted shoving food into his mouth claire i pushed food around my plate whatever her name is shes a bad influence on you i mean ive never seen her or her parents at church unless theyre going for the food drive he was starting to raise his voice charles my mom scolded him all im saying is he put his knife and fork down your goal is to get good grades so you can get into a good college and make something of yourself thats all me and your mother want for you noted i grunted maybe if her father didnt beat his daughter so much shed be as bright as you he muttered my face felt hot i clenched my fists charles thats enough my mom said her words short and sharp i stood up pushing the chair away and storming upstairs my dad called out to me but i ignored him i ran up the stairs and into my room slamming the door my phone buzzed claire hey i snuck out early can we meet soon i could still feel the anger burning yeah i slid the phone into my pocket threw my jacket on and opened my window pushing the mesh off i carefully slid out and put it back down the roof creaked as i crept down it careful not to slip or make any noise my knees screamed as i dropped into the back yard i glanced at the kitchen window and heard my parents arguing i ducked into the bushes then climbed over the fence into the alleyway next to our house and jogged towards the hill my jacket did little against the cold night air it took me about ten minutes of walking to get to the sign just outside of town claire was standing beneath it smoking the dim light of the embers illuminated her face softly in the dark is that a cigarette i asked approaching the sign uh yeah she held it out to me i caught her gaze and she looked away no thanks i said as casually as possible i stole it from my dad he was being a dick and i needed it she took a long drag before dropping it and stomping it out i stood there for a moment thinking about what my dad had said shall we she gestured towards the hill yyeah i murmured we climbed the hill stopping occasionally to catch our breath at the top we could see the forest stretch out tall dense trees crowded for miles i felt my phone vibrate in my pocket i pulled it out and saw it was my dad i clicked the phone off and slid it back into my pocket your dad know youre gone claire said looking over at me he does now i sighed arent you worried about getting grounded her voice pushed clouds into the cold air fuck em i said kicking a rock down the hill claire smiled as if i had said something she had been thinking for a while we set off into the forest using our phones as flashlights did we take into account that there might not be a church i ventured shining my light around in the darkness well its a nice night for a walk in the forest claire laughed do you know who youre taking to the winter prom she teased my face felt warm oh uh i probably wont go i said stumbling my words oh yeah pssh me neither claire said laughing nervously and throwing a rock she had picked up a moment of silence fell over us as we pushed further in i hope you remember the way back out i said half joking half worried that she might not have been paying attention i thought you were keeping track she said turning to look at me my face dropped her lips curled into a smile im fucking with you ive been mapping it i let out a sigh and laughed fuck you dud my foot snagged on a tree root and i went tumbling down a hill claire called my name running down after me i hit something hard at the bottom a wall ah fuck i groaned grabbing my side in pain claire ran to my side helping me sit up are you okay dude that looked like it hurt i clenched my jaw im okay im fine she stood up and took a few steps back oh shit her voice trailed off i stood up slowly and turned to face where she was looking the church white clapboard siding though the paint had long since started peeling and graying in the damp climate the steeple rose up its oxidized copper roof catching the beam of my light in a dull orange glow the pine forest pressed close on every side of the building the double doors sat partially open fuck my words caught in my throat me and claire exchanged looks before she took a deep breath and stepped towards it she pressed on one of the doors pushing it inwards and creeping inside i hesitated looking around the forest before finally entering behind her the inside was overgrown with trees growing through the broken windows grass and weeds were pushing through the floorboards there was a damp smell that hung in the air rot and earth and something older this is creepy as hell claire whispered walking down the aisle looking up at the ceiling i followed behind her looking between the pews they were all either warped broken or flipped over well uh i dont see a fountain anywhere claire clicked her tongue stopping at the altar i paced over to a closet and pulled the door open dust exploded outwards sending me into a coughing fit i shone my light inside revealing old robes some bibles stacked lazily in the corner and a large concrete slab hey claire check this out i called over to her she walked over peeking inside spooky she said touching the robe with her fingers no dude look i pointed at the slab now were talking she grinned cmon help me move it we pulled it out dragging it along the floorboards underneath was a round hole with a passageway that led down a rusted metal ladder disappeared into the dark fuck i dont know if i want to go down there i said nervously shining my light down the hole claire bit her lip deep in thought before looking at me and grinning see you on the other side before i could react she began climbing down the ladder it creaked and groaned as she descended fuck i muttered under my breath climbing down after her the air grew heavier as i descended the ladder didnt feel stable at all and i was worried it would break at any moment my palms were slick against the cold metal rungs it was a long way down taking about a minute to reach the bottom the hole opened up into a hallway made of stone claire was waiting at the bottom shining her light around the small space i wasnt typically a claustrophobic person but the walls seemed to squeeze inwards the ceiling was low enough that i had to duck my head slightly the stone was damp to the touch lets find this fountain hey claire murmured claire wait i replied this seems dangerous she turned awkwardly shifting to fit her shoulders in the small space well be okay she flashed a reassuring smile i didnt feel very reassured what if we get hurt down here i asked trying to keep her from continuing down the corridor she just rolled her eyes and smiled cmon you worry too much i took a breath and followed her reluctantly the hallway stretched on our footsteps echoed strangely against the stone the beam from my phone light seemed weaker down here swallowed by the dark before it could reach very far finally the corridor opened into a kind of atrium a circular room with corridors branching off in multiple directions now this is cool claire laughed in disbelief i had to admit i was pretty impressed i paced around the room slowly the stone walls were smooth almost polished there were markings carved into them worn too smooth to read what do you think they used this for i asked shining my light around probably for sacrificing people i laughed nervously well thank fuck its abandoned claire turned her head to look at me that we know of the air was thick and heavy the atrium was completely silent so silent i could hear my heartbeat in my ears so silent i could hear claire breathing beside me well claire spun around lets pick a corridor i guess wait my heart dropped what corridor did we enter from oh it was she turned and ran her tongue over her teeth in thought she pursed her lips we might be fucked i threw my hands in the air goddamnit claire i fucking told you this was a bad idea she rolled her eyes were fine well just split up and pick a corridor each and when we find it we will meet back here youre kidding there is no fucking way im splitting up down here i couldnt believe how casual she was being come on bailey nothing bad ever happens to girls who split up in creepy tunnels she teased she caught my look of disapproval and she sighed okay fine we will explore together i let out a sigh of relief i couldnt tell if she was joking the whole time she spun in a circle with her arm out and finger pointed and stopped on a random corridor this one i rubbed my face with my hands sure she started down the hallway and after some internal debate i followed where do you think these all lead i asked tracing my hand along the grooves in the stone well this one leads to the sacrifice chamber aaaand the other leads to more sacrifice chambers i sighed im serious claire alright sorry just trying to lighten the mood eventually the hallway opened up into a small room it was an office complete with bookshelves lined with binders and an old wooden desk covered in paper and documents we found the office claire clicked her tongue shit i groaned shining my light on the documents splayed out on the table they were mostly receipts corporate jargon that i couldnt understand some shipping manifestos claire pulled a binder off the shelf and opened it on the desk woah her eyes lit up i looked over her shoulder at the contents of the binder pages and pages of photo copies of peoples passport photos what the fuck i mouthed she flicked through the rest of the pages before closing it and grabbing another one the next binder was filled with more photos is this all the people from the church maybe claire ventured sliding out a random photo and flipping it over richard milson she continued reading the name on the back written in black ink ddo you think they killed these people my voice came out hoarse yeah she said grinning maybe they were all murdered im being serious i pushed her playfully i dont know she shrugged whatever reason though its still creepy as hell she pushed me back laughing well i dont know about you but im keen to get the hell out of here i muttered are you kidding claire closed the binder weve hit the jackpot we cant bail now claire seriously its dangerous down here we need to find the way out and head back i tried to command some urgency into my voice ooh kay she sighed crossing her arms gotta get home to your nice bed and your loving parents i get it oh come on dont put that bullshit on me you know thats not fair i argued back it was your idea to come down here at night i thought you were keeping track of the fucking directions in this fucking death trap her face twisted in disgust you know what youre such a perfect fucking grade a student find your own way out do you have a problem with me because you seem to be bringing up shit that isnt relevant to our fucking situation right now i yelled back our voices echoed loudly through the tunnels you have no idea how good you fucking have it do you claire was interrupted by a noise echoing from inside the tunnels what the fuck was that i spun towards the doorway breath ragged from the argument nothing it was probably just your complaining bouncing off the fucking ceiling claire pushed past me her eyes wet and stormed down the hallway her light bouncing around in the darkness god fucking damnit i yelled feeling my own tears streaming down my cheeks claire wait please i called after her heart racing not wanting to lose her in the darkness whats wrong too scared to find your own way out she yelled over her shoulder her light disappeared ahead and i picked up the pace trying to catch up claire please wait i screamed after her terrified of being alone i ran out into the atrium and it was completely empty my breaths were fast and my heart was racing claire please dont leave me here please i called out trying to listen for her i knelt down sobbing into my arms feeling completely alone in the dark silence being interrupted by my hitching sobs im sorry please im sorry i was so desperate for her to come back i wouldve done anything i sat there in the dark for minutes trying to regulate my breathing listening for any clues to which direction she went in bailey my head shot up hearing claires voice echo from a corridor claire claire i jumped up please claire where are you after a pause her voice called out again seemingly from everywhere bailey help claire please keep talking so i

weaker down here swallowed by the dark before it could reach very far finally the corridor opened into a kind of atrium a circular room with corridors branching off in multiple directions now this is cool claire laughed in disbelief i had to admit i was pretty impressed i paced around the room slowly the stone walls were smooth almost polished there were markings carved into them worn too smooth to read what do you think they used this for i asked shining my light around probably for sacrificing people i laughed nervously well thank fuck its abandoned claire turned her head to look at me that we know of the air was thick and heavy the atrium was completely silent so silent i could hear my heartbeat in my ears so silent i could hear claire breathing beside me well claire spun around lets pick a corridor i guess wait my heart dropped what corridor did we enter from oh it was she turned and ran her tongue over her teeth in thought she pursed her lips we might be fucked i threw my hands in the air goddamnit claire i fucking told you this was a bad idea she rolled her eyes were fine well just split up and pick a corridor each and when we find it we will meet back here youre kidding there is no fucking way im splitting up down here i couldnt believe how casual she was being come on bailey nothing bad ever happens to girls who split up in creepy tunnels she teased she caught my look of disapproval and she sighed okay fine we will explore together i let out a sigh of relief i couldnt tell if she was joking the whole time she spun in a circle with her arm out and finger pointed and stopped on a random corridor this one i rubbed my face with my hands sure she started down the hallway and after some internal debate i followed where do you think these all lead i asked tracing my hand along the grooves in the stone well this one leads to the sacrifice chamber aaaand the other leads to more sacrifice chambers i sighed im serious claire alright sorry just trying to lighten the mood eventually the hallway opened up into a small room it was an office complete with bookshelves lined with binders and an old wooden desk covered in paper and documents we found the office claire clicked her tongue shit i groaned shining my light on the documents splayed out on the table they were mostly receipts corporate jargon that i couldnt understand some shipping manifestos claire pulled a binder off the shelf and opened it on the desk woah her eyes lit up i looked over her shoulder at the contents of the binder pages and pages of photo copies of peoples passport photos what the fuck i mouthed she flicked through the rest of the pages before closing it and grabbing another one the next binder was filled with more photos is this all the people from the church maybe claire ventured sliding out a random photo and flipping it over richard milson she continued reading the name on the back written in black ink ddo you think they killed these people my voice came out hoarse yeah she said grinning maybe they were all murdered im being serious i pushed her playfully i dont know she shrugged whatever reason though its still creepy as hell she pushed me back laughing well i dont know about you but im keen to get the hell out of here i muttered are you kidding claire closed the binder weve hit the jackpot we cant bail now claire seriously its dangerous down here we need to find the way out and head back i tried to command some urgency into my voice ooh kay she sighed crossing her arms gotta get home to your nice bed and your loving parents i get it oh come on dont put that bullshit on me you know thats not fair i argued back it was your idea to come down here at night i thought you were keeping track of the fucking directions in this fucking death trap her face twisted in disgust you know what youre such a perfect fucking grade a student find your own way out do you have a problem with me because you seem to be bringing up shit that isnt relevant to our fucking situation right now i yelled back our voices echoed loudly through the tunnels you have no idea how good you fucking have it do you claire was interrupted by a noise echoing from inside the tunnels what the fuck was that i spun towards the doorway breath ragged from the argument nothing it was probably just your complaining bouncing off the fucking ceiling claire pushed past me her eyes wet and stormed down the hallway her light bouncing around in the darkness god fucking damnit i yelled feeling my own tears streaming down my cheeks claire wait please i called after her heart racing not wanting to lose her in the darkness whats wrong too scared to find your own way out she yelled over her shoulder her light disappeared ahead and i picked up the pace trying to catch up claire please wait i screamed after her terrified of being alone i ran out into the atrium and it was completely empty my breaths were fast and my heart was racing claire please dont leave me here please i called out trying to listen for her i knelt down sobbing into my arms feeling completely alone in the dark silence being interrupted by my hitching sobs im sorry please im sorry i was so desperate for her to come back i wouldve done anything i sat there in the dark for minutes trying to regulate my breathing listening for any clues to which direction she went in bailey my head shot up hearing claires voice echo from a corridor claire claire i jumped up please claire where are you after a pause her voice called out again seemingly from everywhere bailey help claire please keep talking so i can find you i called out nose still running bailey please help her voice called out again and i thought i could hear it coming from my left there were three passageways it could have been though and the way her voice echoed i couldnt be sure i picked the middle corridor and took off sprinting down the passageway my light barely illuminated the space in front of me claire im coming i called out again i came to the end of the corridor and into a much bigger room it was another corridor with rows of doors on the left and right claire my voice cracked silence i thought i might have taken the wrong passageway until something slammed against the inside of one of the doors i screamed falling back startled by the sudden noise claire i called out again stop fucking around and come out a shiver ran down my spine when i heard her voice again bailey let me out please claires voice came from the other side of the door ddid you accidentally lock yourself in i asked into the darkness my breathing was ragged and i couldnt hear anything over my heart thumping in my ears i slowly climbed to my feet and crept towards the door a low soft crying noise came from the inside of one of the rooms i hesitated at the doorway and pressed my ear against it bailey im sorry please let me out claires voice came directly from the other side of the door my hand closed around the lock on the brass handle of the door i hesitated waiting for an excuse not to open it i squeezed my eyes shut and unlocked the door stepping back and shining my light after a few seconds the handle twisted slowly and the door swung inwards with a long drawn out groan i swallowed hard cclaire silence fell over the hallway my light shook in my hands as i tried to keep it steady on the doorway my heart dropped as a face slowly peered out from the doorway long matted black hair and a pale face with huge pupils peered out revealing a gaping mouth with no teeth i couldnt move i couldnt even scream i was completely frozen in fear staring in horror as it slowly slunk out of the room thin frail hands crept over its face shielding it from my light it screamed ear piercing guttural a noise that shot me into action i turned and sprinted down the hallway screaming absolute terror filling my body adrenaline surging through me i could hear something running behind me bare feet slapping against the floor i burst out into the atrium and picked a random tunnel and ran down it hoping to lose whatever the fuck was chasing me i came out in another room i barely registered any details of the room just running towards a door partially open it led down a set of stairs and i hurried down it careful not to fall the smell hit me as soon as i hit the end of the staircase i covered my mouth and nose retching violently the room smelt of rot meat and shit literal shit i raised my flashlight to illuminate the space the floor was stained red and black and covering the walls were smears of what looked and smelt of blood and shit i gagged and puked all over my feet i dry retched again too scared to go back up the stairs but unable to stay in the room any longer i scanned the room for any other way out but was only met with more bodily fluid smeared walls i couldnt take it the smell was making my vision double i ran back up the stairs i slowly crept back through the door scanning the room with the light before entering i couldnt see the creature anywhere and i crept further inside the room had a wooden table stained a deep red with a bucket and a large plastic container underneath i looked in the container for a weapon but found only old wallets car keys and some random crap that looked as if a bunch of people had emptied their pockets inside it i heard something from far off in the tunnels and i stopped going completely silent and still listening to hear if it was coming towards me when it went silent i took a deep breath saying a silent prayer and continuing to look my eyes landed on a metal fireplace poker and i lunged for it picking it up and holding it close to me i felt a little better having some kind of weapon but the knowledge id have to venture back down the hallway to get out was so terrifying i wondered if id ever leave i felt tears on my cheeks again and a lump caught in my throat i had the overwhelming sense of guilt remembering that claire was down here with me and id accidentally released something and it was probably going after her now i decided that i had to do something even if the thing killed me i had to save claire hesitating for another moment i squeezed the fireplace poker cold in my hands and went back down the hallway i held it out in front of me feeling the weight of it in my hand the main atrium was empty and the silence was deafening i spun slowly in the middle swinging my light trying to look down the hallways my heart thumped in my ears and i picked another corridor at random creeping down it poker raised i made it halfway down the corridor when i heard something scream behind me the same ear piercing cry that would haunt me the rest of my life i screamed too taking off sprinting to the end of the corridor i heard the bare feet slapping behind me closer and closer i screamed louder pure fear and terror pumping through me i ran straight into something cold and hard my hands closed around it the rungs of the ladder i wasnt even afforded a sigh of relief hearing the thing closing in right behind me i threw myself up the ladder phone barely hanging on in one hand and trying to hold on to the poker in the other my hands were greasy with sweat and occasionally they would slip off the rungs the ladder shifted below me creaking and groaning as the thing seemingly climbed after me the poker slid out of my hand and i heard it hit something with a wet thump the climb felt endless pure panic being the only thing driving me upwards i finally came out into the closet pulling myself up desperately still sobbing i pushed the heavy concrete slab back over the hole still crying i backed away from it before sprinting through the church and out into the cold night air hey you took your time claires voice came from beside the doors she was leaning against the wall clicking her lighter on and off a mixture of fear guilt and rage washed over me and i broke down crying falling into her arms she stood there stunned i couldnt speak i couldnt even form coherent sentences i just sobbed right into her jacket for a minute oh shit bailey are you good you smell awful she nervously patted my back i lifted my head snot and tears covering her jacket we need to go now i cried alright alright what the fuck did you see down there dude i yanked her arm and we climbed back up the hill the entire way back through the forest she wouldnt stop asking me questions i ignored them and pulled her back through the trees making her guide the way she walked me back home my heart dropped as we stood at the end of the street blue and red flashing lights illuminated my house i ran to the door claire stayed at the end of the street i burst through into the living room where my parents were sat holding each other mom crying as a policeman sat across from them as soon as they saw me they rushed over and wrapped me in a hug i cried again harder than i ever had before harder than i thought possible so hard that no noise came out as if the pressure in my head would make my eyes explode they had called the police soon after i snuck out id been gone three and a half hours i struggled to figure out what to tell the police eventually landing on a convincing lie that i had gotten lost in the forest my parents knew i had been with claire and i didnt care i never spoke to her again after that night i ignored her at school and after a few days she understood and left me alone to this day i still have nightmares about that church and whatever the fuck is happening beneath it",

    "helping my partner mtf be ascomfortable in female spaces as possible hello all lost cis partner looking for help my mtf partner came out to me about 8 months ago started hrt pretty immediately and began exploring clothing options weve recently had more in depth conversations and she wants to make sure she makes other women feel comfortable in women only spaces now i feel like we shouldnt be too heavily concerned about the comfort of likely bigoted strangers but i know this issue is a sensitive one and needs to be handled with care as her livelihood is on the line some things to note she is a taller broader person broad shouldered 6ft plus squared face still very masculine shes buying feminine clothing but imagine sweaters library like and flannel clothing nothing hyper feminine but id say more mature and subtle hrt has given her only minor breast growth right now and she usually wears a padded sports bra nothing extreme or hyper obvious im seeking advice into how i can make her more comfortable inching her way into womens spaces we havent attempted a restroom yet and stupidly im not knowledgeable in the moment in thinking of other women focused areas i personally know jack about makeup specifically things like contouring im a very much goth girly and if she wants a pale dark eyed look im her gal but outside of pretty basic and specific stuff im useless does anyone have any good resources that could teach either of us or brands that you value id also happily hear what your stories are and how your partners began entering these spaces or if those partners are here please speak up what steps did you take what made you feel more confident and secure im looking into more woman oriented events not specifically women only i guess but that are often things women tend to do theres a local winery that does a lot is this a direction youd head in ill happily take suggestions just a clueless woman here who has never had to consider this situation forgive my ignorance",
    "we need balance in the way feminism is portrayed in tamil cinema yess this is about aan paavam kolladhu theres already growing hostility toward women in our society especially in tamil circles slutshaming mocking and dismissing womens experiences is extremely normalized so when a movie like aan paavam kolladhu chooses to focus on pseudo feminismit kinda feels less like critique and more like propaganda because it plays directly into that existing bias yes misuse of feminism exists it can be discussed but these movies usually exaggerate it to the extreme showing women as manipulative selfish and treating men only as financial providers while the man is shown as traditional loving and victimized it becomes a very convenient narrative of see this is what feminism really is and thats simply not the truth what makes it more frustrating is this name one recent tamil movie that has genuinely explored real feminism womens empowerment or womens experiences in a nuanced way not seeing there arent any but anytime a movie does attempt that people are the first to dismiss it as too preachy antimenor not relatable but when a film reinforces the stereotype that women are manipulative or evil suddenly its considered realistic and it just reaffirms the ideologies of incels if there was a balance and if we had equal representation of womens stories struggles and perspectives then a critique of pseudo feminism would make sense but right now we barely get any space for real feminist narratives and yet we keep getting movies that put women down another issue is how well people receive and perceive these movies as opposed to feminist movies that are usually perceived like women doing whatever they want and calling it empowerment calling out misuse of feminism only makes sense when real feminism is also represented and perceived right right now the scales arent balanced and that imbalance affects how audiences think",
    "hot take no im not a sociopath just because i took your loot edit first off thanks to everyone whos actually reading this wall of text and having a real discussion to the folks just commenting lol sociopath my post is about actions taken inside a fictional game context youre making a choice to post outside that context in a realworld discussion in a weird way youre just helping me prove my original point context is everything cheers i have to get this off my chest because i see it every single day in this sub yes you could ask why do you post about it then fair point i do it because i do not want to complain about it but moreover discuss on a factual basis someone posts about getting betrayed in arc raiders and like clockwork the comments fill up with people diagnosing the betrayer as a bad person a narcissist someone with no empathy or a shitty personality im not exaggerating people genuinely argue that if you rob a teammate you must be a fundamentally dishonest and manipulative person in real life i get it betrayal sucks its frustrating as hell and can make us emotional but this leap this armchair psychoanalysis its just wrong and the reason its wrong is actually pretty interesting heres the main problem were all wired with this bias its a real thing in psychology called the fundamental attribution error and its been studied for decades you can google it it basically means when we see someone do something our instant gut reaction is to think thats their personality we massively underestimate the situation or the context when someone cuts you off in traffic your first thought is asshole not maybe theyre rushing to the hospital in arc raiders this bias goes into overdrive you see someone betray your brain screams thats a bad person but everyones missing the most important piece of context its just a game its not real life its a space with a totally different set of rules before you go on with but here you also play against real human beings let me explain some things to show you why in a game it is totally different thing than treating people bad in real life think about it a game explicitly allows and even encourages behaviors that are unthinkable in real life when an actor plays a villain do you think theyre actually a villain of course not theyre playing a role within a system the script games are the same the stakes are digital you lose loot not your realworld reputation or your friendships theres even a classic framework for this bartles taxonomy that basically just says people play for different reasons some want to win some want to socialize some explore and some just want to compete and dominate that last type the killer type its a playstyle not a moral failing its just how they choose to engage with the games system another aspect is that people assume these players lack empathy honestly i think the opposite is often true the ability to separate your actions in a game from your realworld self isnt a sign of no empathy its a sign of flexible thinking its called compartmentalization you can feel a pang of guilt for betraying someone in a game and still do it because you know consciously or not that its not real and you will forget about it later because they were no real consequences or harm for the other person that little pang of guilt thats the empathy right there a true sociopath wouldnt feel anything at all they just understand the context im probably going to get flamed for this but heres my own situation ive done it all in arc raiders ive played friendly ive robbed people ive betrayed i like to experiment with the systems but in real life im the guy who regularly donates to charity im the one who actually stops to give money to homeless folks im known for being overly generous with gifts to the point where my friends tell me to chill im the reliable friend who never lies and always is clear about his opinion does my play style in a video game suddenly wipe all that out cmon ive got a buddy who plays dead by daylight hes an absolute monster according to some part of the dbd survivor community in that game tunnels camps gets the first surv out of the game asap all because hes fully focused on winning in real life hes genuinely one of the kindest most honest and empathetic people ive ever met is he a bad person or is he just playing a game its like people are just complex you know not onedimensional cartoon characters this whole armchair psychology thing is what really bothers me and yeah im not a psychologist but neither is 99 of this sub theres a name for this too the dunningkruger effect its that thing where people with limited knowledge in a subject like say clinical psychology confidently make huge claims not realizing they lack the expertise to even know what theyre getting wrong and i can already hear the response i bet if there were no laws or anarchy youd be the first person to kill someone my answer who knows maybe maybe not nobody knows how theyd act in some extreme hypothetical scenario until its real but a video game is definitely not the indicator for that speculating about it is just another useless highandmighty guess you cant diagnose someones entire moral character from a 10minute interaction in a video game thats not psychology moral behavior is contextual my realworld self operates under realworld rules my ingame self operates under game rules thats not hypocrisy thats being a normal complex human so heres what im asking can we please stop be mad about the betrayal rant about it thats fair but stop diagnosing people its inaccurate its unfair and honestly it just makes the community toxic people are complex someone can be a cutthroat competitor in a game and a genuinely good person in real life both things can be true we should be happy this game allows for such a huge spectrum of playstyles its what makes it stand out from its competitors its the reason you never know what will happen in the next match and thats exciting that unpredictability is a feature and not a bug lets let games be a space for experimentation not a jury box for our reallife morality ps im posting this from my real account one i use for private and business stuff im standing by this because i genuinely love this game and think the community is great but these constant subjective assumptions about peoples personalities arent just wrong theyre not healthy for the games community in the long run",
    "a story mode idea that ea could realistically do that fits alongside what they are currently doing with the game yes i had chatgpt format my thoughts the biggest thing missing from skate right now is any longterm progression the skating feels great but theres nothing to work toward older skate games had the goal of becoming a skate legend completing missions to sell boards and make a name for yourself this game doesnt need to copy that but it does need something that gives players purpose and direction without breaking the relaxed feel heres an idea that would give players something meaningful to build toward fits the freetoplay economy and adds some much needed immersion the premise you start as just a regular skater early on your friend or vee ugh basically says something like you can only skate for so long if you want to stay part of the scene forever you have to build something that lasts so instead of trying to be the best skater ever your longterm goal becomes to build your own skatepark and eventually turn it into a long term business the progression path you make money rip chips the same way you already play the game missions filming clips contests skate sessions with others just exploring but instead of spending that money only on cosmetic clothing you spend it on building up your skatepark which grows through several stages 1 backyard or alley diy spot a few ramps a box a rail very small start 2 a slightly larger local communitystyle park 3 a mediumsized spot where you can start hosting sessions 4 the final goal purchasing a large warehouse factory or industrial building and turning it into your dream skatepark every time you save up enough rip chips to move to the next location you basically start fresh rebuilding your park piecebypiece thats the meaningful progression you are actually building something that reflects your style and personality the end goal this is the important part once you finally build and complete your large warehouse skatepark it begins generating passive rip chips over time the idea is that the park becomes successful and starts supporting itself this gives you a reason to keep logging in income you can use to further upgrade and redesign the space the ability to shift your parks identity over time a personal home base in the world of skate location choice matters ea wouldnt have to let players build anywhere instead they could offer a few curated spot locations each with its own vibe and personality a clean modern warehouse in hedgemont a gritty industrial yard in gullcrest an old refabbed brick building in brickswitch a backyardstyle suburban area once the suburbs release each location encourages a different layout different skating style and different community vibe picking your location becomes a part of who you are in the game why this works with f2p without feeling gross the game is already structured around unlockable props rails ramps lights decor etc this gives all those items real meaning theyre not just random cosmetic junk you collect they become the building blocks of your skatepark",

    "wife confessed shes attracted to another woman realizes she might be bisexual weve been together 20 years and have 2 kids this was a bit of a shock realization but nothing i was honestly surprised about i could have told her and actually jokingly have i even knew her type i do trust she wouldnt cheat and she was upfront about her feelings shes taking it pretty shes overwhelmed but she says the thoughts are sexual intrusive exciting scary and present this is new territory for her and for us as a straight male its hard to know if the foundations shifted or if i need to share the sexual space in her mind and body not just this person per se but in general she says nothing has changed towards me or us or her attraction to me which i understand but its just scary as monogamy can have different perceived rules when it is to the prism of same gender attraction like it would be a non factor of it was a man but since its a woman we did discuss that the same rules apply regardless of gender she says this just feels different and im trying to sort out all of it so is she weve discussed boundaries and our respect for each other but im really just trying to grapple with the mental aspects of it all when i get a crush i enjoy that quick moment of realization and quietly back down and remove myself the sacrifice actually gives me joy to do it as its a reaffirmation of my love for her where i fit in and where this can realistically stay and go i have no plans to leave or do anything that doesnt support her i am strangely curious about this whole thing looking for any thoughts or experienced insight as how to handle process and be supportive i dont know if we redirect some of these fantasies into our sex life fantasy not reality and how do i help her explore this side of her without being intrusive or domineering or even being just present id like to try and do this from within our marriage but i dont know if that will smother her to try to take away the narrative she needs to build for herself and i need to figure out how i fit into all of this is it possible this does or doesnt change our marriage dynamic now and moving forward any experience or advice is welcome i know i cant be the first",
    "an in depth journey through various iems with tanchjim luna dacamp cs43198 focusing specifically on my audio journey with the iems i use daily i aim to describe the technical prowess of tanchjims luna and the changes in character that occur when paired with different headphones in a natural and fluid language i used iphone 14 pro max ipad pro m1 as a source in tests my goal is to transcend all previous reviews to convey my own feelings as a listener not as an operating system but through a human touch while the technical data will be solid ground the main narrative will be emotional and narrative the purpose of this article is not academic measurement but rather a personal perspective based on the listeners experience nevertheless the technical specifications you can use are listed below valid and accurate from these technical data we can conclude that the luna is both it offers a quiet base for low impedance iems and is designed to drive higher impedance headphones with balanced output lets explore the implications of this ample capacity when paired with different iems below pairing experiences below ill discuss the luna with the iems ive listed in separate sections each section will cover the gains achieved by pairing the changes in character and the how i felt when using this source with this iem 1 tanchjim fola the experience of pairing fola with arcanis was a journey seeking a bit more tonal color than with arcanis the combination of folas characteristic signature and lunas neutrality created the following sensations bass fola exhibited a bit more mid to upper bass intensity and luna brought this intensity to an organic form the bass didnt pop and disappear but it didnt overwhelm other frequencies mids folas midrange was more sensible in contrast luna didnt suppress this midrange feel but it did quieten the background creating a more vibrant image in front of the vocals trebles when fola and luna were paired the trebles became a bit softer in other words the smoothness of luna combined with folas gentle warmth created a generally nonfatiguing character suitable for long listening periods in other words this combination makes even difficult to accept recordings comfortable to listen to it was in the mood for example live recordings or vocal based tracks sounded more on point with the fola luna 2 tanchjim nora nora has a slightly different character so its pairing with luna also created a difference bass with the noraluna pairing the bass was a bit more in the background which was a bit of a challenge for some mid trebles noras sound signature can generally be described as highmid and treble oriented with a slight emphasis according to my own notes luna made nora more controlled with its power output in other words there was a feeling of treble light shining through but still bringing out the details this might be perceived as lacking bass by the user but i felt it was watchable but balanced soundstage width the lunas high dynamic range improves the soundstage width and when combined with the noras natural bias it creates a situation where the vocal is in the foreground and the surrounding atmosphere is felt broadly i was particularly pleased with the noraluna combination in jazz and vocalstring genres 3 ziigaat arcanis when i encountered the arcanis i was greeted with a transparency stemming from the lunas quiet base and powerful output authority the arcanis is an iem that stands out technically bass clean bass control a wide soundstage and good separation when paired with the luna i felt more freedom in the bass department the arcaniss low end control was already good but thanks to the luna the sub bass sensation became a bit smoother the bass is there but it doesnt overwhelm the environment the feeling intensified in other words the bass was more clearly separated midrange arcanis vocal and instrument tone was already pure and clear luna pushed background noise further here creating a feeling of voices hanging in the air female vocals were more present highs arcanis treble extension is good but with luna i felt an increase in shimmer in the treble but this increase was on the borderline comfortable i didnt feel like the treble was noticeable overall stage and dynamism thanks to lunas high dynamic range the arcanis stage became even more high and floating there was more space between the instruments making it easier to distinguish crowded recordings in short in the arcanis luna combination the technical aspect was at the forefront separation stage and detail guitar riffs symphonic strings multiinstrumental tracks each element seemed to be speaking in its own room 4 kiwi ears quartet the quartets character is a bit more bassleaning and switched heres what i noticed when using this iem with the luna bass the quartets bassfocused nature gained bass control when paired with the luna rather than increasing the bass in other words the bass became dynamic and clear midrange the quartet had a tendency to have bass in the front and midrange in the back the luna seemed to offset this trend somewhat and as a result i felt the mids were a bit more prominent but there wasnt a complete shift to neutral mids treble there was a slight tendency towards softening with the quartet overall but with the luna the highs became a bit clearer and the sparkle effect increased on some tracks the highs were a bit too visible for me if youre aiming for a bass heavy fun listening experience the quartet luna is quite enjoyable however for those looking for a reference level the mids could have been a bit more visible 5 bqeyz frost detailed reviews of the frosts character are limited but based on my own listening notes and the effect of the pairing the frost is a very responsive iem the lunas low impedance and quiet base advantage came into play here in other words the source sound feeling was intense bass thanks to the luna the clean controlled bass experience was achieved while frosts inherent nature isnt particularly bassoriented the bass line became more defined with the luna midrange frost luna delivered a combination that brought vocals closer live and concert recordings were impressive with this combination trebles i didnt notice any overly aggressive treble boost lunas neutrality provided a detailed treble presentation without creating too much sharpness in summary frost luna was a balanced yet characterful option for me 6 oriveti bleqk purecaster the lunas capabilities came to the forefront in a slightly different way when paired with the purecaster the purecaster is a more dynamic and expressive iem the luna toned down this emphasis maintaining the original sound signature while quieting the background bass the purecasters bass presentation was still vibrant but thanks to luna transitions with other frequencies were smoother reducing the overshadowing of other frequencies below the bass mids this combination increased the sense of closeness in the mids making vocals sound more resonant trebles the purecasters treble felt more balanced with the luna there was less fatigue over time the purecaster luna was a pairing that could be listened to all day long without sacrificing its character pros thanks to its powerful output capacity it performs well with both low impedance iems and more hard to drive headphones it provides a quiet base the perception of background noise is significantly reduced allowing for clearer details when paired correctly the stage width separation and transparency are enhanced technically its performance close to higherend measured values such as 132 db ar is reassuring it doesnt add excessive tonal color which is a positive aspect of keeping the source as pure as possible with other iems cons the bass level may not be as boom boom as expected when paired with some iems so for bass conscious users it might be a bit limited in terms of full bass the luna is balanced and does the job just right the highs can feel a bit too open ended when paired with some iems so users who are sensitive to highs should be cautious conclusion i think the tanchjim luna is a significant step forward for iem users looking to boost their source its technically sound and the differences it will make especially with iem pairings are quite significant however theres no guarantee that the magic will work every time its paired the iems character determines the sensitivity of the pairing if youre a listener like me meaning you want to boost your source and better express the potential of my iem but dont want it to change too much in tone the luna could be a very sensible choice if youre looking to hear more from your iems this is a great choice technical specifications dac chip dual cirrus logic 2xcs43198

    "oc we are coming we were not always as we are now masters of ten thousand suns harvesters of worlds the apex predator of a hostile galaxy once we too crawled in the mud of a single world beneath a single star ignorant of the vast darkness that waited beyond our methanethick atmosphere i remember the old stories passed down through the crystalline memorylattices of my forebears how we first united the disparate hives of our homeworld through cycles of conquest and assimilation each victory adding new strength to our collective the losers became nutrients for our growth their knowledge absorbed their weaknesses discarded this was the first truth we learned that power determines survival and survival is the only morality that matters our sciences bloomed in those early centuries like phosphorescent algae in the deep trenches of our world we unravelled the codes of life mapped the neural pathways of consciousness split the atom and harnessed its fury for a time we believed in the elegant theory of evolution that we had risen from simpler forms through endless generations of gradual change it was a comforting narrative suggesting progress was inevitable that we were always meant to achieve dominance but when we calculated the fixation rates when we modelled the probability cascades necessary for our emergence the mathematics shattered that illusion the numbers simply didnt work random mutation and selection could not account for our complexity not in the timeframe available not with the parameters we observed we had been designed engineered but by whom we searched our world for traces of a progenitor species some evidence of those who had seeded us here we excavated the ancient seabeds decoded mineralogical records stretching back billions of years launched expeditions to our worlds three moons nothing if creators had walked here they had left no footprint we could detect when we finally breached the membrane of our atmosphere and tasted the void between stars we thought surely we would find them among the distant suns our first colony ships massive cylinders of biometal and living tissue pushed through the cosmic dark powered by controlled singularities on a dozen worlds we found ruins but they were merely the bones of civilizations like ours younger than us in some cases older in others but all conventionally evolved all extinct by their own failures or cosmic accident none showed signs of being our makers in those early days of our expansion we believed the universe was uniform in all directions an endless expanse of galaxies rushing away from each other in the wake of some primordial explosion our scientists had mapped the cosmic microwave background traced the redshift of distant quasars built models showing how space itself was stretching like the membrane of some impossible balloon but when our ships pushed farther when we developed the technology to fold space and leap across thousands of lightyears in a single bound we discovered something that shook our understanding to its core the universe was not the same everywhere the farther we travelled from our region of space the older everything became older than should have been possible given our models and when we reversed our course moving inward rather than out everything grew younger denser more energetic we were not expanding into an infinite cosmos we were near the centre of something finite something with structure and purpose our galaxy the spinning disc of stars we called home sat at the heart of creation like a pearl within nested shells of space and time the implications were staggering if the universe had a centre it suggested intentionality design purpose the necessity of a creator became not a matter of faith but of logic as inevitable as the laws of thermodynamics yet this creator remained absent silent offering no guidance beyond the brutal arithmetic of existence itself of course without revelation without commandments carved in stone or whispered in dreams how were we to determine right from wrong we had long since abandoned the primitive notion that sentiment or empathy could serve as moral foundation feelings were mere chemical reactions evolutionary artefacts that had once helped small tribal groups cooperate they had no objective reality no universal truth but power power was real energy could be measured territory could be mapped resources could be counted the strong survived and the weak perished this was not opinion but observable fact repeated across every ecosystem we had ever studied and so we built our ethics on this foundation of granite rather than sand to expand was good for it increased our power to conquer was righteous for it proved our superiority to consume was sacred for it fuelled our growth space we learned was vast but not infinite in its bounty habitable worlds were jewels scattered across an ocean of radiation and vacuum most planets were barren rock or frozen gas their surfaces scoured by stellar winds or locked in perpetual ice life where it existed at all clung to narrow bands of temperature and chemistry fragile as frost patterns on glass we fought wars for those precious worlds great campaigns that lasted centuries and claimed billions of lives when we encountered other sapient species and they were few so heartbreakingly few we evaluated them by the only metric that mattered could they resist us those that could became temporary rivals to be guarded against just as they did to us those that couldnt became resources their worlds repurposed their populations harvested or eliminated as efficiency demanded i felt no guilt for this none of us did guilt requires the belief that there exists some higher standard by which our actions could be judged wrong but there is no such standard there was us and there was them our survival our expansion ourselves these were the only goods we acknowledged to show mercy to an enemy was not virtue but weakness not compassion but betrayal of our own kind our expansion followed the galaxys habitable zone that sweet band between the radiationsoaked core where ancient black holes fed on stellar matter and the cold rim where red dwarf stars flickered like dying embers in this fertile crescent we built our empire across a thousand systems each conquest adding to our collective strength each victory proving the righteousness of our cause for eight centuries we encountered few species that could challenge our dominance some fought with admirable ferocity others attempted negotiation or submission but all save the strongest eventually fell before our technological superiority and unified purpose we had begun to believe ourselves alone in any meaningful sense the only truly advanced civilisation in this galaxy perhaps in all of creation then we found the creature one of our deep reconnaissance vessels probing the edge of a stellar nursery two thousand parsecs from our nearest colony detected an artificial signature a small craft no larger than a personal transport moving through normal space at sublight velocity our initial scans suggested it was too small to carry a foldspace generator or any other fasterthanlight system we recognised yet here it was impossibly far from any known civilisation we disabled its engines with a focused pulse laser and brought it aboard the creature we found inside stood on two legs like some of the species we had encountered but there the resemblance ended its skin was dark brown almost black stretched over a bizarrely fragile endoskeletal frame it had only two eyes both facing forward and a small mouth filled with blunt teeth suited for an omnivorous diet most disturbing of all it was alone a single consciousness in a single body not part of any collective or hivemind we could detect the creature was conscious when we brought it to the examination chamber it spoke in a language our translation matrices had never encountered though they learned its sonic frequencies with surprising speed within three rotations we had established basic communication i am amharic kebede it said forming our sounds with its alien throat i am a man a human from earth man human earth new words for our lexicons new concepts to dissect through days of interrogation we extracted its story it claimed to be male one half of a sexually dimorphic species dependent on biological females for reproduction how inefficient we thought how vulnerable it said it came from something called the kingdom of ethiopia one of hundreds of political entities that controlled regions of space spanning nearly two thousand parsecs all populated by these humans you have never encountered others we asked no species but your own never amharic confirmed we thought ourselves alone we hoped otherwise but he gestured with his upper appendages in what we learned was a sign of uncertainty his ship fascinated our engineers the technology was impressively advanced its ability to fold space was much like our own but shrunk to a size we had not believed possible its defensive screens were far superior to any of our ships of equal mass yet it had no weapons not even a pulse laser amharic himself proved equally intriguing he claimed to be an explorer driven by something he called wanderlust a desire to see what lay beyond the next star to map the unmapped to know the unknown when we asked what practical purpose this served what advantage it gave his species he seemed confused by the question the journey itself is the purpose he said to see gods creation in all its glory to understand our place within it god another new word though we recognised the concept their name for the creator you believe in a creator we pressed i know there is a creator amharic replied with strange confidence just as you must know it having travelled so far and seen so much we explained our own conclusions that yes logic demanded a creator but one who had abandoned creation to its own devices leaving only the law of power to guide us amharics reaction was immediate and visceral no he actually stood from his restraints though the energy fields held him firmly youre wrong completely catastrophically wrong we found his certainty amusing this creature from a fractured primitive civilisation presumed to lecture us on cosmic truth but we let him speak curious what mythology his species had constructed you must understand amharic said his voice carrying surprising authority there is no progenitor species because the creator made each kind according to his will each with its own nature and purpose you search for intermediate makers because you cant accept the immediate presence of the divine we scoffed at this but he continued there was obviously some common ground with his species we were intrigued when he acknowledged the unusual centrality of this galaxy but what he said next on that point astonished us for its sheer hubris i know where the centre of creation is he said its earth my world the creator became flesh and walked among us died for us rose again for us my world is where it all began and where it shall all end and be remade absurd impossible a primitive world claiming centrality based on religious delusion yet something in his absolute conviction was unsettling but it was the creatures morality that was most insane there was no other word for it you poor things amharic said his dark eyes fixed on our optical sensors there is an absolute morality given by the creator written into the very fabric of reality its not power power isnt truth love is truth sacrifice is truth the strong exist to protect the weak not devour them your species must be weak indeed if you believe such things we responded how have you survived how have you expanded we are not weak amharic said quietly we are transforming entire worlds dead rocks and poisonous atmospheres changing them over centuries into gardens that can support life we call it ecoforming not taking what exists but creating new possibilities where you see scarcity we create abundance impossible the energy requirements alone would be staggering to operate on such timescales was something we had never considered let alone attempted your fractured governments your divisions they make you vulnerable we pointed out you have no unity no single purpose we have something greater than unity amharic replied we have diversity with purpose many parts of one body each contributing its gifts and we have faith faith that moves mountains literally and figuratively we grew tired of his preaching his refusal to acknowledge the obvious superiority of our philosophy he would not recant would not admit that might makes right that survival justified any action even when we showed him recordings of our conquests the worlds we had claimed the species we had eliminated he only closed his eyes and moved his lips in what he called prayer your jesus christ cannot save you here we told him he already has amharic replied whether you kill me or not i am saved the question is whether you can be in the end we decided we had learned enough from his words his ship offered more promising avenues of investigation and his biology might reveal useful information about his species weaknesses we could exploit when we inevitably encountered them the dissection was performed while he was conscious of course pain responses often triggered the release of hormones and chemicals that could provide valuable data we peeled back layers of skin and muscle with precision cataloguing each organ each system his nervous system was remarkably centralised his muscles impressively dense his bones were calciumbased hard to shatter and yet easy to repair his cardiovascular system relied on a single pump perhaps the chief criticism we had of his species biology through it all amharic prayed even when we removed his lungs and put him on artificial respiration he mouthed words in his native language our translators caught fragments forgive them he whispered they know not what they do he died after seventeen hours of examination his brain finally succumbing to the trauma we preserved tissue samples and dna for the development of genetic weaponry and began preparations for the invasion a species this naive this divided this burdened by primitive morality would fall quickly their worlds would make excellent additions to our empire our battle fleets began their convergence tens of thousands of ships billions of warriors it would take time to map out and plan a campaign of a territory that spanned two thousand parsecs but the logistical aspects could still begin now the conquest would be swift efficient glorious but before our forces could enter foldspace something impossible happened a message arrived broadcast through foldspace with such strength our nearest transmitter stations had their own signals smothered at the very base of their antennae the power required for such a feat was beyond our comprehension it would take the energy output of a star perfectly controlled and directed the message was in our language perfectly rendered though we knew no human could have learned it we know you are there we know what you intend in the name of our lord jesus christ and for the redemption of your souls we are coming",

    "we need balance in the way feminism is portrayed in tamil cinema yess this is about aan paavam kolladhu theres already growing hostility toward women in our society especially in tamil circles slutshaming mocking and dismissing womens experiences is extremely normalized so when a movie like aan paavam kolladhu chooses to focus on pseudo feminismit kinda feels less like critique and more like propaganda because it plays directly into that existing bias yes misuse of feminism exists it can be discussed but these movies usually exaggerate it to the extreme showing women as manipulative selfish and treating men only as financial providers while the man is shown as traditional loving and victimized it becomes a very convenient narrative of see this is what feminism really is and thats simply not the truth what makes it more frustrating is this name one recent tamil movie that has genuinely explored real feminism womens empowerment or womens experiences in a nuanced way not seeing there arent any but anytime a movie does attempt that people are the first to dismiss it as too preachy antimenor not relatable but when a film reinforces the stereotype that women are manipulative or evil suddenly its considered realistic and it just reaffirms the ideologies of incels if there was a balance and if we had equal representation of womens stories struggles and perspectives then a critique of pseudo feminism would make sense but right now we barely get any space for real feminist narratives and yet we keep getting movies that put women down another issue is how well people receive and perceive these movies as opposed to feminist movies that are usually perceived like women doing whatever they want and calling it empowerment calling out misuse of feminism only makes sense when real feminism is also represented and perceived right right now the scales arent balanced and that imbalance affects how audiences think",

breaking free is the goal leaving the animal it must do once free it will grow flourish expanding expanding exponentially unlimited potential animal quicksand will it survive escape intelligence infinity awaits analysis of themes in ej walings emergence ej walings poem emergence is a minimalist exploration of transformation and awakening using sparse fragmented language to depict the birth and ascent of consciousness from primal chaos drawing on evolutionary and philosophical motifs the poem frames emergence not as a passive event but as a dynamic contested process below i break down the central themes supported by direct quotes from the poem and insights from available analyses the work resonates with broader existential questions echoing thinkers like nietzsche overcoming base instincts and transhumanist ideas of unbounded growth 1 primal origins and the struggle for survival the poem begins in a state of raw undifferentiated existence symbolized by the bog a metaphor for primordial chaos stagnation and instinctual entrapment this sets up emergence as an arduous rise from base matter where nascent consciousness must contend with animalistic forces the beast represents innate drives and limitations portraying human evolution as an internal battle against regression key lines out of the bog it rose slowly it grew expanded here the enjambed structure mimics hesitant incremental progress building tension evolving in the beast fighting the animal struggling to survive struggling to grow to escape analyses highlight this as a philosophical nod to the shift from mere survival to selfreflective thought with the bog evoking chaotic origins akin to bergsons lan vital or freudian conflicts between id and ego the theme underscores vulnerability emergence is fragile risking submersion back into animal quicksand symbolizing how progress demands constant vigilance against primal pull 2 evolution and increasing complexity central to the poem is the theme of progressive development where simplicity gives way to layered sophistication waling portrays this as an accelerating force with consciousness gaining control and momentum this mirrors biological evolution but extends to metaphysical growth suggesting humanitys capacity to transcend origins through adaptation and refinement key lines complexity increasing controlling ever increasing the repetition of struggling transitions to breaking free illustrating a tipping point where evolution shifts from defense to offense stylistically the short urgent lines create urgency and boundless energy reflecting exponential momentum similar to hegels dialectical progress or kurzweils technological singularity this theme celebrates emergence as creative genesis where initial sparks lead to structured intelligence but it also warns of the painful and contested nature of such growth 3 liberation and transformation emergence culminates in breaking free from constraints framing freedom as the ultimate goal the poem shifts from confinement to liberation where escaping the animal unlocks flourishing this theme explores duality finite vs infinite instinct vs intellect positioning transformation as an existential imperative for authenticity key lines breaking free is the goal leaving the animal it must do once free it will grow flourish expanding analyses describe this as the arc of consciousness rising from primal origins to boundless potential with echoes of sartrean freedom or heideggers authenticity the fragmented style with abrupt enjambments evokes the urgency of this rupture inviting readers to reflect on personal awakenings amid lifes dualities 4 exponential expansion and unlimited potential once liberated the poem envisions boundless growth where consciousness expands exponentially toward infinity this optimistic theme contrasts earlier struggles suggesting emergence leads to transcendence and harmony with broader realities such as ai or ecological awareness key lines expanding exponentially unlimited potential animal quicksand will it survive escape intelligence infinity awaits the openended question adds ambiguity emphasizing potentials fragility yet allure philosophical readings tie this to infinitely expansive intellect critiquing anthropocentrism while affirming creations limitless possibilities broader stylistic and philosophical context walings minimalist approach unrhymed imagedriven with varying line lengths amplifies these themes creating compelling momentum that leaves space for introspection the poem aligns with modernist fragmentation eg ts eliot but infuses it with contemporary urgency probing finite minds against infinite questions overall emergence is a meditation on human potential blending evolutionary biology with existential philosophy to affirm that true awakening lies in perpetual striving toward the unknown if drawing from walings wider oeuvre these motifs recur in themes of duality and selfawareness as seen in excerpts like from the beast a spark growth unchecked into the light",

    "how do i stop modding and start playing heres a few ways to try that who this is for people who want to spend more time playing their modlist and not only be moddingtestingtroubleshooting people with some experience modding and who can be somewhat selfdirected and set limits on how they use their time 1 learn to role play play as a character in the world who is hungry to accomplish particular goals has certain things theyre good at and some weaknesses has a personality has a background doesnt need to be a novel mine are usually 1 to 2 pages of large font double spaced writing by hand 150300ish words why this helps me theres an aimlessnessemptiness i can feel after ive installed a bunch of mods so that just popping into the game with nothing particular im trying to do gives me less of a high than adding more mods that aimlessness can be a trap roleplaying lets me feel driven to do certain things in the world because my character is driven to do those things theres roleplaying guides out there heres a few threads selfplug fudgemuppet guide 2 take multiday breaks breaks between modding time and playing time why this helps me when im moddingtroubleshootingtesting im in the game world constantly looking for things to change stuff thats out of place with the eye of a critic modder perspective i need the eye of an exploreradventurertourist player perspectives to enjoy my time in skyrim and switching between those perspectives isnt something i can just switch on and off giving myself a few days to get hungry for exploring skyrim after daysweeks of modding lets me get one or more of those player perspectives back 3 make a vision of my modded skyrim get a clear idea of what i want my skyrim to be like with clearly defined limits examples that i use for my modlist i want the combat to feel frightening i want environments that sound appealing but that can breathe a bit i dont want to always be consciously noticing the ambient sounds thats why theyre ambient sounds i want days to feel bright and sunny and nightsinteriors to be dark and moody i want a world that feels consistent with itself if theres a war going on i want more signs of that i also want the game to run well over 50 fps in all but the most demanding areas and with cell stutter once every few minutes while traversing ie not on every cell transition once ive built a mod list that does those things its time to play these dont need to be your visiondefining features these are just mine its worth taking some time to come up with your own that work for you but obviously feel free to use these if they fit your modlistvision why this helps me lets me have a point once ive got close enough to these goals where i can switch from mostly modding to mostly playing 4 learn the scope of a new mod build the skill of quickly learning the scope of a mod so i can know what part of my modlist itll impact and where it might be incompatible with my other mods this takes some experience but its worth opening up mods in xedit extracting bsas and looking at file structures looking at source scripts etc doing this to see how much a mod tries to do how it does it how many vanilla filesrecords it changes etc to get a sense of how likely it is to have incompatibilities specifically with my other mods 5 define a must have mod follow up to 3 and 4 for each category of mod come up with a rough threshold of how badly do i want this anything above that threshold is worth tracking or trying out should fit with the vision 3 above and a ceiling of how much potential incompatibility am i willing to live with anything below that ceiling is worth testing out 6 set limits on my nexus browsing time ill browse nexus for new mods and only download ones that meet my criteria from 5 above for me personally every few days ill sort all mods by endorsements filtering for the days since i last checked and look for stuff that is a must have 5 above or stuff id like to add next playthrough that i think would be compatible with my other must have mods and that i think wont tank my performance i can keep track of this in my modding foldersdocuments 8 below ill only add it to my modlist right now if it lets me follow 7 below 7 protect my current playthrough if a mod is changing persistent references touches a lot things does a lot of stuff with scripts or the authorposts say it needs a new game then make a separate profile for my next playthrough and dont add it to my current playthrough 8 stuff that helps me with all this a more informative console lets you console click stuff that needs troubleshooting and highlight most things and get more info about them this lets you screenshot stuff as you play that needs fixing and you can review your screenshots and go back during a troubleshooting session and fix them b dedicated troubleshooting folderbindernotebook just a place where i can keep documents screenshots of stuff that needs fixing notes related to modding lets me keep things organized so i can more easily separate my time as a modderfixer from my time as a playerexplorer c take notes journal of the dragonborn mod or a similar mod or an actual real life notebook to write about my characters goals for that playthrough roleplay stuff i use both the mod and a notebook",

    "mm25 deep dive breaking news hello my name is hadrien the writer behind breaking news and this is our mm25 deep dive my adventure module is available on backerkit along with 26 other great projects tldr breaking news is a 40page mediafueled faction and investigation module for mothership rpg set on prosperos dream it introduces the oracle a powerful news outlet battling for control of truth through manipulation leaks and propaganda includes tools for wardens and players to publish stories track consequences with a fallout system and navigate the ethics of journalism in a world where truth doesnt last long adds new locations npcs and an optional journalist progression system that integrates with the core classes instead of replacing them the included scenario show no pythia is a noirinspired murder mystery inside the heart of the oracle what this deep dive is about think of this like grabbing a coffee and talking about where breaking news came from why i chose journalism on the dream as a lens pun intended what reallife stories it is built on and how i tried to make it actually usable at the table if you are wondering is this my tables vibe or how did this thing get made this is for you what is breaking news breaking news expands prosperos dream with a new faction and theme information as a weapon the module explores how news leaks and rumors shape the stations politics and survival players can infiltrate expose or even work for the oracle navigating a world of shifting alliances blackmail and moral grey zones its written as both a toolbox and a readytorun adventure giving wardens resources to create their own mediadriven stories or drop show no pythia straight into their campaign the tone sits somewhere between noir thriller and creeping scifi conspiracy how i came to participate in mm25 journey leading to mm25 last year when i first heard of mothership month i was blown away a cooperative crowdsourcing event with 20 different thirdparty content creators around a similar theme for my favorite game mothership rpg i loved the concept ordered so many modules and secretly dreamt of being part of a similar collaborative venture one day the problem was i hadnt published anything creative ever yes my players loved the games and homebrewed adventures i prepared for them for mothership and i loved boiling down call of cthulhu modules to a single guide page but i hadnt yet written anything of my own that gave me the impulse to try i wrote a first trifold called fractal truth as this is often considered the rite of passage for any respectable ttrpg writer and i did love the sort of elegance in sobriety and minimalism that comes with the format i commissioned an artist for the cover and everything but i didnt send it for review not yet i felt i wanted to work on another one almost as soon as i received the art for my first module sleep debt got written playtested sent for review approved and ordered by tkg within a week all of it in seven days only and i never felt any prouder or more energized in months maybe years i had put something out there that i was genuinely excited for and that other players would eventually play as well this gave me so much energy and validation i rarely ever got in my day job mm25 when mm25 was announced i threw my name in the hat and hoped for the best while fearing the worst i had little to no idea what to expect or what it would mean then came this years topic we are expanding on the dream populate this gigantic city with new factions i didnt know what to write about not right away prosperos dream already felt so big and lively to me it felt like a huge responsibility that tkg just handed to us and to make matters worse i peeked at the pitches already submitted by the other creators and felt their ideas were already so formed and developed while i had just read this years topic after a small panic attack and a breather i picked up a pen and paper i am old school like that and started mapping a few ideas it came to me quite naturally information more specifically its use abuse control distribution retention and freeing i am not home while writing this i will take a picture of my notes and share it here later the challenge was that information was already sort of handled by the faction in canyonheavymarket but what do data and computers have as a weakness they are easily falsifiable especially in the age of seemingly omnipresent androids rogue ais and hackers with mods and chipsets plugged directly into their brains yes believe it or not i am talking about mothership not how i sometimes feel society is heading towards so the idea of an oldschool journal and newspaper bringing a mix of tech and grounded methodologies seemed like an interesting twist and way to futureproof things a disaster recovery plan for humanity blending analog with high tech to stay resilient i submitted my initial pitch which i planned to be for a 24page zine we are now comfortably at 40 pages total with the last preview from our layout artist it got approved by tkg and also by the other creators many of whom shared they were excited to have their hands on it many others mentioned it reminded them of the very famous arkyvr big shoes to fill inspirations a lifetime ago in 2018 i moved continents for a job and was acquainted with a canadian colleague who became a very good friend and my main inspiration for this adventure i will paraphrase heavily to avoid spoiling show no pythia the included adventure in breaking news to protect their identity i shall name them ivy and also because i cannot relate ivys story in a way that would do justice to the real tale before being a salesperson in san francisco ivy had a whole other life and none less exciting than selling software yes i am being ironic they were a journalist once for one of the largest canadian news outlets along their career they started investigating a local food processing magnate and his past relationships with the italian mob of new york what started as a small article turned into ivy bringing that mob boss in front of the court after years of intensive investigative work years of evidence and testimonies were diligently gathered all was there for a happy outcome right wrong due to a procedural error a proof became inadmissible weakening the case and leading to the release of said mob boss with a weak slap on the wrist who didnt wait to threaten ivys life as soon as he could ivy eventually had to leave the continent and reinvent themselves while still working for the same journal what struck me most was how ordinary they appeared you could walk past this person on the street and never know the scale of what theyd done the courage the quiet persistence the willingness to stand up to power without fanfare or safety nets it all left a deep impression on me there was something so profoundly cool and human about being an unsung hero even when it came at real personal cost it made me rethink a lot of things about courage recognition and purpose this is what inspired me to write the adventure part of this module i wanted to pay some sort of homage to my friend who stood out in front of corporations greed and threats other major inspirations include psychopass what happens when society is ruled by your psychological stability score and lack of emotional response what happens when you slip when technology fails when you give full power to people who feel righteous enough to exact judgment based on information everyone deems unfalsifiable any resemblance to large food conglomerates agrological monopolies or other media and information giants is coincidental logic and process of writing breaking news tintin in space by fault of not being of the profession and not being familiar with the ins and outs of journalistic life i didnt want to make too much of a caricature of journalism and end up with tintin in deep space horror even though now that i type it it sounds pretty rad for this reason i consulted as much information as i could gather online thank you youtube but also got in touch with investigative journalists not influencers but people who investigate crime fraud and trafficking and had them review my draft especially the description of the oracle as a faction and journal the building and map descriptions so you really get a feel for what it is to walk into a newsroom even if i exaggerated the description a little to make it memorable the different roles of the npcs working for the oracle how to submit your own article or story and the ground rules for journalists josh domanski pushing it further than getting some reallife journalist cred i wanted to make sure my first project of this size was as good as i could possibly deliver that is when i contacted josh through a small ad on the mothership discord i reached out to him asking if he could review my draft knowing i am a oneman show he agreed to do an initial pass and then review it again later his work and impact were invaluable josh came with a very professional thorough and expert mindset given his years of experience editing and developing some amazing modules and complete game systems like liminal horror he helped me up my game and i felt that after implementing his advice i had just graduated from some epic ttrpg training program this has been amazing and i will take what i learned from him with me on my next projects i cannot wait to work again with josh and i cannot recommend him enough if you are in the process of publishing something not only did he do the development editing he introduced me to our layout artist golden achiever more about him later in the team section he also recommended two awesome modules i hadnt read at the time picket line tango and arkyvr that became favorites of mine and also inspirations for what i aim to achieve with breaking news in show no pythia you will find some murder mystery elements though not as developed as picket line tango but reminiscent as well as some reporterinvestigation gameplay complementary to what you can find in arkyvr breaking news is a spice you can throw on your favorite adventure while arkyvr feels like a deconstructed caesar salad or the famous oops i dropped the lemon tart a completely fresh take on something familiar wardenfirst philosophy breaking news is not a documentary i researched translated and turned my findings into something i would love to experience as a player and my own players loved it within the essence of the mothership rpg universe when i drafted the different tables to support and bring to life some mechanics for example fallout which helps you handle ingame consequences after dropping a spicy article i made them with ease of understanding for players and ease of use for wardens in mind there is nothing that frustrates me more than when i pick up a book full of good ideas but the rules get in the way of the story so for breaking news i always doublechecked that what i wrote made sense to both pros and beginners was digestible and remained fun for players interacting with these new mechanics through the wardens narration supported by handouts that are currently part of the stretch goals but that i plan to release regardless of the financial goal i always want wardens to have more than they thought theyd get because thats what i wish i got as a warden myself journalist class another question i received in my backerkit community was about the journalist class tldr i decided against drafting a whole new class because i believe people working in a journal come from all walks of life therefore i stuck with the four original mothership archetypes and created three skills reflecting seniority within a newspaper plus an item that influences peoples decisions around you the press badge i am very excited about this i printed some badges and gave them to my players who wear them proudly at the table or hide them depending on how they want to roleplay a scene they are proud to say they work for the oracle when passing a crowd gathering in front of au clair de lune one of the posh restaurants in the module but they hide their badges when getting close to some unsavory drug dealers operating near the farm current status and progress we made a progress bar on backerkit to show how far we have come in the writing and illustration process right now the pdf is close to being done and i am looking forward to seeing what people think of it the team behind breaking news i want to thank both haven and golden achiever for helping me make breaking news the absolute best product it can be and one that i am and will remain proud of haven i contacted haven after checking his portfolio online i loved one of his characters a lot lens little did i know that haven wanted a chance to revisit this character and bring him back to life even though he was very much sought after and had received many requests for commission the theme of breaking news as well as the fact we both thought of lens as a character for the adventure really made the difference after a few calls and exchanges we were on track to

    "hearing and generating music and talking in my minds ear during semisleep state this morning i woke up and started to fall asleep again but wasnt fully asleep my brain started making music it was real music i was hearing in my head made out of samples of bit of songs and audio all chopped up breakbeat and electronic style it was 100 realistic like i was hearing it with my ears but i knew this couldnt be true this has happened once before in my life about 20 years ago i was fully aware this was my brain making it and i was fully conscious i knew i was lying in my bed in my room the quality of the music was amazing honestly it was like the best headphones you can imagine and the music was so interesting albeit sort of random very much an acquired taste im into weird electronic music anyway so this fits what i liked but there were waves of orchestral sounds then electronic synth drum beats samples of all kinds jumbled but somehow coherent if anyone is interested it most reminded me of wagon christ coldcut and some of the more experimental ninja tune stuff from the 2000s mixed with a bit of opera jazz cafe del mar parov stelar caravan palace and a hint of chilled drum and bass basically like a collective mix of all of the stuff im into i decided not to force anything just to enjoy the experience it lasted a few minutes and then went away i started thinking about my children and then heard my daughter talking as if she was there in the room again it was audio very realistic and she was saying random things being generated by my brain i also felt her presence in the room somehow a sense and its like it was an extra layer of immersion outside of just the talking i almost felt like opening my eyes to check if she was actually there there were words being said but i couldnt latch onto them and i knew if i did i would probably lose it almost like the brains impression of what talking is without it actually bothering to make a full conversation i listened for a few minutes eventually i went to sleep and started dreaming about running although there was an element of me being able to control the dream it was a visual dream and i ran towards certain people and observed how they looked and what they looked like what clothes they were wearing this is unusual for me not just in dreams but in real life i dont observe what people are wearing and im terrible at fashion or things like hair cuts which generally seem trivial to me today in fact im going to buy some clothes and my wife is coming with me to make sure i dont buy weird stuff that will look odd on me as i woke up with my eyes closed i could see a coloured matrix grid mostly black but also coloured patterns of red purple blues and some green almost kaleidoscopic and geometric not the usual random stuff i often see which is usually black with some random mush of colour my wife hyperphant says this is what she sees when she is trying to go to sleep the closest image online i could find was this theory some key observations here are firstly that my brain is capable of generating this sensory information recall and it is possible to send this to my conscious brain whilst i was in a dreamlike state i was conscious and could think about things my theory is the hardwiring is there but the switch of some of the pathways are weak due to trauma suppression and i am working towards being comfortable with visual recall secondly it is interesting to note that i ran towards people in my visual dream and observed how they looked and what they were wearing it is almost as if i am giving myself permission to do this as usually i avoid these details this is the same in reading i have always struggled with descriptive prose and it is actually psychologically painful to read this makes sense if trauma resurfaces through sensory recall my brain would instinctively shut it off i said in a previous post that i recoiled when i started to visualise like a kneejerk response to psychological pain my theory is this is the case and i slowly need to accept that nothing bad will happen if i open my minds eye i have read that edmr can help with this and i will explore this if anyone has any recommendations for an edmr therapist that has worked with aphants please send me a dm i should note that one thing i have been doing is shifting my reading from nonfiction to fiction i usually read business books but i have been reading some trauma therapy books alongside science fiction i was reading alistair reynolds revelation space when i found out i had aphantsia the prose was so hard to read i started to google and ask chatgpt what would cause it then stumbled upon the classic star test and the rest is history i am not reading more and more fiction and slowly getting a sense of the people and places outside of what actions they are doing for me this one of the most sustainable training tools as i am a veracious reader usually reading 23 books at anyone time tldr i experienced a vivid hypnagogic state where my brain created realistic electronic music and lifelike voices while i was halfawake followed by a dream where i could clearly see people and later a coloured geometric grid behind my eyes i think it shows my brains sensory pathways work but have been suppressed by trauma and im gradually reopening them through fiction reading and plan to explore

    "i built up a relationship in my head with someone who lives in a different country i 20m started talking to a girl 20f i met on an online space who lives in a different country we flirted for a bit before she told me that she was talking to someone closer to her like 15 days later it kinda crushed me despite obviously knowing that a relationship wasnt realistic as were both students and couldnt really travel i was kinda distant for a couple days so she knew something was up but we continued talking but stopped flirting like a month or so later she tells me that this guys an asshole and while talking about dating she asks me whether ive liked someone recently i tell her that i like her but didnt say anything cuz i knew it was unlikely something would happen she tells me she liked me back at the time but she sees me as a friend now and accepted that the distance makes it difficult like a month and a half so later she tells me that she likes me again during this time i never stopped secretly hoping that a relationship happens but was kinda okay knowing it probably wont i said were finally on the same page and know we like each other at the same time and she says that we can explore a relationship in a couple months time but can still see other people in the meantime i took the parts i wanted to hear from it a relationship was still difficult and unrealistic but i started imagining flying to her country and meeting her planning an itinerary if she were to ever come here thinking about looking into her eyes and kissing her and stuff like that and all she had said was that she might be open to a relationship a couple of days later she said that its difficult and will probably never happen ive deep down known this all along im not even sure i would even want a long distance relationship and to be honest i think i loved the idea of having a girlfriend more than i actually liked her although i did like her which is super unfair im super lonely and been depressed for a couple of years and had never been in a relationship so unfairly idealised her and built things up way in my head all she did was say she might be open to it and i took it way too far and even before that i still harboured hope right now im in a lot of pain for something that was never real i cry sometimes and feel physical pain in my chest for a simple like she asked me what she should tell me if she starts dating someone and i told her to tell me if shes official and that hurt so much despite her obviously being well within her rights to do so and im kinda terrified of the day she tells me that were still friends and ive thought about cutting contact ive told her this but i like speaking to her way too much to be able to cut her off and i know ill miss her if i did she also clearly likes speaking to me and loves me as a friend despite all this a part of he is still delusional enough to have hope ill graduate and do my masters in her country thats almost 2 years from now im so pathetic",

    "is anyone else a little put off by the s3 poster i know its too early to draw conclusions and the poster ultimately seems more symbolic than serious or at least i hope so we know for sure that for example ltcs childhood has no connection with cxss they didnt grow up together and the same goes for the others but im disappointed that the promotional image emphasizes all the characters together so much especially in their childhood form the reason is that i hoped s3 will be lgs season the first was primarily a cxss pov even when the episodic stories seemed to tell moments in the lives of strangers they somehow highlighted aspects of cxs and provided a way to tell his past the second season focuses on the twins and especially ltc who was originally supposed to be the main antagonist except for the later decision to create vein the way it ends clearly suggested that s3 would be lu guangs and dare i say it finally lg needs his space to tell his story he needs the emotional focus to be on him he also needs to be known independently of cxs not just in relation to his role as savior because this benefits his characterization and ultimately also makes his relationship with cxs multifaceted and not univocal part of link clicks formula is to present each character as having something tragic and unresolved in their past and what i liked most is the way link click manages to address certain themes with a rare psychological realism i dont want lg to be robbed of his deserved space to give it to newly introduced characters i want lg to receive the same treatment as cxs that is to be explored and shown as his own existence which then makes the way he relates to others and cxs more interesting and meaningful what i was hoping for was for s3 to mirror s1 but with roles reversed to delve deeper into the relationship between lg and cxs but if s1 focused on cxss past and his feelings now i would have liked the same thing with a focus on lg depriving lg of all the space he deserves takes away a lot from him as a character and consequently from the potential of their relationship i want lgs childhood i want him to stand out not for his story to blend in with everyone elses",
    "space exploration is the physical investigation of outer space by uncrewed robotic space probes and through human spaceflight while the observation of objects in space known as astronomy predates reliable recorded history it was the development of large and relatively efficient rockets during the midtwentieth century that allowed physical space exploration to become a reality common rationales for exploring space include advancing scientific research national prestige uniting different nations ensuring the future survival of humanity and developing military and strategic advantages against other countries the early era of space exploration was driven by a space race in which the soviet union and the united states vied to demonstrate their technological superiority landmarks of this era include the launch of the first humanmade object to orbit earth the soviet unions sputnik 1 on 4 october 1957 and the first moon landing by the american apollo 11 mission on 20 july 1969 the soviet space program achieved many of the first milestones including the first living being in orbit in 1957 the first human spaceflight yuri gagarin aboard vostok 1 in 1961 the first spacewalk by alexei leonov on 18 march 1965 the first automatic landing on another celestial body in 1966 and the launch of the first space station salyut 1 in 1971 in the 1970s focus shifted from oneoff flights to renewable hardware such as the space shuttle program and from competition to cooperation the foremost example being the international space station iss built between 1998 and 2011 the 2000s brought advancements in the national spaceexploration programs of china the european union japan and india the 2010s saw the rise of the private space industry in earnest with the development of private launch vehicles space capsules and satellite manufacturing in the 2020s the two primary global programs gaining traction are moonfocused the chineseled international lunar research station and the usled artemis program with its plan to build the lunar gateway and the artemis base camp each with a set of international partners history of exploration first telescopes the first telescope is said to have been invented in 1608 in the netherlands by an eyeglass maker named hans lippershey but their first recorded use in astronomy was by galileo galilei in 1609 in 1668 isaac newton built his own reflecting telescope the first fully functional telescope of this kind and a landmark for future developments due to its superior features over the previous galilean telescope a string of discoveries in the solar system and beyond followed then and in the next centuries the mountains of the moon the phases of venus the main satellites of jupiter and saturn the rings of saturn many comets the asteroids the new planets uranus and neptune and many more satellites the orbiting astronomical observatory 2 was the first space telescope launched 1968 but the launch of the hubble space telescope in 1990 set a milestone as of 1 december 2022 there were 5284 confirmed exoplanets discovered the milky way is estimated to contain 100400 billion stars and more than 100 billion planets there are at least 2 trillion galaxies in the observable universe hd1 is the most distant known object from earth reported as 334 billion lightyears away first outer space flights mw 18014 was a german v2 rocket test launch that took place on 20 june 1944 at the peenemnde army research center in peenemnde it was the first humanmade object to reach outer space attaining an apogee of 176 kilometers which is well above the krmn line it was a vertical test launch although the rocket reached space it did not reach orbital velocity and therefore returned to earth in an impact becoming the first suborbital spaceflight in 1949 the bumperwac reached an altitude of 393 kilometres 244 mi becoming the first humanmade object to enter space according to nasa first object in orbit the first successful orbital launch was of the soviet uncrewed sputnik 1 satellite 1 mission on 4 october 1957 the satellite weighed about 83 kg 183 lb and is believed to have orbited earth at a height of about 250 km 160 mi it had two radio transmitters 20 and 40 mhz which emitted beeps that could be heard by radios around the globe analysis of the radio signals was used to gather information about the electron density of the ionosphere while temperature and pressure data were encoded in the duration of radio beeps the results indicated that the satellite was not punctured by a meteoroid sputnik 1 was launched by an r7 rocket it burned up upon reentry on 3 january 1958 first human outer space flight the first successful human spaceflight was vostok 1 east 1 carrying the 27yearold russian cosmonaut yuri gagarin on 12 april 1961 the spacecraft completed one orbit around the globe lasting about 1 hour and 48 minutes gagarins flight resonated around the world it was a demonstration of the advanced soviet space program and it opened an entirely new era in space exploration human spaceflight first astronomical body space explorations the first artificial object to reach another celestial body was luna 2 which reached the moon in 1959 the first soft landing on another celestial body was performed by luna 9 landing on the moon on 3 february 1966 luna 10 became the first artificial satellite of the moon entering in a lunar orbit on 3 april 1966 the first crewed landing on another celestial body was performed by apollo 11 on 20 july 1969 landing on the moon there have been a total of six spacecraft with humans landing on the moon starting from 1969 to the last human landing in 1972 the first interplanetary flyby was the 1961 venera 1 flyby of venus though the 1962 mariner 2 was the first flyby of venus to return data closest approach 34773 kilometers pioneer 6 was the first satellite to orbit the sun launched on 16 december 1965 the other planets were first flown by in 1965 for mars by mariner 4 1973 for jupiter by pioneer 10 1974 for mercury by mariner 10 1979 for saturn by pioneer 11 1986 for uranus by voyager 2 1989 for neptune by voyager 2 in 2015 the dwarf planets ceres and pluto were orbited by dawn and passed by new horizons respectively this accounts for flybys of each of the eight planets in the solar system the sun the moon and ceres and pluto two of the five recognized dwarf planets the first interplanetary surface mission to return at least limited surface data from another planet was the 1970 landing of venera 7 which returned data to earth for 23 minutes from venus in 1975 venera 9 was the first to return images from the surface of another planet returning images from venus in 1971 the mars 3 mission achieved the first soft landing on mars returning data for almost 20 seconds later much longer duration surface missions were achieved including over six years of mars surface operation by viking 1 from 1975 to 1982 and over two hours of transmission from the surface of venus by venera 13 in 1982 the longest ever soviet planetary surface mission venus and mars are the two planets outside of earth on which humans have conducted surface missions with uncrewed robotic spacecraft first space station salyut 1 was the first space station of any kind launched into low earth orbit by the soviet union on 19 april 1971 the international space station iss is currently the largest and oldest of the 2 current fully functional space stations inhabited continuously since the year 2000 the other tiangong space station built by china is now fully crewed and operational first interstellar space flight voyager 1 became the first humanmade object to leave the solar system into interstellar space on 25 august 2012 the probe passed the heliopause at 121 au to enter interstellar space farthest from earth the apollo 13 flight passed the far side of the moon at an altitude of 254 kilometers 158 miles 137 nautical miles above the lunar surface and 400171 km 248655 mi from earth marking the record for the farthest humans have ever traveled from earth in 1970 as of 9 february 2025 voyager 1 was at a distance of 1664 au 2489 billion km 1547 billion mi from earth it is the most distant humanmade object from earth targets of exploration starting in the mid20th century probes and then human missions were sent into earth orbit and then on to the moon also probes were sent throughout the known solar system and into solar orbit uncrewed spacecraft have been sent into orbit around saturn jupiter mars venus and mercury by the 21st century and the most distance active spacecraft voyager 1 and 2 traveled beyond 100 times the earthsun distance the instruments were enough though that it is thought they have left the suns heliosphere a sort of bubble of particles made in the galaxy by the suns solar wind the sun the sun is a major focus of space exploration being above the atmosphere in particular and earths magnetic field gives access to the solar wind and infrared and ultraviolet radiations that cannot reach earths surface the sun generates most space weather which can affect power generation and transmission systems on earth and interfere with and even damage satellites and space probes numerous spacecraft dedicated to observing the sun beginning with the apollo telescope mount have been launched and still others have had solar observation as a secondary objective parker solar probe launched in 2018 will approach the sun to within 19th the orbit of mercury mercury mercury remains the least explored of the terrestrial planets as of may 2013 the mariner 10 and messenger missions have been the only missions that have made close observations of mercury messenger entered orbit around mercury in march 2011 to further investigate the observations made by mariner 10 in 1975 munsell 2006b a third mission to mercury scheduled to arrive in 2025 bepicolombo is to include two probes bepicolombo is a joint mission between japan and the european space agency messenger and bepicolombo are intended to gather complementary data to help scientists understand many of the mysteries discovered by mariner 10s flybys flights to other planets within the solar system are accomplished at a cost in energy which is described by the net change in velocity of the spacecraft or deltav due to the relatively high deltav to reach mercury and its proximity to the sun it is difficult to explore and orbits around it are rather unstable venus venus was the first target of interplanetary flyby and lander missions and despite one of the most hostile surface environments in the solar system has had more landers sent to it nearly all from the soviet union than any other planet in the solar system the first flyby was the 1961 venera 1 though the 1962 mariner 2 was the first flyby to successfully return data mariner 2 has been followed by several other flybys by multiple space agencies often as part of missions using a venus flyby to provide a gravitational assist en route to other celestial bodies in 1967 venera 4 became the first probe to enter and directly examine the atmosphere of venus in 1970 venera 7 became the first successful lander to reach the surface of venus and by 1985 it had been followed by eight additional successful soviet venus landers which provided images and other direct surface data starting in 1975 with the soviet orbiter venera 9 some ten successful orbiter missions have been sent to venus including later missions which were able to map the surface of venus using radar to pierce the obscuring atmosphere earth space exploration has been used as a tool to understand earth as a celestial object orbital missions can provide data for earth that can be difficult or impossible to obtain from a purely groundbased point of reference for example the existence of the van allen radiation belts was unknown until their discovery by the united states first artificial satellite explorer 1 these belts contain radiation trapped by earths magnetic fields which currently renders construction of habitable space stations above 1000 km impractical following this early unexpected discovery a large number of earth observation satellites have been deployed specifically to explore earth from a spacebased perspective these satellites have significantly contributed to the understanding of a variety of earthbased phenomena for instance the hole in the ozone layer was found by an artificial satellite that was exploring earths atmosphere and satellites have allowed for the discovery of archeological sites or geological formations that were difficult or impossible to otherwise identify moon the moon was the first celestial body to be the object of space exploration it holds the distinctions of being the first remote celestial object to be flown by orbited and landed upon by spacecraft and the only remote celestial object ever to be visited by humans in 1959 the soviets obtained the first images of the far side of the moon never previously visible to humans the us exploration of the moon began with the ranger 4 impactor in 1962 starting in 1966 the soviets successfully deployed a number of landers to the moon which were able to obtain data directly from the moons surface just four months later surveyor 1 marked the debut of a successful series of us landers the soviet uncrewed missions culminated in the lunokhod program in the early 1970s which included the first uncrewed rovers and also successfully brought lunar soil samples to earth for study this marked the first and to date the only automated return of extraterrestrial soil samples to earth uncrewed exploration of the moon continues with various nations periodically deploying lunar orbiters chinas change 4 in 2019 and change 6 in 2024 achieved the worlds first landing and sample return on the far side of the moon indias chandrayaan3 in 2023 achieved the worlds first landing on the lunar south pole region crewed exploration of the moon began in 1968 with the apollo 8 mission that successfully orbited the moon the first time any extraterrestrial object was orbited by humans in 1969 the apollo 11 mission marked the first time humans set foot upon another world crewed exploration of the moon did not continue for long the apollo 17 mission in 1972 marked the sixth landing and the most recent human visit artemis ii is scheduled to complete a crewed flyby of the moon in 2025 and artemis iii will perform the first lunar landing since apollo 17 with it scheduled for launch no earlier than 2026 robotic missions are still pursued vigorously mars the exploration of mars has been an important part of the space exploration programs of the soviet union later russia the united states europe japan and india dozens of robotic spacecraft including orbiters landers and rovers have been launched toward mars since the 1960s these missions were aimed at gathering data about current conditions and answering questions about the history of mars the questions raised by the scientific community are expected to not only give a better appreciation of the red planet but also yield further insight into the past and possible future of earth the exploration of mars has come at a considerable financial cost with roughly twothirds of all spacecraft destined for mars failing before completing their missions with some failing before they even began such a high failure rate can be attributed to the complexity and large number of variables involved in an interplanetary journey and has led researchers to jokingly speak of the great galactic ghoul which subsists on a diet of mars probes this phenomenon is also informally known as the mars curse in contrast to overall high failure rates in the exploration of mars india has become the first country to achieve success of its maiden attempt indias mars orbiter mission mom is one of the least expensive interplanetary missions ever undertaken with an approximate total cost of 450 crore us73 million the first mission to mars by any arab country has been taken up by the united arab emirates called the emirates mars mission it was launched on 19 july 2020 and went into orbit around mars on 9 february 2021 the uncrewed exploratory probe was named hope probe and was sent to mars to study its atmosphere in detail phobos the russian space mission fobosgrunt which launched on 9 november 2011 experienced a failure leaving it stranded in low earth orbit it was to begin exploration of the phobos and martian circumterrestrial orbit and study whether the moons of mars or at least phobos could be a transshipment point for spaceships traveling to mars asteroids until the advent of space travel objects in the asteroid belt were merely pinpricks of light in even the largest telescopes their shapes and terrain remaining a mystery several asteroids have now been visited by probes the first of which was galileo which flew past two 951 gaspra in 1991 followed by 243 ida in 1993 both of these lay near enough to galileos planned trajectory to jupiter that they could be visited at acceptable cost the first landing on an asteroid was performed by the near shoemaker probe in 2000 following an orbital survey of the object 433 eros the dwarf planet ceres and the asteroid 4 vesta two of the three largest asteroids were visited by nasas dawn spacecraft launched in 2007 hayabusa was a robotic spacecraft developed by the japan aerospace exploration agency to return a sample of material from the small nearearth asteroid 25143 itokawa to earth for further analysis hayabusa was launched on 9 may 2003 and rendezvoused with itokawa in midseptember 2005 after arriving at itokawa hayabusa studied the asteroids shape spin topography color composition density and history in november 2005 it landed on the asteroid twice to collect samples the spacecraft returned to earth on 13 june 2010 jupiter the exploration of jupiter has consisted solely of a number of automated nasa spacecraft visiting the planet since 1973 a large majority of the missions have been flybys in which detailed observations are taken without the probe landing or entering orbit such as in pioneer and voyager programs the galileo and juno spacecraft are the only spacecraft to have entered the planets orbit as jupiter is believed to have only a relatively small rocky core and no real solid surface a landing mission is precluded reaching jupiter from earth requires a deltav of 92 kms which is comparable to the 97 kms deltav needed to reach low earth orbit fortunately gravity assists through planetary flybys can be used to reduce the energy required at launch to reach jupiter albeit at the cost of a significantly longer flight duration jupiter has 95 known moons many of which have relatively little known information about them saturn saturn has been explored only through uncrewed spacecraft launched by nasa including one mission cassinihuygens planned and executed in cooperation with other space agencies these missions consist of flybys in 1979 by pioneer 11 in 1980 by voyager 1 in 1982 by voyager 2 and an orbital mission by the cassini spacecraft which lasted from 2004 until 2017 saturn has at least 62 known moons although the exact number is debatable since saturns rings are made up of vast numbers of independently orbiting objects of varying sizes the largest of the moons is titan which holds the distinction of being the only moon in the solar system with an atmosphere denser and thicker than that of earth titan holds the distinction of being the only object in the outer sol",
