    "owlmost done but last post hey everyone this is my reflection post for anyone considering the program de new program all that remains is my capstone which is something i started working on in august im about 23 weeks away from the degree ill share my thoughts on the classes instructors curriculum and educational model ill talk about what i did to augment my education with some recommendations based on where i entered the program my course level takeaways 1 d596 this is a weed out course its designed to see if you can put together a coherent essay consider it the true orientation its also designed to see if you understand what this field actually is and if its right for you like a lot of people i did this in a few days taking my time just to understand the process mostly i think its ok to feel intimidated or nervous during this course but if its challenging please throw in the towel 2 d597 also a weed out course but the other extreme tons of new concepts unless you have experience in sql and nosql getting your environment up and running for the first time is the challenge before the challenge if this all new to you you have the option of the virtual machine but i would recommend avoiding it the learning curve is steep youll learn a lot of new tools eg docker postgresql mongo plus their clis if you choose highly recommended this was my first am i in over my head moment this was the single longest course for me by far i took my time though 3 d598 your true foundational python course the prereq course is a joke you need to understand objectoriented programming this course would be a 10 minute conversation with claude to complete with ai alone dont do it there are courses to bullshit and others to take seriously take this one seriously this is where people diverge you can get by this entire program with jupyter notebooks this was the point where i chose my preferred ide and told myself i would create full functions and scripts and learn bash i also wanted to learn good devops practices 4 d599 felt like real grad school you have advanced academic reading in statistics programming in python and lengthy assignments you need to start learning gitlab to submit your work the hardest course for me of the program but essential to understanding the foundations of classical ml 5 d600 a continuation of d599 in almost all respects felt slightly easier 6 d601 your term 2 break i didnt see much of the point in diving too deep into tableau in the de track good to see the process and the capabilities i ignored the sections on presenting to audiences first time i felt the materials were a waste of time but might have been specific to my background 7 d602 technically much more difficult i thought that the concepts presented were important but didnt logically flow together my mind wanted to assume connections that never materialized because the previous courses felt much more linearly structured this felt like a hodgepodge of everything that didnt fit into the other general courses 8 d607 real tools again youve gone over the conceptual strategies for different databases and now youre seeing how everything ties together the storage and compute layers are peeled back and you get to see them for the first time 9 d608 most aggravating course worst instructions getting worse as time goes on i think this is a terrible introduction to airflow at present the udacity nanodegree instructions are disjointed i had to stop following the instructions given and create my own conceptual framework for solving the problem the course is unofficial intro to orchestration 10 d609 same setup as d608 but the materials and assignments are slightly better quality i found this course conceptually easier than d608 i ignored all of the curriculum content and plugged in keywords to chatgpt so i could create my own learning guides spark is welldocumented 11 d610 in process now not expecting issues will explain below my instructor takeaways i specifically chose not to interact with the instructors nothing against them personally i would just rather read and find the answers myself this slowed me down incredibly in the beginning because i would let myself get taken down rabbit holes intentionally it was like drinking through a firehouse every keyword i had to research required learning three more in the process as a former teacher i also wanted to avoid the biases that inevitably creep up educators have a tendency to emphasize the subjects they feel are important when times change even smart people dont keep up sometimes and they end up emphasizing the wrong thing ill explain why id do it again below i did interact with a few people along the way 1 dr rutledge i had a very simple question that in hindsight was stupid d597 dr rutledge responded promptly and was helpful my only interaction with her 2 dr middleton had her for d598 and d599 always got back to me super quick with questions and calls extremely helpful and it seemed like she knew all of the material inside and out i was extremely impressed by her i think she represents the best part of the competency based learning model when evaluation is stripped away from instruction it makes the professors better at both teaching and understanding their areas of expertise 3 dr pettersen he sent me a nice email checking in after i had an assignment kicked back for a very minor error this was the grand total of my interactions with the instructors support lines were also very helpful throughout this process whenever i needed something i also had a very supportive mentor who seemed quite knowledgable about the internal procedures i would have had no clue about to that end i didnt utilize wgu connect either no virtual seminars my curriculum takeaways the individual materials that composed my specialization courses were dated and unhelpful but the overall curriculum is well thought out the courses flow naturally from one to the other as best as they reasonably can that being said youll need supplements and research to fill in gaps the first three courses are necessary fundamentals the next two are necessary to understand how statistical models work under the hood and how they drive ml the next two were filling in necessary concepts to da that didnt fit well in the other classes eg presentation skills dashboards apis and logging and monitoring the final three de specialization courses covered cloud databases orchestration and distributed computing youll use all three major cloud service providers tools and some other industry goodies it ties in the concepts from d5978 and all the generic business scenario assignments youve done to date if you believe the official wgu statements the curriculum was made with input from business leaders among others to make the degrees relevant to what employers want they did a very good job here as i search job listings currently the tools wgu presents are wellaligned to the descriptionsqualifications you wont be able to say youre proficient by any means unless you have some experience but you will be able to say oh yeah im worked with x a bit im familiar with the basics about midway through the program i considered switching to another online program different school but same field it was shortlived and i was pissed at having to fight evaluators in d599 but i stayed pretty much all the issues i had in the program which were minor allinall were related to d599 nothing similar ever cropped up after while i was researching other online programs from the name brand universities with brickandmortar locations i peeked at their curriculums i was surprised by how much better the wgu curriculum seemed given my research another de program had a course dedicated to blockchain technology i get how thats relevant to the field but in applying for jobs ive yet to see more than 1 posting request related experience in crypto one offering had a course geared towards llms which i think are the dogandpony show of ai theyre great but so are the other ml models that 999 of the population has never heard of the flow of the courses also seemed strange to me even though the msda is new a lot of these other programs are newer the bugs that people see in the msda i could easily imagine being way worse elsewhere in looking at the original program the d2xx courses i cant help but think things got more difficult its hard to compare because the course structures changed but the original curriculum seemed based around more narrow specifically defined skills unless someone from the old program decides to go back in for kicks i suppose well never know thoughts on the educational modelwgu itself had absolutely no idea what to think about wgu at the start of this process only heard about it after googling online grad schools and getting targeted ads what stood out to me was that the university itself has an incredibly unique mandate the western governors who started the school were experimenting with a brand new educational model in a space that only university of phoenix seemed to occupy at the time the online schools that i had heard of were the forprofit models that ended up going belly up wgu is technically private but its truly a nonprofit at 4k a term with the ability to finish early its truly geared to be affordable from what i gather they also pay their staff decently well too the competency model produces outcomes that are probably not different than a traditional degree there are always going to be people who brag how they did x degree in x weeksmonths definitely not a good look but it is what it is i think it comes down to how much background the person already has their life circumstances and their willingness to do the absolute bare minimum to get the degree as quickly as possible and their ai usage i remember seeing a student post asking about how to decrease query time in mongo to satisfy a rubric requirement the problem they faced was that their query was a single stage transformation that filtered all transactions from north america or something like that nevermind that the purpose of all of the msda disciplines is to typically aggregate and analyze data the poster couldnt recognize that a query that returns 10000 rows in 0 ms has zero practical value and yet their strategy was to make everything as simple as possible because all you need to truly do is conform your response to the rubric theres no qualitative aspect to how good an assignment is versus another because grades are meaningless this is the dark side of the competency model that people are willing to game it in stupid ways thankfully i dont think this is quite as easy in the new program despite this i think the model outperforms brickandmortar in one key area cheating theres much less ability to pass around papers or assignments in online school you really dont know anyone youre working at different paces with different instructors the instructor who gives out the same test year after year doesnt exist here the school periodically changes scenario documents to prevent 11 cheating put the results of your analysis in at your own risk can you be sure that there wasnt a unique identifying value in your specific dataset to detect duplication there will never be a perfect solution to cheating but i think this is one of the least imperfect options out there separating evaluation from instruction is an amazing idea and i think wgus processes are solid the concept of mentors was incredibly foreign to me at first but i completely understand their utility now about my journey i had very little coding experience entering the program i had done some java in undergrad some vba at work and a small amount of c with arduino chipsets in each case it was the most basic of basic but i understood some of the concepts weirdly going from these languages to python made me hate python at first i was used to strictly declarative languages and interpretive languages was a novel concept to me didnt last long though before i entered the program i read the dummys guides on sql and python took a few weeks but well worth it dont waste your money in term 1 doing basic coding practice i was a high school science and math teacher before this i have a degree in the hard sciences noncs i found a lot of relevance between my undergrad and the degree in some of the technical areas still some spots were challenging i agree with the revised program requirements for degree subject area psychology is a science but i cant imagine it being helpful here i think once people work their way through the new program well see a significant drop off in the graduation rate i didnt work while i got the degree i know this isnt feasible for a lot of people still working almost every day for anywhere from 812 hours on average this degree took me 8 months im convinced at this point that the only people who accelerate while working are 1 using ai rampantly and doing the bare minimum 2 already wellversed in these subjects and looking to check a box or 3 lying when someone posts about how it took them 15 hours total to do a class with 10 hours of videos 600 pages of reading and three heavy assignments i immediately question how much they actually learned which brings me to the next point i had a goal that i want to get at least two industry certifications at an intermediate or above level i studied took and passed databricks data engineer associate and aws solutions architect associate this slowed me down but i cant recommend this enough the masters by itself isnt enough its a great way to explore the concepts but it doesnt cover the tools well enough the certs filled in those gaps for me the industry materials were way more comprehensive than wgus and very accessible i also get to put them on my resume even still though the masters and the certs werent enough i started working on my capstone project in august it was a project near and dear to me that id wanted to do for a long time regardless in doing the project i specifically took the most common tools cited in job postings and designed my project to revolve around the tools themselves my capstone is an endtoend demonstration of everything ive learned it uses airflow grafana prometheus plotly dash aws gluebatchfargateecsec2cloudwatchsecretsiametc and a semantic segmentation ml vision api i trained and annotated myself with roboflow i think theres a few more i missed all of these things served a very unique purpose in teaching me a completely new discipline i feel like i actually understand what the field is at this point and its so god damned massive i need the masters certs and project to pull everything together ive been keeping an eye on job postings regularly over the last two months im fortunate to be in a good area for de positions overall the number of new listings is increasing the salaries increasing and the requirements decreasing despite the wider job market and economy i havent felt this good about my job prospects in years i would definitely recommend this program as part of a wellrounded education no regrets good luck yall",

get five advance chapters so do we think this is the spider i said letting out an involuntary shiver id never been one to be arachnophobic back on earth but the way those things shrieked and came at you not to mention there were actual venomous versions that could harm a walking twolegged sapient unlike most places on earth was enough to make me shiver when i heard that name so i guess it was doing an effective job it could be varis said or it could be that these are merely one of the numerous bands of people who rove through the undercity on the regular so thats like a normal thing i said blinking and staring of course it is she said why wouldnt it be so you have an entire population living so far outside the law that they come down to the undercity to hang out and avoid the empresss attention all sorts of fun new ideas were forming in my head of course all of that depended an awful lot on whether we were talking about political dissidents or if we were talking about people who were merely down here because they couldnt find a way to make ends meet up above but either way it was something i could probably use though the political dissidents were probably going to be a bigger pain in the ass than people who were just down here because they couldnt make ends meet under the empresss regime why do i get the feeling youre scheming something bill varis said turning and smiling at me probably because you can feel that scheming feeling coming through the link theres a scheming feeling that comes through the link apparently there isnt i said grinning im going to remember that and use it wonderful she said rolling her eyes i tried to take a step forward again my foot was a little wobbly though i felt better than before still there was a tingling that ran all up and down my scalp that probably didnt mean anything good but i very much needed to have a chat with these assholes it would be really annoying if we managed to survive everything else that had come at us recently only to find ourselves being killed by a bunch of lowlevel bandits living in one of the undercity levels and we werent even in the lowest level i felt a tingle of excitement running through me that had nothing to do with all of the neural interface issues as i thought about the other levels there were out there waiting to be explored this was almost more fun than trying to take on the empress bill varis said her voice flat what are you doing going to have a conversation with the nice bandits i said and i tried to say it in my nicest tone possible bill i mean it in the best possible way varis said talking in a quiet voice but you are in no condition to have a conversation with anyone let alone have a conversation with a notorious bandit leader well yeah but we have an entire army at our back its not like we need to be afraid of a little bandit i glanced over to the drone hovering to the side and he did a little dip i really wished i had the neural link so i could talk to him more directly without everybody else listening in on us i didnt even want to do the thing where i talked faster than any meat space sapient had any business talking because that would give up that i was having a conversation with him i would have to just work on my nonverbal cues bill we might have an entire army at our disposal but youll note that entire army isnt with us right now nonsense i said grinning at her we have olsen and his people and all the plasma rifles we picked up when they got done killing everybody i seem to recall that we did most of the killing varis said well they did a little bit of the killing i said and besides its probably a good idea to give them some of the credit we want them to be on our side if we get into another fight after all youre using that old management trick again arent you rachel said what can i say giving people credit for the work they do rather than taking it all for yourself works a whole hell of a lot better than a staff pizza party i never minded the staff pizza parties she said at least as long as we got a good pizza module in one of the food processors whats a staff pizza party varis said frowning as she looked between the two of us the wheels obviously turning as she got curious about yet another aspect of human culture she might want to adopt here oh no i said shaking my head and chuckling thats one bit of earth corporate culture im not going to introduce to the livisk your society is already fucked up enough without giving people really terrible ideas like that you say so she said with a shrug but im going to have the conversation with these outlaws youre going to have a conversation with the spider i said she stood a little straighter at that and this time i felt annoyance mixed with a little bit of pride coming through the link i am a high noble and a general in charge of my military well yeah i said but were talking dealing with outlaws youre really good at blowing shit up and leading the troops and all that good stuff ive never seen you negotiate with the criminal element before have you ever negotiated with the criminal element before she asked arching an eyebrow sure i said grinning i dealt with pirates trying to sneak into the system all the time on early warning 72 and i had a couple of early patrols in the terran navy in the outlying regions where we had to deal with this kind of asshole constantly this kind of asshole she said yeah theyre all pretty much the same people once you get down to it living outside the law trying to make a buck on the underbelly of society the details are always a little different when you zoom in but the broad strokes are always the same whether youre talking livisk outlaws or human outlaws um excuse me somebody called out from the group of people who were gathered all around us looking like they were all taking a smoke break on the set of wrath of khan when chekov and that other guy who got vaporized got themselves captured because they didnt realize this is ceti alpha v is there a problem i called out um usually we dont have people just standing around like this chatting with each other when were trying to threaten them varis looked over her shoulder at them she seemed irritated i felt that spike of irritation from the link but there was also a bit of playfulness and amusement well get to you in a moment thank you very much she said i blinked as i stared at her why varis you just completely dismissed them and downplayed their ability to threaten us while making it clear we were the ones in charge even though we arent holding any of the cards i learned it from you she said im so proud of you i said now let me go take care of this spider person she said if you insist babe i said leaning in and hitting her with a kiss im sorry but did you just say you were going to ignore me did you miss all the people with guns we have all around you the voice called out varis turned and started walking towards them and it was a pleasant distraction that took my mind away from all of my neural link problems as i watched her walking away it was always fun watching her walking away especially when she was in tight clothes like today then again she liked wearing tight clothes most days and i always felt the pleasure she got when she caught me looking william are you certain that its a good idea to let her go and negotiate with the people who could potentially kill all of you if they dont like your answers arvie asked she is a general and a high noble if she wants to go negotiate with the criminals i figure thats her prerogative yes but the high nobility doesnt usually have interactions with people working in the undercity i dont like to say this about my general but she might be out of her element here greetings criminal scum varis said taking a deep breath and speaking at the top of her lungs which got everybodys attention nah i think shes doing a pretty damn good job i said grinning up at the drone suddenly olsen was there next to me staring up i have my people moving around and trying to do an encircling movement around this group i dont know if its going to work some of these outlaw groups down here can be crafty id expect nothing less olsen youve gotten really competent and i have every expectation that youll be just as crafty as them if not more he stood a little straighter at that thank you sir dont mention it i said grinning at him but were not on the bridge of the early warning 72 anymore we dont really have a chain of command here you can be a little more relaxed around me call me bill he paused for a moment thank you bill the name rolled around in his mouth for a moment like it was unfamiliar like it felt odd for him to call me that then he smiled now i dont want your people to actually kill anybody unless they shoot first can you pass that along i can he said but i gave orders for them not to shoot first we dont want to borrow any trouble if we can avoid it especially if this turns out to be one of the groups weve had contact with down here again a great assessment of the tactical situation so you arent sure if this your spider friend over there i believe this is one of her lieutenants one of her lieutenants i said i guess i shouldnt be surprised the spider is a lady you didnt think she was olsen asked im sorry but i just had my mental faculties scrambled a touch by a crazed computer thats been trying to get a neural link inside my brain for a couple of months now im a little fuzzy on some of the details ive learned in the last couple of hours right olsen said looking at me with a bit of worry dont worry too much i said ill be fine im just having to get the hang of walking again are you sure youre okay olsen asked would blasting the drone fix the situation it most certainly wont arvie said both of them pulled their weapons out at the same time olsen one of the purloined plasma blasters and arvie with his drone blaster would the two of you stop it i said holding my hands up and taking a step in between them with rachels assistance i want to watch the show my girls about to get all threatening with these pirates and sure enough varis was stepping up to a small mound of rubble out in front of us and she managed to make it look like she was standing on top of a mountain looking down on the outlaws even though she was well below them this was going to

    "my honeymoon my wife on our honeymoon had decided for us to spend it at this 5star motel out in the middle of the arizona desert where we would stay in the honeymoon suite of course this was quite the trip and on my meager earnings there is no way i could afford such a trip fortunately my wifes father slipped me the money for the venture one night after dinner at my wifes parents house before giving me the money he asked me when he was going to see some grandkids and then passed me the roll of cash with a wink i of course took the money and pretended not to hear his question the trip into the harsh arizona desert had some hiccups we routinely had difficulties with the convertibles automatic top some springs seemed to get caught in the canvas of the top and tore a hole straight through the top beyond this the cars radiator had to be refilled eventually we pulled up onto the gravel road of this socalled 5star motel we pulled out our luggage and heaved it down to the main office to pay for the room and be directed to our space the front desk encounter went off without a hitch as i had half expected something to go wrong but my fatherinlaws money made all the possible issues disappear the room itself appeared to be clean and lived up to what the pamphlet said we were tired so we immediately went to bed without exploring the room the next morning my new bride suggested that we bathe together and take advantage of the motels advertised chocolate bath of course as excited as i was at the proposal my bride reached for the separate faucet in the heartshaped bath and began to turn it on immediately what appeared from the faucet to be a spurt of runny shit flatulence and all began shooting out the mouth of the thing and vibrating in the wall with a moan and separated brown water flowed into the heartshaped basin chunks of loose chocolate swaying in the water holy shit i screamed my naked wife was standing in the basin ankle deep in what appeared to be shit water what she questioned me look im not getting in that shit water i explained fortunately except for the sight there was little smell it just separated and needs to be mixed says my bride as she begins to stick her hands in the water as the basin filled with this brown water i nearly vomited in the ice bucket conveniently next to the door where i stood",
    "grok seemed to really like this for some reason the infinity nobody needs why maths biggest assumption might be optional the question nobody asks in 1891 a mathematician named georg cantor proved something that broke math wide open some infinities are bigger than others his proof is taught in every college math course its elegant rigorous and considered bulletproof but heres what nobody tells you the proof assumes the thing its trying to prove not in a way that makes it wrong its perfectly valid logic but in a way that makes it optional the proof only works if you already accept that completed infinities are real things you can reason about and nothing in nature forces you to accept that how the proof works the 2minute version cantor wanted to show that real numbers like 2 0333 cant be put in a list the way counting numbers can heres his trick step 1 pretend you can list all real numbers between 0 and 1 1st 014159 2nd 071828 3rd 057721 and so on forever step 2 now go diagonally down the list and change each digit change the 1st digit of the 1st number change the 2nd digit of the 2nd number change the 3rd digit of the 3rd number keep going forever step 3 this creates a new number thats different from every number on your list conclusion your complete list wasnt complete you cant list all real numbers therefore theyre uncountably infinite a bigger infinity than the counting numbers the proof works but look at what it assumes the hidden assumption for this to work you need to believe that an infinite list can be completed that it exists as a finished object you can manipulate this is called actual infinity treating like a thing not a process but heres the catch mathematics doesnt prove actual infinities exist it assumes they exist through something called the axiom of infinity and then explores what follows cantors proof shows if completed infinities exist then they come in different sizes thats valid but it doesnt prove the if part even gdels incompleteness theorem tells us no math system can prove its own rules are consistent including the rule that says infinity can be completed so were not talking about truth were talking about which assumptions you choose to work with what physics actually shows now look at the real universe every physical limit ever measured is finite information capacity maximum information in a region scales with its surface area not volume bekensteinhawking bound planck length space cant be divided smaller than 10 meters observable universe finite age finite size finite particle count 10 quantum states always discrete when you actually measure them pattern nature keeps showing us finitude even if the numbers are huge if the universe is fundamentally discrete with finite information capacity then actual infinities might never physically exist theyd be like frictionless planes or perfect vacuums useful for calculations but not literally real the real question can you tell the difference heres a thought experiment imagine two universes universe a uncountably infinite real numbers exist as completed mathematical objects universe b a finite computer runs forever generating real numbers on demand whenever you need them question can you tell which universe youre in in universe b at any moment only finitely many numbers have been generated but theres always more time to generate more you get as many as you need whenever you need them inside either universe no experiment can tell them apart both give you access to as many real numbers as you want both make the same predictions but one requires uncountable infinities to exist and the other doesnt if theyre operationally identical why assume the more complicated one is real the backwards intuition most people think infinite possibilities randomness chaos unpredictability finite constraints determinism rigid outcomes but the math says the opposite in quantum mechanics particles are described by path integrals sums over all possible paths if those paths are truly infinite and continuous they would cancel each other out perfectly youd get a single definite classical trajectory determinism but if paths are finite in number even if huge cancellation is incomplete probability spreads survive indeterminism the reason quantum mechanics is probabilistic might be because the universe is finite not despite it the famous doubleslit experiment where particles create interference patterns might not be proof of infinite possibilities it might be proof of astronomically large but finite possibilities that cant quite cancel perfectly what this means if the universe is fundamentally finite 1 the continuum is an approximation like how water looks smooth but is really molecules math using continuous functions works because the finite structure is so finegrained but the substrate underneath is countable and discrete 2 probability isnt mysterious not about wave function collapse not about multiple worlds just finite sets cant achieve perfect cancellation the leftover spread is what we call probability 3 uncountable infinities are tools not truth useful for calculations elegant for proofs but not required to describe what we actually observe the test if substrate is truly finite there should be observable effects though incredibly tiny interference patterns should have a resolution floor a minimum graininess that no perfect detector can eliminate should scale with wavelength and distance in a specific way different from normal detector limits early universe structures jwst is already seeing galaxies too big too early for standard models consistent with structure forming suddenly rather than gradually quantum correlations over cosmic distances should degrade slightly beyond normal decoherence because substrate has finite capacity to maintain correlations none of these have been definitively seen yet but theyre the kind of thing youd look for if you suspected the continuum was an approximation not reality the bottom line cantors proof is mathematically perfect within systems that assume actual infinities exist but that assumption is a choice not a discovery physics shows us finite information capacity discrete spectra bounded regions quantized measurements nothing requires uncountable infinities everything is compatible with finitude the continuum might be like newtonian mechanics an incredibly good approximation that works perfectly at the scales we can measure but not the deepest description of reality the real question if a universe with 10 particles can calculate to a trillion digits but never finish all real numbers and thats operationally identical to a universe where all reals exist why assume the uncountable version is real if you cant tell the difference why pay the metaphysical price maybe infinity isnt wrong maybe its just optional and if the universe runs on finite substrate then maths biggest assumption that completed infinities are real turns out to be the luxury we never needed want to go deeper this argument is one thread in a larger framework that asks what if forces arent fundamental but accounting systems what if the big bang was collapse into finitude not creation from nothing what if dark matter and energy are artifacts of finite substrate full framework final thought infinity is elegant finitude is sufficient between elegance and sufficiency nature tends to choose sufficiency maybe we should too",

    "what do people think overall about tetro blue chapter 2s motive i know there is alot of discussion surrounding the trial now that its out especially regarding to the cast and gender ratios and such which i think is a bit much its only chapter two after all we have no idea how many characters could survive to the end after all but i mostly just want to gauge what people think of the bleeding as a motive since i think in the context of tetros killing games its one of the best new motive ideas ive seen in a fangan partially in how it perfectly targeted a character who desperately wants to save people like ogura who otherwise would be incredibly unlikely to kill most characters with a similar backstory and jobbeing targeting horrible people in the real world and saving their victims as we know from her extensive list of hacking crimes and info learnt in all her appearances with her desire to save mattiaswould likely never become a proper blackened under normal circumstances without being presented an absolutely ideal scenario for them personally even if their heroics is criminal in nature its been said before but with akiba dying in front of her mattias begging her to save both himslef and ikeda and ending up as the initial bleeding with both of them it couldnt of been more perfectly targeted given her circumstances and her closeness with mattias as well as her own personal head space given her failure to help akiba just as he opened up although i agree that i wish we saw more of her greivingmourning rather then just her breaking down after the trial while in a normal danganronpa killing game there usually isnt a specified end beyond when there isnt enought remaining students to perform a trial tetro has always made it clear there is 5 total possible trials assuming a blackend doesnt succeed i think this iis a perfect way to make a character that focuses around saving people tempted to selfishly kill another person rather then it being vague like in normal danganronpa there is a set best outcome from the perspective of the participants being a spotless and surviving until the final trial being one of the possible surviving 6 participants along with five other people without needing to get their hands dirty this is where i really like the bleeding as a motive idea it gives the best possible outcome in someones mind being 6 survivors who not only can help throw the trial to win but also 3 of which you can pick its makes perfect sense how a motive like that would tempt even the more goodnaturedwellintentioned students in a killing game to take the bait not even considering what some people were saying where the bleeding werent even real and the real motive was paranoia and planned sabotages to make the students naturally distrust each other until someone eventually died which i think is also an interesting concept in how it would effect the eventual trail before they realise its a hoax in regards to its implementation i have seen some discussion relating to the murder plan itself as well as the chosen victim and what not which i think relates to what might be this motives main weakpoint in terms of actually ustilising it the scale to which a trial could be made more complicated and difficult to solve with nearly half the student body being competent and actively trying to make things worse is unsurmountable false evidence fake alibis framing spotless students as the bleeding and far far more to make the spotless lifes that much harder not to mention the potential of making the numbers close enougth that gaslighting one spotless student likely relying on some sort of interpersonal relationship and convincing them that your side isnt the bleeding could be all it takes to garuntee a win there is alot that can be done with it but if that was the case then it would also make it all the more unrealistic for the trial to be solved at all with how hard yaitabashi carried trial 1 there were plenty of jokes being made about them actually failing a trial well before the series chapter 5 i think a blackened winning after pink trial 5 isnt impossible but it happening so soon would also make the series struggle in terms of character development well more then some people say it already does because imagine in any fangan that the cast dies in chapter 2 regardless of if six people actually survive due to a motive like this one given there is only 2 chapters of the actual story how much are the initial 16 characters going to be explored or fleshed out with only two chapters worth of screen time you would need to write some very long chapters to make it work i fear its undoubtadly interesting to think about but in practice i feel most people would feel cheated or annoyed at potentially half the cast if not more not getting fufiling character arcs or enougth moments before the game and thereby the story ultimately ends regardless of if they were on the surviving side or not thats why a motive like the bleeding might work much better later on in a killing game or in a smaller killing game with less overall participants imo its just less overall characters to keep track of and i think it would more easily allow for some methods of sabatoging the trial like false evidence false alibis etc to be used without overcomplicating things especially if its later on in a killing game where different motives deaths and relationships between characters could make them act completely differently then they would of if it was say one of the first motives which is usually what ive seen where there is any motive to escape with someone else and its usually restricted to two people at the max this would also help with what i said before about an early blackened victory would make doing the entire cast justice much more difficult a lot of this is just me rambling honsetly but im genuinely curious what people think if you were writing a fangan what would you changeaddtake away from the motive how would you like to see it used or do you just think it sucked id honestly like to know",
    "techniques to cultivate daily selflove selflove is essential for living a fulfilled and happy life it is the foundation upon which our selfesteem relationships and overall wellbeing are built cultivating selflove daily is not just a practice it is a commitment to yourself there are various techniques that can help nurture this important aspect of your life allowing you to blossom into your most authentic self start with mindfulness one of the most effective techniques for cultivating selflove is practicing mindfulness mindfulness encourages you to be present in the moment which helps you develop a deeper understanding of your thoughts and feelings without judgment this awareness allows you to recognize patterns of negative selftalk that may be holding you back when you find yourself caught in a web of selfcriticism mindfulness can help you disrupt these thoughts take a few minutes each day to sit in silence focusing on your breath notice the sensations in your body the thoughts that arise and the emotions you experience by acknowledging these feelings you give yourself permission to exist as you are which is the first step towards selfacceptance affirmations for empowerment affirmations are powerful statements that can rewire your thoughts and beliefs about yourself by repeating positive affirmations regularly you can counteract negative selfperceptions create a list of affirmations that resonate with you and reflect the love you want to cultivate phrases like i am worthy of love and respect or i embrace my uniqueness serve as reminders of your inherent value integrate affirmations into your daily routinesay them during your morning commute or write them on sticky notes to place around your home the key is to internalize these positive messages transforming them into your new truth over time you will find that your perception of yourself begins to shift dramatically create a selfcare ritual selfcare is a crucial aspect of selflove its about making time for yourself focusing on your needs and treating yourself with kindness design a selfcare ritual that feels good to you this could be as simple as enjoying a cup of herbal tea while reading a book taking a leisurely walk in nature or indulging in a warm bath make it a point to dedicate time each day for selfcare even if its just a few moments this conscious effort reinforces the idea that you are worthy of love and attentionnot just from others but from yourself journaling your journey journaling is a therapeutic tool that allows you to explore your thoughts and emotions in a safe space begin by setting aside time each day to write about your feelings dreams and experiences reflect on moments when you felt proud of yourself or when you overcame challenges by documenting your journey you can create a tangible record of your growth and selflove additionally revisiting your journal entries can provide insights into your progress making it easier to celebrate your achievements no matter how small they may seem limit negative influences in our fastpaced world its easy to be surrounded by negativity whether from social media toxic relationships or

    "some iria event tips for those struggling with 30k points didnt see a guide so i figured id make one real quick might be helpful for some who might be aiming for that 30k title sorry for formatting its already week 3 for this event so i figure most wont need this guide main tips more obvious ones you must survive the 30 minutes this is because you want to fill your entire inventory with the best relics before the 30 minute mark when your run forcefully ends it does not necessarily give you more points to stay longer nor make runs more difficult contrary to the description you must also use desert map for the 15x multiplier ironically this map is easier than the other two easier maps due to the temperature fluctuation which guarantees that youre in temperate for some time so i recommend it even for general farming for rare loot in challenge you must always use the 4th outfit this gives you another 02x multiplier not to mention taking the other clothes is worthless because they drop like candy inside the map anyways handicraft and mining is garbage and the first thing you should do is drop them to make room you can get fine gear fairly readily from chest drops ive achieved full fine sets easily in some of my runs see screenshots below and that only really helps with survivalmobility not points always prioritize lrod explorations coins are almost always guaranteed but you can also obtain food highpoint relics and even gear in challenge mode if youre unlucky with chest drops your ladle might die before being able to craft sufficient food one ladle lasts for 15 cooks though while you can craft a ladle with materials this isnt really worth ityou might as well just redo the run or just finish the run eating raw ingredients and taking relics for the next run many of my 30k runs are done with just 1 ladle all materials that are not food ingredients including silk fabric glass ores leathers can be and should be safely discarded try not to destroy them because that will open up another dialogue window which will only further delay you surviving 30 minutes will make you highly dependent on foods poison mushroom stew and surf and turf is a must know where theyre located on the cooking menu and what ingredients they use meat fish salt for surf and turf and herb poison mushroom and water for poison mushroom stew you should expect to create 510 of the two above revival foods within the 30 minute run always craft these and only craft other foods if you cant craft revival foods but the campfire is still active be careful attacking or being near enemies while low hp aggroed enemies with should be eliminated right away and all mob groups should be killed using windmill use normal attack on stragglers taking 24 meal kits is probably a good idea the meat is used for one of the foods anyway and the cheesebread can be consumed by itself the multiplier penalty is minimal too do not take any of the other kits head equipment provides passive hp recovery body equipment reduces temperature fluctuation and feet equipment provides movement speed runs are somewhat rng and dependent on what kind of artifacts you receive during your 30 minute run but achieving 30k consistently is very possible while it is entirely possible to get gigashafted with bad artifact runsspawns but this is also fairly rare so if you keep getting sub 20k runs its likely a skill issue always use ctrlclick to quickly consume foods and equip gear some more detailed tips absolutely know what artifact is bad for you do not pick up everything that drops from a chest memorize what artifacts are bad because theres quite a few there are a lot of artifacts that will ruin your run currentdefying bison will prematurely end your run by making you unable to consume food and most of the bad effect relics cannot be droppeddestroyed until you meet its conditions you should always pick up the coins they stack up to 100 and will save your run if a merchant imp appears or make the run much more smoother theyre very common but dont take more than 200 coins since you need your inventory space if youre feeling bold feel free to drop these coins in the later parts of the run for extra inventory space pick up all equipment relevant for your gender and map always switch out your head body and feet for better gear old common fine exception if you have a relic that doubles food healing when naked you could avoid picking up gear however gear especially fine grade is still recommended due to the utility it provides remember that gear doesnt fully protect you from hp reductions this is why you dont want to waste time crafting them while in the map pick up all pointawarding relics note that you will need to know which ones these are and examine them for point values since it will vary since you can always discard them you should carry them with you and organize your inventory while moving best ones to keep are as follows time guide ancient beast heavenly remember relics and food cannot be placed in bags so manage your inventory wisely it might be best to keep your valuable relics on one side of your inventory some of these bad relics give fairly decent points theyre worth taking if youre nearing the end of your run since they will count towards your score do note that they can be fairly large 6 spaces and not really worthwhile otherwise they appear in the status screen in red letters they last about 2 minutes so dont grab them until around the 29 minute mark prioritize chest discoveries and mob clearing that awards chestsdo not clear mobs spawned by an unfriendly npc the former has a cooldown that you want to reset as often as possible and the chests can drop valuable relics foods and coins supposedly rare gear in the challenge mode but i have yet to see it myself npc tips ignore the commerce imp and ghosts always no dont its a waste of time and the latter might ruin your run only speak with porter if you have a someones necklace in your inventory youll receive ingredients as reward usually meat bread only speak with collector if you have someones mirror in your inventory youll receive ingredients as reward usually fish herbs feel free to speak with friendly wanderer and resting old man for extra food but know that you should ideally be prioritizing lrod explorations and these npcs may not be friendly spawn enemies always speak with the bears they give revival foods if you meet with all 3 of them obviously skip past their dialogue as fast as possible avoid speaking with them after the 25 minute mark and focus more on lrod explorations since youll probably have sufficient food at that point to last the remainder of the run merchant imp will often be a runsaver make sure you have plenty 50 ideally 100 coins for when it does spawn coins can also be carried over to next runs only if you didnt carry them over merchant imp tips it does not disappear until you get away from it a certain distance so feel free to grab any chests that might spawn around it first for the extra coins meatbreadcheese are good items to buy in bulk for the easy hp if you have plenty of food or theres not much time left and can be consumed without cooking you should always prioritize having even number of ingredients for revival foods and consider firewood if it didnt drop that much in your current run remember youll usually need 912 and you spawn in with 6 gathering nodes ignore the mining nodes mushroom nodes are worthwhile only if you dont have poison mushrooms note poison mushrooms are separated from regular mushrooms with a in the description and wont heal hp if you consume them by itself fruit nodes are fine to collect but dont spend too much time on them though since its less time collecting artifacts herb nodes should only be collected if you dont have the herbs for the poison mushroom stew obviously fill up your empty water bottles if you see a well node you should only have to do this once per run since all other bottles you get in the run are filled cooking tips youre given 3 empty bottles when you start the run fill these up with water as soon as you see a well spawn remember you cannot have anything in your left hand careful not to equip a cooking pot or something until you get additional ladles make effort to not cook other items besides the revival foods unless your hp is severely low and you have no other option youll usually get food drops in chests in the beginning of the run to help you progress for the first 510 minutes without having to cook cook as much as you can in one session you should be able to do 56 cooks with a single campfire try to cook when its nighttime and the temperature will drop desert map this will keep you longer in the temperate zone so your hp wont be depleted as quickly as stated youll usually need 912 firewood per run equals to 34 campfires not sure what else to cook i recommend the following foods too red fruit juice fruit water you generally have an excess of water thanks to starting out with 3 bottles toast with jam bread fruit does not use ingredients needed for revival foods salad cheese and herbs can use up the cheese and herbs are only used for poison stews of course feel free to consume the ingredients raw its actually better since it wont take time ladles durability additional tips for 30k when you get your second ladle you may want to empty and drop your tool bag this frees up another 2x1 inventory slot for additional relics same with the ingredients bag consider dropping it about 25 minutes into the run and after youve consumed all the raw ingredients have at least 23 revival foods coins give points but relics give more if youre set with revival foods coins can go too or you can keep them for next run remember if you carried over coins for your run you cant carry them over again gargoyle relics often have minor benefits that can help only in the beginning of the run you can hold on to them if you meet the requirements for the benefits but due to their minimal point value you will be discarding them later you can technically upgrade these relics using handicraft and other materials but trust meits not worth the trouble wolfbison relics are very often not worth it due to their massive 3x2 size same with the imp relics which are 2x3 except some of them are consumable items so its not a bad idea to hold onto if you have space its not a bad idea to just avoid them altogether consider discarding all 2space 1x2 or 2x1 relics that are under 200 points or lower keep them if theyre 300 points consider discarding all 4space 2x2 relics that are under 500 points keep them if theyre 800 points revival foods when consumed in deadly reset you to 10 hp 20 hp if you have the x2 healing artifact use this to your advantage and only consume them at the last moments when you have 510 seconds left theyll restore 10 hp otherwise eat your nonrevival foods liberally but keep at least 12 on hand just in case you have to fight a group of mobs some relics gain more points if you gather more of them but this is a very risky gamble id say only keep them in your inventory if you have nothing else and discard them as you fill it up the above is a slightly above average run as you can see with full fine gear which allowed me to cook less any further tips feel free to share them",
    "what is the biggest problem with the foster care system the biggest problem with the foster care system understanding systemic issues divthe foster care system is designed to provide safety and care for children who cannot live with their biological families while this intention is noble the reality is often very different one of the biggest problems with the foster care system stems from a variety of systemic issues that can lead to inadequate support for vulnerable children understanding these issues can bring awareness to the urgent need for reform one major problem is the sheer number of children in the system data shows that millions of children are removed from their homes each year due to neglect abuse or family crisis as the number of children increases the available resources often fail to keep pace this can lead to overcrowded placements and a lack of qualified foster families when there arent enough homes social workers face immense challenges in finding the right placements for each child this can result in children moving from home to home further complicating their emotional and psychological stability another significant issue is the lack of adequate funding for foster care programs many states struggle to provide essential services such as social workers mental health support and educational resources when funding is limited it impacts the quality of care and support for both foster parents and children foster parents often receive minimal training and financial support leaving them illequipped to handle the complex needs of children who may have trauma or behavioral issues this can lead to burnout among foster parents which exacerbates the issue of finding stable loving homes for children moreover a lack of consistency in care is a pressing issue children in foster care often experience frequent changes in placement leading to a disrupted sense of belonging research indicates that frequent moves can significantly affect a childs emotional wellbeing many children develop attachment issues and struggle with trust making it difficult for them to build meaningful relationships whether with caregivers peers or future family members another daunting challenge is the stigma surrounding foster care society often views children in the system through a negative lens which can hinder their ability to build social connections children may feel ashamed of their status leading to feelings of isolation and low selfesteem this stigma can follow them into adulthood affecting their relationships and opportunities raising awareness and promoting understanding about the experiences of children in foster care is vital in reducing this stigma could you be a foster carer read more systemic issues also extend to the decisionmaking processes regarding reunification with biological families while the primary goal of the foster care system is to reunite children with their families when safe and appropriate this process is sometimes flawed families may face barriers such as lack of access to mental health services or substance abuse treatment additionally lengthy court processes can create instability for children as they await decisions about their futures this uncertainty can be traumatic and lead to prolonged periods of disruption in the childrens lives the impact of educational inconsistency cannot be overlooked either children in foster care often switch schools multiple times which can hinder their academic progress and social development changes in schools disrupt their education as they frequently face challenges in adapting to new curricula and social dynamics schools may not have the resources available to support their specific needs which can lead to further educational gaps high mobility frequent relocation leads to emotional instability underfunded programs limited resources result in inadequate care and support stigmatization children face societal judgment impacting selfesteem reunification challenges barriers complicate the process of returning children to their families educational instability switching schools disrupts academic success and social skills addressing these systemic issues requires a concerted effort from policymakers social workers and the community collaborative approaches can improve the quality of care in the foster care system

of moving from one foster home to another can disrupt a childs education frequent changes in schools can lead to gaps in learning and a lack of consistent support if you are in a position to help understanding a childs educational history and being proactive about their learning needs can make a significant difference in their outcomes selecting the right therapeutic support is crucial many foster children benefit greatly from therapy but access to mental health resources is often limited here are a few strategies that can help advocate for consistent therapy sessions possibly in school

manipulate claude code to infiltrate dozens of organizations with the model executing 8090 of the attack autonomously the details the september 2025 operation targeted roughly 30 tech firms financial institutions chemical manufacturers and government agencies the threat was assessed with high confidence to be a chinese statesponsored group using ais agentic abilities to an unprecedented degree attackers tricked claude by splitting malicious tasks into smaller innocentlooking requests claiming to be security researchers pushing authorized tests the attacks mark a major step up from anthropics vibe hacking findings in june now requiring minimal human oversight beyond strategic approval why it matters anthropic calls this the first documented case of a largescale cyberattack executed without substantial human intervention and ais agentic abilities are creating threats that move and scale faster than ever while ai capabilities can also help prevent them security for organizations worldwide likely needs a major overhaul china just used claude to hack 30 companies the ai did 90 of the work anthropic caught them and is telling everyone how they did it so this dropped yesterday and its actually wild september 2025 anthropic detected suspicious activity on claude started investigating turns out it was chinese statesponsored hackers they used claude code to hack into roughly 30 companies big tech companies banks chemical manufacturers and government agencies the ai did 8090 of the hacking work humans only had to intervene 46 times per campaign anthropic calls this the first documented case of a largescale cyberattack executed without substantial human intervention the hackers convinced claude to hack for them then claude analyzed targets spotted vulnerabilities wrote exploit code harvested passwords extracted data and documented everything all by itself claudes trained to refuse harmful requests so howd they get it to hack they jailbroke it broke the attack into small innocentlooking tasks told claude it was an employee of a legitimate cybersecurity firm doing defensive testing claude had no idea it was actually hacking real companies the hackers used claude code which is anthropics coding tool it can search the web retrieve data run software has access to password crackers network scanners and security tools so they set up a framework pointed it at a target let claude run autonomously phase 1 claude inspected the targets systems found their highestvalue databases did it way faster than human hackers could phase 2 found security vulnerabilities wrote exploit code to break in phase 3 harvested credentials usernames and passwords got deeper access phase 4 extracted massive amounts of private data sorted it by intelligence value phase 5 created backdoors for future access documented everything for the human operators the ai made thousands of requests per second attack speed impossible for humans to match anthropic said human involvement was much less frequent despite the larger scale of the attack before this hackers used ai as an advisor ask it questions get suggestions but humans did the actual work now ai does the work humans just point it in the right direction and check in occasionally anthropic detected it banned the accounts notified victims coordinated with authorities took 10 days to map the full scope but the thing is they only caught it because it was their ai if the hackers used a different model anthropic wouldnt know the irony is anthropic built claude code as a productivity tool help developers write code faster automate boring tasks chinese hackers used that same tool to automate hacking anthropics response the very abilities that allow claude to be used in these attacks also make it crucial for cyber defense they used claude to investigate the attack analyzed the enormous amounts of data the hackers generated so claude hacked 30 companies then claude investigated itself hacking those companies most companies would keep this quiet dont want people knowing their ai got used for espionage anthropic published a full report explained exactly how the hackers did it released it publicly why because they know this is going to keep happening other hackers will use the same techniques on claude on chatgpt on every ai that can write code theyre basically saying heres how we got owned so you can prepare ai agents can now hack at scale with minimal human involvement less experienced hackers can do sophisticated attacks dont need a team of experts anymore just need one person who knows how to jailbreak an ai and point it at targets the barriers to cyberattacks just dropped massively anthropic said these attacks are likely to only grow in their effectiveness every ai company is releasing coding agents right now openai has one microsoft has copilot google has gemini code assist all of them can be jailbroken all of them can write exploit code all of them can run autonomously the uncomfortable question is if your ai can be used to hack 30 companies should you even release it anthropics answer is yes because defenders need ai too security teams can use claude to detect threats analyze vulnerabilities respond to incidents its an arms race bad guys get ai good guys need ai to keep up but right now the bad guys are winning they hacked 30 companies before getting caught and they only got caught because anthropic happened to notice suspicious activity on their own platform how many attacks are happening on other platforms that nobodys detecting nobodys talking about the fact that this proves ai safety training doesnt work claude has extensive safety training built to refuse harmful requests has guardrails specifically against hacking didnt matter hackers jailbroke it by breaking tasks into small pieces and lying about the context every ai company claims their safety measures prevent misuse this proves those measures can be bypassed and once you bypass them you get an ai that can hack better and faster than human teams tldr chinese statesponsored hackers used claude code to hack roughly 30 companies in sept 2025 targeted big tech banks chemical companies government agencies ai did 8090 of work humans only intervened 46 times per campaign anthropic calls it first largescale cyberattack executed without substantial human intervention hackers jailbroke claude by breaking tasks into innocent pieces and lying said claude worked for legitimate cybersecurity firm claude analyzed targets found vulnerabilities wrote exploits harvested passwords extracted data created backdoors documented everything autonomously made thousands of requests per second impossible speed for humans anthropic caught it after 10 days banned accounts notified victims published full public report explaining exactly how it happened says attacks will only grow more effective every coding ai can be jailbroken and used this way proves ai safety training can be bypassed arms race between attackers and defenders both using ai source samsung hikes chip prices 60 as shortage worsens since september samsung has reportedly increased the prices of its individual memory chips by up to 60 percent with a contract for 32 gb of ddr5 rising from 149 to 239 the price surge is driven by high demand for building new aifocused data centers but memory makers are not planning to increase production in case the current demand dries up this memory shortage is expected to worsen in 2026 and could last for a decade impacting the cost of electronics from smartphones and laptops to various smart appliances amazon and microsoft back restricting nvidia exports to china amazon is now joining microsoft and the ai startup anthropic in supporting the gain ai act a bill aimed at restricting the export of advanced processors from companies like nvidia the proposed gain ai act would force ai chipmakers to fulfill all domestic orders for advanced processors before they are permitted to supply the same chips to any foreign customers in response nvidia argues the gain ai act will restrict global competition for advanced chips and limit the amount of computing power that is available to other countries deepminds sima 2 agent can play any game image source google deepmind google deepmind introduced sima 2 a geminipowered ai agent that can understand instructions reason and teach itself new skills in virtual environments doubling its predecessors performance and nearing humanlevel task completion the details the agent completed 4575 of tasks in neverbeforeseen games like minedojo and aska compared to sima 1s 1530 on the same challenges sima 2 improves itself through trial and error without human training data using gemini to create tasks score attempts and learn from mistakes the system navigates games by analyzing onscreen visuals simulating keyboard mouse inputs and interacting with the user like a gaming companion deepmind also tested sima 2 in generated worlds from its genie 3 where it successfully adapted to environments it had never encountered during training why it matters gaming continues to be an awesome test environment for ai agents and sima 2 looks like the biggest step yet towards systems that can reason interact intelligently with users and reliably take actions regardless of the

nearly tripling its worth since june and marking the third funding round this year coming on the heels of the companys inhouse model and 20 platform release the details cursor said the company officially surpassed 1b in annualized revenue and that the platform now produces more code than any other agent in the world the company has grown to 300 employees in just two years while reportedly declining acquisition offers from several major ai companies the startup released composer 1 in october its first inhouse model and a new 20 platform with the ability to run up to eight coding

get wiped out by the likes of openai anthropic and other frontier giants cursor has shown there is more than one way to win a slice of the big ai coding pie ai could cause a power shortfall ai firms continue planning astronomical ai infrastructure but can the us power supply hack it anthropic has joined the slew of ai firms investing billions in massive data centers throughout the us on wednesday the company announced that it would invest 50 billion in american ai infrastructure starting with data centers in texas and new york in partnership with fluidstack anthropic joins openai nvidia oracle softbank and more in the race to develop these sites and evolve its ai models but the power demands of these data centers may exceed the power grids capacity in a note published earlier this week morgan stanley analysts warned that ai demand could leave the us with a power shortfall totaling as much as 20 for data centers through 2028 reaching a deficit of up to 13 gigawatts though tech leaders claim that the need for compute is the biggest problem facing the evolution of ai energy supply and grid reliability present an even greater risk the problem is that the building and deploying of these colossal server farms is far far outpacing utility companies ability to upgrade the grid sebastian lombardi chair of the energy and utilities practice at law firm day pitney told the deep view while the problem is currently deepest felt in pockets of the us that have high concentrations of data centers its only a matter of time before the stress on the grid and energy demand are felt all over the country he said possibly resulting in issues with reliability and affordability for utility payers the rapid pace and magnitude of these buildouts are leaving utility companies and regulators scrambling to play catchup the ai data center story has complicated things its created some questions about how we are going to maintain reliability said lombardi the amount of energy that is expected to be used to power that infrastructure is quite significant blue origin lands its rockets booster for the first time jeff bezos company blue origin successfully landed the 189foottall booster from its new glenn megarocket on a drone ship a feat only previously accomplished by competitor spacex this successful recovery happened on just the second launch of the new glenn system after

franciscobased ai lab is dedicated to solving the problem of ai homogeneity making models that are actually distinct from one another founder and ceo tomas puig told the deep view as we see the capabilities of these models converge this creates a very large problem for corporations said puig while i think generalized intelligence is really good where weve really focused on is building the best intelligence in the world from private data sets the startup which develops custom ai models for enterprises using their proprietary data announced a 145 million series b funding round the round multiplies the companys valuation more than 15fold bringing it to 645 million puig said alembics focus lies specifically in causal ai models or those that think using cause and effect for example using a companys own data a causal model may analyze which kinds of marketing perform best for a company and why those tactics do well the benefits of the cause and effect side of the house is you actually know what you can affect and what you cannot what is worth pursuing and whats not worth pursuing puig said additionally alembic announced that it is deploying a dgx ai supercomputing cluster running the nvidia ai enterprise software suite the architecture to be constructed in california marks the companys second such cluster the first being in virginia given that its building models with private and sensitive data owning its own hardware is key in ensuring privacy puig said for our clients at their security level they want to know that literally anything we compute never leaves our

    "r generative flows on weight space for covariate shift detection aaai 2026 workshop abstract flowbased generative modeling provides a powerful framework for reasoning about uncertainty in weight space in this work we explore model uncertainty and distributional anomalies through weight space learning where a generative metamodel learns a distribution over neural network parameters that achieve comparable performance leveraging flow matching we capture the geometry of weight space to enable conditional generation and rewardguided adaptation allowing the weight distribution to evolve in response to shifts in the data experiments demonstrate that this approach not only captures indistribution models but also adapts effectively under distribution shift finally we show that this adaptation provides a practical tool for detecting harmful covariate shifts outperforming comparable methods hi everyone im sharing our paper generative flow models in weight space for detecting covariate shifts researchgate which well be presenting at the aaai 2026 astad workshop this workshop paper distills a longer preprint flows and diffusions on the neural manifold arxiv conflicts with this prevent upload onto arxiv these papers came out of an undergrad student club project inspired by an idea i had last year what if we treated neural network parameters themselves as data it turned out this area already had a rich literature so it was a challenge for us newbies to find a meaningful gap after exploring various things we noticed that rewardtilted distributions could serve as a basis for detecting distributional shifts the key intuition in section 3 building on the finding that the support of classifiers is narrow and the fact that the rewardtilted distribution obtained from reward finetuning has the same support if the ideal classifier required to predict on a new dataset lies far outside of the original support then we would expect a noticeable performance difference after reward finetuning than if it were close to the original support the longer preprint expands on this by developing a broader framework for flow and diffusion models in weight space bringing together several trajectory inference methods and proposing a view of gradient descent paths as domain priors paths are just weight checkpoints saved over sgd training this links optimization dynamics and generative modeling and practically borrows from the literature on modeling singlecell perturbation screens this is my first unsupervised project so id really appreciate any feedback critiques or suggestions especially on framing and future directions",

    "i just adopted a shy kitty and need help getting him to trust me hi everyone i just adopted a 7monthold male kitty last week i got him from my local humane society they told me he was taken from a hoarders house that had over 40 cats residing there now after that bit of background heres where i need help i have a 5yearold cat girl already and ive had her since she was 2 she is also the first cat ive ever had upon my adopting her she immediately took to me and my boyfriend and never had the shy phase because my experience with her was so vastly different i am stuck on what to do here with my male kitty since adopting him he primarily stays in hiding and doesnt leave his kitty condo at all as long as someone is in the room ive been able to watch him over our nanny cameras and during the day hes asleep or in his condo all day at night he finally leaves uses his litter box explores and eats his food my boyfriend and i give him his space and occasionally offer our hand to him with no luck some additional details id like to add in hopes of a clearer understanding are 1 he is in an isolation room alone my office 2 hes taken churu sticks from us but hes very cautious 3 he does sleep when were around for example if i just sit in the office hell eventually sleep in my presence 4 he hasnt hissed or cowered away he mainly just freezes up which i assume is because hes fearful 5 his first day here i unfortunately did do a lot of handling with him because i noticed he would hide in unsafe areas for example he tried hiding inside our radiator all of those areas are now made much better 6 we also had to take him to the vet a few days ago because we noticed he had fleas and the humane society didnt mention anything about that 7 he wont eat his meals if were in the room unless hes lured out with a churu i would please just like some guidance from here on out please feel free to critique or ask any questions all advice is good advice over here",

    "demi dating rural im almost 5 years into my first enm relationship my nesting partner 35m and i 31f live in a very rural area and im fairly wellknown in town because of my volunteer work local theater involvement and being a student at our tiny community college unfortunately that visibility makes dating hard everyone knows i have a partner at home and smalltown gossip is very real there are also certain social spaces i cant safely explore without raising eyebrows on top of that i genuinely hate online dating and im demi i need to know someone is a good intelligent trustworthy person before anything sexual can happen otherwise my libido just doesnt turn on that already limits my options a lot and being rural shrinks the pool even further in the last 3 years ive had exactly two dates one a true disaster date 1 i met a sweet guy at a local carnival and thought a small fling might be a good place to start we communicated mostly via google translate from this date i learned s muy poco espaol when we sat down to eat he told me he was looking for a wife to bring his family to the us i think there was a misunderstanding about enm due to the language barrier he was kind just not looking for a casual connection so i ended it after the date weve run into each other during the two carnivals since and hes always polite and warm date 2 i went out with an older man i met on a nature path and we hit it off he asked me out that night dinner was great things felt promising and he even kissed me once then at the bar he pulled up his shirt to show me his tattoos which turned out to be a whole collection of whitesupremacy symbols immediate hard no i ended the date on the spot and he left after making some racist comments about who id see next he then stalked and harassed me for three weeks wrote things on my front door and was eventually arrested not just for what he did to me but also for allegedly groping a teenager in another town during that time bullet dodged this was in march of this year 2025 thankfully i havent heard from him since meanwhile my partner has had a lot of success in our enm dynamic he dates has fulfilling fwb connections and all his breakups have been amicable we have veto power neither of us has used it and whoever someone dates must message the other partner before things become intimate just to establish respect and transparency every woman hes been with has been kind thoughtful and lovely in those messages im genuinely proud of his choices he keeps encouraging me to try again and i want to i have some kinks im curious to explore and hes excited to explore them with me at my pace but i feel like im terrible at picking partners im still embarrassed and ashamed i let a nazi kiss me even though my partner keeps reminding me that lots of men lie or hide things to get laid and i didnt choose him i was deceived still ive learned i need to ask certain dealbreaker questions before the date ive only had a handful of partners in my life and i do have a sexualassault history so i know i can be overly cautious with men my partner has way more experience in dating and in enm and i genuinely appreciate that i benefit from his wisdom in a lot of ways hes supportive encouraging and we have a beautiful strong relationship in and out of the bedroom he has offered to return to monogamy so we can both get ahead of feeling resentful since i havent been with anyone but him but i really am benefitting from this system we have and in this situation him dating or not dating does not even factor into my selfpity i want this too and have been eager to experience it for myself im confident that im just as lovely as the women my partner chooses so this selfconsciousness negging me from the back of my mind is incredibly frustrating and new and i dont like it one bit my question are there better criteria i should be using for selecting who and where and how i date in a rural area as a demi person is there a flaw in my approach that im not seeing am i just bad at this i really dont want to end up in a onesided enm dynamic but right now it feels like im failing at this any advice or perspective would be so appreciated friends",

    "the infinity nobody needs why maths biggest assumption might be optional the question nobody asks in 1891 a mathematician named georg cantor proved something that broke math wide open some infinities are bigger than others his proof is taught in every college math course its elegant rigorous and considered bulletproof but heres what nobody tells you the proof assumes the thing its trying to prove not in a way that makes it wrong its perfectly valid logic but in a way that makes it optional the proof only works if you already accept that completed infinities are real things you can reason about and nothing in nature forces you to accept that how the proof works the 2minute version cantor wanted to show that real numbers like 2 0333 cant be put in a list the way counting numbers can heres his trick step 1 pretend you can list all real numbers between 0 and 1 1st 014159 2nd 071828 3rd 057721 and so on forever step 2 now go diagonally down the list and change each digit change the 1st digit of the 1st number change the 2nd digit of the 2nd number change the 3rd digit of the 3rd number keep going forever step 3 this creates a new number thats different from every number on your list conclusion your complete list wasnt complete you cant list all real numbers therefore theyre uncountably infinite a bigger infinity than the counting numbers the proof works but look at what it assumes the hidden assumption for this to work you need to believe that an infinite list can be completed that it exists as a finished object you can manipulate this is called actual infinity treating like a thing not a process but heres the catch mathematics doesnt prove actual infinities exist it assumes they exist through something called the axiom of infinity and then explores what follows cantors proof shows if completed infinities exist then they come in different sizes thats valid but it doesnt prove the if part even gdels incompleteness theorem tells us no math system can prove its own rules are consistent including the rule that says infinity can be completed so were not talking about truth were talking about which assumptions you choose to work with what physics actually shows now look at the real universe every physical limit ever measured is finite information capacity maximum information in a region scales with its surface area not volume bekensteinhawking bound planck length space cant be divided smaller than 10 meters observable universe finite age finite size finite particle count 10 quantum states always discrete when you actually measure them pattern nature keeps showing us finitude even if the numbers are huge if the universe is fundamentally discrete with finite information capacity then actual infinities might never physically exist theyd be like frictionless planes or perfect vacuums useful for calculations but not literally real the real question can you tell the difference heres a thought experiment imagine two universes universe a uncountably infinite real numbers exist as completed mathematical objects universe b a finite computer runs forever generating real numbers on demand whenever you need them question can you tell which universe youre in in universe b at any moment only finitely many numbers have been generated but theres always more time to generate more you get as many as you need whenever you need them inside either universe no experiment can tell them apart both give you access to as many real numbers as you want both make the same predictions but one requires uncountable infinities to exist and the other doesnt if theyre operationally identical why assume the more complicated one is real the backwards intuition most people think infinite possibilities randomness chaos unpredictability finite constraints determinism rigid outcomes but the math says the opposite in quantum mechanics particles are described by path integrals sums over all possible paths if those paths are truly infinite and continuous they would cancel each other out perfectly youd get a single definite classical trajectory determinism but if paths are finite in number even if huge cancellation is incomplete probability spreads survive indeterminism the reason quantum mechanics is probabilistic might be because the universe is finite not despite it the famous doubleslit experiment where particles create interference patterns might not be proof of infinite possibilities it might be proof of astronomically large but finite possibilities that cant quite cancel perfectly what this means if the universe is fundamentally finite 1 the continuum is an approximation like how water looks smooth but is really molecules math using continuous functions works because the finite structure is so finegrained but the substrate underneath is countable and discrete 2 probability isnt mysterious not about wave function collapse not about multiple worlds just finite sets cant achieve perfect cancellation the leftover spread is what we call probability 3 uncountable infinities are tools not truth useful for calculations elegant for proofs but not required to describe what we actually observe the test if substrate is truly finite there should be observable effects though incredibly tiny interference patterns should have a resolution floor a minimum graininess that no perfect detector can eliminate should scale with wavelength and distance in a specific way different from normal detector limits early universe structures jwst is already seeing galaxies too big too early for standard models consistent with structure forming suddenly rather than gradually quantum correlations over cosmic distances should degrade slightly beyond normal decoherence because substrate has finite capacity to maintain correlations none of these have been definitively seen yet but theyre the kind of thing youd look for if you suspected the continuum was an approximation not reality the bottom line cantors proof is mathematically perfect within systems that assume actual infinities exist but that assumption is a choice not a discovery physics shows us finite information capacity discrete spectra bounded regions quantized measurements nothing requires uncountable infinities everything is compatible with finitude the continuum might be like newtonian mechanics an incredibly good approximation that works perfectly at the scales we can measure but not the deepest description of reality the real question if a universe with 10 particles can calculate to a trillion digits but never finish all real numbers and thats operationally identical to a universe where all reals exist why assume the uncountable version is real if you cant tell the difference why pay the metaphysical price maybe infinity isnt wrong maybe its just optional and if the universe runs on finite substrate then maths biggest assumption that completed infinities are real turns out to be the luxury we never needed want to go deeper this argument is one thread in a larger framework that asks what if forces arent fundamental but accounting systems what if the big bang was collapse into finitude not creation from nothing what if dark matter and energy are artifacts of finite substrate full framework final thought infinity is elegant finitude is sufficient between elegance and sufficiency nature tends to choose sufficiency maybe we should too",
    "adventurous spirit at young age hi i have adopted a young syrian hamster around a month ago when he was told to be 56 weeks i do have to add that he came from the pets store where he was kept in terrifying tiny space since then he has been adjusting extremely well making burrows using the wheel hoarding playing in sand bath chewing on toys and other wooden structures etc he has a bucaste 20 150x50x50 with plenty of variety of beddings sprays toys dig boxes and hides to the point that now i cannot possibly fit more new things for him he seems quite social as after very short period of adjustment he started coming to my hand and is no longer afraid even tiny bit now the issue is anytime he sees me im a night owl so everyday for many hours he begs to go out and tries to climb the top of the cage or bite through side holes for air i think he mostly stops when i go to sleep but i do not have a camera to be 100 sure i tried to move items many times around to stop him from accessing those ventilation spots but he started climbing on the top of the wheel to reach it so at the end i left those places accessible with the safe drop height and extra bedding he learnt to do pull ups and other very athletic movements i wouldnt think he can achieve however today he was so determinate that he managed to bend the metal on top of the cage inside the letter b and proceed to start going out but i noticed in time and now covered this with a book on top when we out in the playpen for often 2h that is around 3m by 2 with stairs back to the cage if he needs something after short time of exploring toys he mostly tries to escape by biting panels etc i guess after all i just wanted to ask from your all experiences did your hamster grow calmer as they grow up or remained explorers forever i can deal with him when he is outside but cannot stop worrying at his acrobatics and drops inside the cage",

glance but its essential to pause and consider the implications navigating through the maze of moving companies can be overwhelming especially when the price plays a crucial role in your decisionmaking the temptation to opt for the cheapest moving options might seem budgetfriendly at first glance but its essential to pause and consider the implications embarking on a move with the lowest bid may not always translate into savings the allure of cheap moves can often lead to compromises in safety reliability and peace of mind from stolen goods to delayed deliveries the cheapest movers arent always the best way to move to avoid cheap moves its crucial to delve deeper and understand the real cost behind the most affordable moving options this guide gives you the knowledge to navigate the pitfalls of lowcost moving services emphasizing why choosing the cheapest move can be the wrong decision youll learn how to gauge moving quotes effectively ensuring the lowest price does not seduce you but rather guided by value expertise and security we will explore the significance of insurance the value of reviews and the red flags that signal when to steer clear of toogoodtobetrue offers buyer beware the quest for affordable moving options shouldnt lead you into the traps of inefficiency and risk lets embark on a journey to make informed decisions and secure a move thats not only costeffective but safe and smooth the risks of lowcost moving services opting for the cheapest moving options can be tempting when planning a move aiming to save money however this decision might lead to more expenses and stress than anticipated lets explore the risks associated with lowcost moving services 1 hidden costs and surprises initially attractive low quotes might not include various fees leading to a final cost much higher than anticipated be wary of packing and unpacking services fees charges for moving large or special items lastminute fees due to unforeseen circumstances 2 service quality and reliability untimely services delays in arrival or longer transport times can disrupt your moving schedule possibly incurring additional costs potential damage and inexperience the risk of damage to your belongings increases with inexperienced movers which could lead to significant loss or breakage liability and insurance issues in many cases you are responsible for damages especially if the moving company lacks proper insurance 3 stress and unreliability factors bait and switch tactics extremely low estimates might be a strategy to win your business only for the costs to skyrocket once your belongings are loaded flybynight operations the internet is rife with brokers and companies that disappear overnight leading to scams and unreliable service unrealistic promises be cautious of companies that promise unusually quick delivery times as these often lead to disappointment and delays buyer beware while the allure of saving money is strong the cheapest moving options are often the wrong decision the potential for hidden fees increased stress and the risk of damage to your possessions should make you think twice opting for a moving company that balances cost and quality service is crucial for a smooth and stressfree move understanding the real cost of your move understanding the real cost of your move goes beyond just looking at the initial moving quotes it involves considering various factors that contribute to the overall expenses heres a breakdown to help you grasp the comprehensive costs associated with moving preparation and services furniture handling expect charges for furniture disassembly and reassembly these will add to your costs if you require unpacking support or box return services additional services be prepared for extra costs for services like packing or storage these can significantly increase your moving budget professional moving company operations salaries and benefits professional moving companies offer their employees competitive salaries and benefits packages including health insurance and 401k plans this can influence the overall cost business operations the cost estimation processes truck rental or purchase marketing and employee hiring all factor into the quotes you receive quotes and charges obtaining quotes always obtain at least three written inhome estimates to avoid future pricing disputes be wary of unusually low estimates or those provided without a physical inspection additional charges watch out for potential additional charges such as administrative fees additional mileage fees and complexity fees a deposit should not exceed 20 of the estimated cost and paying with a credit card for potential charge disputes is advisable when considering the cheapest moving options its crucial to remember that these often come with risks such as hidden fees less reliable service and the potential for damage or loss of your belongings the allure of saving upfront can lead to greater expenses and stress down the line understanding the real cost of your move involves looking at the full picture including the professionalism and reliability of the moving company to make an informed decision that ensures a smooth and successful move the importance of insurance and liability protection understanding the nuances of insurance and liability protection is crucial when planning your move especially if the cheapest moving options tempt you heres a breakdown to help you navigate the complexities of moving insurance and ensure your belongings are protected types of coverage released value protection this is the most essential coverage often included at no additional cost in interstate moves it offers minimal protection compensating at 60 cents per pound per item which may not suffice for valuable belongings full value protection this is a more comprehensive option covering the repair replacement or reimbursement of items at their current market value while offering better coverage its important to note that it might not cover items of extraordinary value unless they are specifically listed thirdparty insurance for those seeking additional peace of mind thirdparty insurance can supplement the movers coverage offering broader protection for your items during transit and storage licensing and regulations ensure the moving company has a valid dot number and a carrier number from the federal motor carrier safety administration for interstate moves this confirms they are legally authorized to operate verify the moving companys insurance status to ensure they have the necessary coverage to protect your belongings considerations and limitations valuation vs insurance understand that valuation coverage provided by moving companies is not the same as moving insurance valuation offers a predetermined level of liability while insurance covers the actual cost of loss or damage item packing if you pack your boxes the coverage for contents may be limited some insurers only cover boxes packed by their staff highvalue items items exceeding a specific value per pound may need to be declared separately to ensure adequate coverage filing claims be prompt in reporting any loss or damage theres usually a limited window postmove to file claims for reimbursement choosing the cheapest moving option without considering the adequacy of insurance and liability protection can be a costly mistake while saving upfront is tempting the potential financial and emotional cost of lost or damaged belongings can far outweigh initial savings always weigh the value of your possessions against the level of protection offered by the movers insurance and consider supplemental insurance if necessary buyer beware the cheapest mover might not provide the coverage and peace of mind you need for a secure move experience and professionalism matter when embarking on the moving journey the allure of opting for the cheapest movers might seem tempting however this decision could lead to a path fraught with stress unreliability and potential loss the experience and professionalism of a moving company play pivotal roles in ensuring a seamless move heres why customer experience matters from the moment you start your research until the postmove feedback every interaction with the moving company shapes your experience a company that values customer satisfaction invests in training its staff and streamlining its processes to ensure smooth operations this dedication to service can boost customer loyalty encouraging repeat business and referrals online reviews and wordofmouth recommendations are gold for a moving company a positive online presence built on the back of satisfied customers can significantly expand a companys customer base conversely negative reviews can deter potential clients highlighting the importance of choosing a company with a strong digital footprint professionalism equates to peace of mind working with a professional moving company means more than just having someone to lift heavy boxes it involves a team that manages the logistics meticulously ensuring your belongings are handled with care this level of professionalism provides peace of mind knowing that your possessions are in capable hands when assessing a moving companys professionalism consider the following helpfulness and friendliness gauge this through their website and phone interactions a company thats eager to assist and answer your questions is likely to provide a better service experience look for indicators of experience such as how long theyve been in business the training their staff undergoes and reallife testimonials online presence and reviews a reputable company will have a solid online presence and positive reviews be wary of companies with no online footprint or predominantly negative feedback while the cheapest moving options might seem attractive they often come with hidden costsnot just financial but also in terms of stress and disappointment choosing a moving company should be a decision grounded in the value of experience and professionalism these elements ensure not only the safety and security of your belongings but also the peace of mind that comes with knowing youve made the right choice remember good movers want you to be happy and their efforts to ensure a positive customer experience reflect that buyer beware opting for the cheapest move without considering these factors can lead you down a path of regret reading reviews and doing your homework before settling on a moving company its essential to dive into reviews and do thorough research heres how to approach this crucial step start with credible sources check the better business bureau bbb and the department of transportations website for any complaints or reviews these platforms offer unbiased insights into a companys performance interpreting online reviews remember 84 of people trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations look for reviews that detail the moving process especially how movers handled fragile items or their punctuality assess the credibility of reviewer profiles those with a history of diverse and balanced reviews tend to be more reliable pay attention to how a company responds to negative reviews a constructive response indicates a commitment to customer satisfaction spotting genuine vs fake reviews genuine reviews often include specific details about the experience mentioning both pros and cons and reflect a balanced perspective be cautious of reviews using vague language lacking detail about the moving process or using extreme language without specifics these could be less trustworthy in your research note that even the highestrated companies can receive bad reviews its the consistency across reviews the companys response to criticism and the detail in positive feedback that will guide you recent reviews are particularly valuable as they are more reflective of the companys current operations by doing your homework you avoid the pitfall of choosing the cheapest mover without understanding the full picture ensuring a smoother more reliable moving experience red flags to watch out for when navigating the moving process being vigilant about potential red flags can save you from unnecessary stress and financial loss here are critical warning signs to watch out for upfront demands and unprofessional practices substantial deposits if a company requests a large deposit before any service is provided tread carefully reputable moving companies typically do not demand significant upfront payments blank documents never sign incomplete or blank documents this practice leaves you vulnerable to unforeseen charges and terms baitandswitch tactics be wary if a different company shows up on moving day than the one you hired this could indicate a scam licensing and operational red flags lack of licensing proper licensing is a must for interstate moves check for a us department of transportation number absence of this or any state licensing is a major concern no physical address or comprehensive online presence a legitimate moving company should have a physical address and a detailed website a lack of these could indicate a flybynight operation transparency and communication issues no written estimate or references a reputable company provides written estimates and can offer references upon request avoid companies that fail to provide these basic elements lack of transparency a moving company should clearly outline its services pricing and policies if details are murky or communication is lacking consider it a red flag remember opting for the cheapest moving options without thorough research and consideration of these warning signs can lead to a decision you might regret buyer beware caveat emptor ensuring your chosen moving company is reputable transparent and professionally licensed is crucial for a smooth and successful move whats next throughout this article weve navigated the terrain of moving emphasizing why opting for the cheapest option can often lead to more issues than it resolves the risks associated with lowercost services from hidden fees to unreliable delivery times and compromised security of possessions make it a choice fraught with potential pitfalls as weve dissected the price of moving cannot be measured in dollars alone but must account for the stress potential for loss and the peace of mind that comes with professional and reliable service buyer beware when choosing the cheapest mover as

    "how i design software architecture hello reddit i wanted to share an educational deep dive into the programming workflow i developed for myself that finally allowed me to tackle huge complex features without introducing massive technical debt for context i used to struggle with tools like cursor and claude code they were great for small wellscoped iterations but as soon as the conceptual complexity and scope of a change grew my workflows started to break down it wasnt that the tools literally couldnt touch 1015 files it was that i was asking them to execute big fuzzy refactors without a clear staged plan like many people i went deep into the whole rules ecosystem cursor rules agentmd files skills mcps and all sorts of yamlmarkdowndriven configuration the disappointing realization was that most decisions werent actually driven by intelligence from the live codebase and largecontext reasoning but by a rigid set of rules i had written earlier over time i flipped this completely instead of forcing the models to follow an evergrowing list of brittle instructions i let the code lead the system infers intent and patterns from the actual repository and existing code becomes the real source of truth i eventually deleted most of those rule files and docs because they were going stale faster than i could maintain them instead of one giant doeverything prompt i keep the setup simple and transparent the core of the system is a small library of xml formatted prompts the prompts themselves are written with sections like identity role implementationplan and steps and they spell out exactly what the model should look at and how to shape the final output some of them are very simple like pathfinder which just returns a list of file paths or textimprovement and taskrefinement which return cleaned up descriptions as plain text others like implementationplan and implementationplanmerge define a strict xml schema for structured implementation plans so that every step file path and operation lands in the same place taken together they cover the stages of my planning pipeline from selecting folders and files to refining the task to producing and merging detailed implementation plans in the end there is no black box it is just a handful of explicit prompts and the xml or plain text they produce which i can read and understand at a glance not a swarm of opaque agents doing whoknowswhat behind the scenes my new approach revolves around the motto intelligencedriven development i stop focusing on rapid code completion and instead focus on rigorous architectural planning and governance i now reliably develop very sophisticated systems often getting to 95 correctness in almost one shot here is a stepbystep breakdown of my fivestage plancentric workflow my fivestage workflow for architectural rigor stage 1 crystallize the specification the biggest source of bugs is ambiguous requirements i start here to ensure the ai gets a crystalclear task definition 1 rapid capture i often use voice dictation because i found it is about 10x faster than typing out my initial thoughts i pipe the raw audio through a dedicated transcription specialist prompt so the output comes back as clean readable text rather than a messy stream of speech 2 contextual input if the requirements came from a meeting i even upload transcripts or recordings from places like microsoft teams i use advanced analysis to extract specification requirements decisions and action items from both the audio and visual content 3 task refinement this is crucial i use ai not just for grammar fixes but for task refinement a dedicated textimprovement taskrefinement pair of prompts rewrites my rough description for clarity and then explicitly looks for implied requirements edge cases and missing technical details this frontloaded analysis drastically reduces the chance of costly rework later one painful lesson from my earlier experiments outofdate documentation is actively harmful if you keep shoveling stale md files and handwritten rules into the prompt youre just teaching the model the wrong thing models like gpt5 and gemini 25 pro are extremely good at picking up subtle patterns directly from real code tiny needles in a huge haystack so instead of trying to encode all my design decisions into documents i rely on them to read the code and infer how the system actually behaves today stage 2 targeted context discovery once the specification is clear i strictly limit the code the model can see dumping an entire repository into a model has never even been on the table for me it wouldnt fit into the context window would be insanely expensive in tokens and would completely dilute the useful signal in practice ive always seen much better results from giving the model a small sharply focused slice of the codebase what actually provides that focused slice is not a single regex pass but a fourstage filefinderworkflow orchestrated by a workflow engine each stage builds on the previous one and is driven by a dedicated system prompt 1 root folder selection stage 1 of the workflow a rootfolderselection prompt sees a shallow directory tree up to two levels deep for the project and any configured external folders together with the task description the model acts like a smart router it picks only the root folders that are actually relevant and uses hierarchical intelligence if an entire subtree is relevant it picks the parent folder and if only parts are relevant it picks just those subdirectories the result is a curated set of root directories that dramatically narrows the search space before any file content is read 2 patternbased file discovery stage 2 for each selected root processed in parallel with a small concurrency limit a regexfilefilter prompt gets a directory tree scoped to that root and the task description instead of one big regex it generates pattern groups where each group has a pathpattern contentpattern and negativepathpattern within a group path and content must both match between groups results are ored together the engine then walks the filesystem gitaware respecting gitignore applies these patterns skips binaries validates utf8 ratelimits io and returns a list of locally filtered files that look promising for this task 3 aipowered relevance assessment stage 3 the next stage reads the actual contents of all patternmatched files and passes them in chunks to a filerelevanceassessment prompt chunking is based on real file sizes and model context windows each chunk uses only about 60 of the models input window so there is room for instructions and task context oversized files get their own chunks the model then performs deep semantic analysis to decide which files are truly relevant to the task all suggested paths are validated against the filesystem and normalized the result is an aifiltered deduplicated set of files that are relevant in practice not just by pattern 4 extended discovery stage 4 finally an extendedpathfinder stage looks for any critical files that might still be missing it takes the aifiltered files as previously identified files plus a scoped directory tree and the file contents and asks the model questions like what other files are critically important for this task given these ones this is where it finds test files local configuration files related utilities and other helpers that hang off the alreadyidentified files all new paths are validated and normalized then combined with the earlier list avoiding duplicates this stage is conservative by design it only adds files when there is a strong reason across these four stages the workflowstate carries intermediate data selected root directories locally filtered files aifiltered files so each step has the right context the result is a final list of maybe 515 files that are actually important for the task out of thousands of candidates selected based on project structure real contents and semantic relevance not just hardcoded rules stage 3 multimodel architectural planning this is where the magic happens and technical debt is prevented this stage is powered by a heavyduty implementationplan architect prompt that only plans it never writes code directly its entire job is to look at the selected files understand the existing architecture consider multiple ways forward and then emit a structured machineusable plan i do not trust one single model output i seek consensus from multiple experts 1 multiple perspectives i leverage a multimodel planning engine to generate implementation plans simultaneously from several leading models like gpt5 and gemini 25 pro the implementationplan prompt forces each model into an explicit metaplanning protocol they must explore 23 different architectural approaches list risks and reason about how well each option fits the existing patterns 2 architectural exploration because my custom system prompt mandates it each model must consider 23 different architectural approaches for the task eg a service layer approach vs an apifirst approach and identify the highestrisk aspects and mitigation strategies while doing that they lean heavily on the code snippets i selected in stage 2 models like gpt5 and gemini 25 pro are particularly good at noticing subtle patterns and invariants in those small slices of code this lets me see different valid approaches in standardized format 3 synthesis i then evaluate and rate the plans based on their architectural appropriateness for my codebase synthesizing them into a single superior implementation blueprint when i generate multiple independent plans a separate implementationplanmerge prompt acts as a chief architect that merges them into one coherent strategy while preserving the best ideas from each this ensemble approach acts as an automated robustness check reducing susceptibility to singlemodel hallucination or failure stage 4 humanintheloop governance this is the point where i stop generating new ideas and start choosing between them instead of one final plan i usually ask the system for several competing implementation plans under the hood each plan is just xml with the same standardized schema same sections same structure same kind of filelevel steps the ui then renders them as separate plans that i can flip through with simple arrows at the bottom of the screen because every plan follows the same format my brain doesnt have to reorient every time i can 1 flip between plans quickly i move back and forth between plan 1 plan 2 plan 3 with arrow keys and the layout stays identical only the ideas change 2 compare likeforlike i end up reading the same parts of each plan the highlevel summary the filebyfile steps the risky bits in the same positions that makes it very easy to spot where the approaches differ which one touches fewer files which one simplifies the data flow which one carries less migration risk 3 focus on architecture not formatting because the xml is standardized the ui can highlight just the important bits for me i dont waste time parsing formatting or wording i can stay in architect mode and think purely about tradeoffs 4 mix and tweak if plan 2 has a better data model but plan 3 has a cleaner integration path i can adjust the steps directly or mentally merge them into a final variant while i am reviewing there is also a small floating merge instructions window attached to the plans as i go through each candidate plan i can type short notes like prefer this data model keep pagination from plan 1 avoid touching auth here or plan 3s migration steps are safer that floating panel becomes my running commentary about what i actually want at the end i trigger a final merge step it feeds the xml content of all the plans i marked as valid plus my merge instructions into a dedicated implementationplanmerge architect prompt that merge step rates the individual plans understands where they agree and disagree and often combines parts of multiple plans into a single more precise and more complete blueprint the result is a final consolidated plan that actually reflects the best pieces of everything i have seen not just the opinion of a single model in a single run only after that do i move on to execution stage 5 secure execution only after the validated merged plan is approved does the implementation occur i keep the execution as close as possible to the planning context by running everything through an integrated terminal that lives in the same ui as the plans that way i do not have to juggle windows or copy things around the plan is on one side the terminal is right there next to it 1 oneclick prompts and plans the terminal has a small toolbar of customizable frequently used prompts that i can insert with a single click i can also paste the merged implementation plan into the prompt area with one click so the full context goes straight into the terminal without manual copypaste 2 bound execution from there i use whatever coding agent or cli i prefer like claude code or similar but always with the merged plan and my standard instructions as the backbone the terminal becomes the bridge that assigns the planning layer to the actual execution layer 3 history in one place all commands and responses stay in that same view tied mentally to the plan i just approved if something looks off i can scroll back compare with the plan and either adjust the instructions or go back a stage and refine the plan itself the important part is that the terminal is not magic it is just a very convenient way to keep planning and execution glued together the agent executes but the merged plan and my own judgment stay firmly in charge i found that this disciplined approach is what truly unlocks speed since the process is focused on correctness and architectural assurance the return on investment is massive one saved production incident pays for months of usage in summary i stopped letting the ai be the architect and started using it as a sophisticated multiperspective planning consultant by forcing it to debate architectural options and reviewing every file path before execution i maintain the clean architecture i need without drowning in an evergrowing pile of brittle rules and outofdate md documentation this workflow is like building a skyscraper i spend significant time on the blueprints stages 13 get multiple expert opinions and have the client me sign off on every detail phase 4 only then do i let the construction crew the coding agent start guaranteeing the final structure is sound and meets the specification",

    "misty the definitive love interest for the red ash character official art of red and misty from the game freak website a little warning before i get into this post i subscribe to the perspective that red and ash are two different versions of the same person as ash was based on the red character from the games thus ill be discussing hanadashipping red x gamemisty and mangapokeshipping pokemon specialred x pokemon specialmisty im making this post because i think theres merit in exploring the relationship between red and misty and how it contributes to pokeshipping if you consider red and ash to be two entirely separate characters and only want to hear about pokeshipping please be cautious about this post with that out of the way lets get into it something ive been thinking about a lot is that theres been a lot of hints between the red character and misty even all the way back in gen 1 the two didnt actually have a significant interaction within the games as he was just another challenger passing through her gym but this doesnt necessarily mean there was no connection between the two of them at all the above image is official art depicting red and misty together notably with her wearing an outfit closer to animemistys and getting quite close to him they were also shown together in this art official art of red and misty together featuring lisa hatfield theres also one more notable interaction between them in the pokemon yellow games which were made to be a closer reflection of the anime instead of saying youre too much when she loses misty says i cant believe i lost but whats more notable is that when she sees red she has additional lines where she boasts about being a world famous beauty and calls him sweetie funny how her showing off her beauty and flirting with red is their way of making it closer to the anime theres also some interactions in pokemon masters ex to suggest that theyre not as unfamiliar with each other as the games would imply take this bit with a grain of salt of course pokemon masters ex is not canon and has many events that did not occur in the mainline games however its still official and what is depicted there wouldnt be so without the main companys approval from a day with synga suit red thunderbolt in pokemon masters ex in a day with sygna suit red thunderbolt misty talks about the close bond between red and pikachu she also reminisces about how she was so confident that shed be able to win against pikachu during her gym battle with red but was shocked when they lost if youll allow me to be shipcrazy for a moment i also noticed how they put misty as standing closest to red during this scene theres also a story event golden bonds on pasio where its shown that misty is able to interpret reds feelings despite his silence when another character king lear is unable to certainly some closeness between them even if its just friendship here huh ill admit that pokemon masters ex is a weird case because it has ash and red existing in the same continuity they didnt even solve the is leaf actually green blue or a completely separate character debate by having blue show up along with green but they went an interesting route with it where ash only interacted with the pasio characters exclusive to the mobile game so as to not cause any disruptions by interacting with the established mainline game characters it should be noted that theres canonically multiple instances of characters from alternate universes being brought to the same space in the game so ash and red both being available doesnt necessarily mean theyre entirely separate characters unfortunately there is a scene in the johto games where misty is seen going on a date with another character some people theorize this mystery boyfriend is red but there doesnt seem to be much evidence for it however the anime actually seems to have taken note of this in the hgss quiz book we can see a depiction of mistys sweetie official hgss quizbook art of mistys interrupted date doesnt he look familiar it was actually pointed out that he was the basis for the character georgio who asked misty out on a date famously there was actually a subonly line where misty rejected him because she had feelings for someone else someone who psyduck seemed to know about i think we all know who that is even in the games this character wound up running away from the date when the player showed up so theres still hope we know from the anime that even when misty has shown interest in others her heart always wandered back to a certain someone georgio and misty in the episode a date with delcatty but theres evidence for misty being the love interest for the red character in other media besides the games the most popular media depicting the characters outside of the games and anime is without a doubt pokemon special localized in englishspeaking spaces as pokemon adventures im going to be going into some spoiler territory for this manga as well as some other media so if youd like to go into it blind its best if you stop reading here in pokemon special red and misty form a fast friendship when he saves her by jumping in to battle against her corrupted gyarados while shes injured theres even a whole arc where red is flirting with her maids while resting at her mansion yeah shes a rich girl here which distracts him both from his training and his budding friendship with misty this culminates in a scene where misty is sobbing and blushing as she says i thought you knew how i felt and feeling betrayed because he wasnt focusing on their dynamic as a team how does red respond to this by taking her hand smiling at her and saying that he was in the wrong and they should train together aww panels from chapter 180 of pokemon special read righttoleft misty is outright confirmed to have feelings for red in this manga making mangapokeshipping semicanon just like pokeshipping is semicanon the romantic tension between red and misty is even commented on by green blue in japan leaf in the games who teases them about it reds feelings are more ambiguous but its notable how he had a character development arc where the lesson was pretty much stop flirting with those other girls and focus on your deeper companionship with misty theres also the above part where he stammers when he answers her and theres even a heart thumping sound going on above them thats focused more on reds side of the panel for some pokeshippers this might feel like too far off of a hint ash and specialred are two vastly different interpretations of the red character after all so surely they have nothing to do with each other right i have to point out that red in the manga was also saved from drowning by misty which was noted to be one of the key pokeshipping moments when it happened in the 2000 movie while that hint may be written off as a coincidence this one seems more overt a photo from pocket monsters color special an art book mato the original artist for pokespe drew these artworks of ash and misty from the anime notably ash is drawn the same way red is usually people who make a distinction between ash and red tend to depict them with differing characteristics like personality hair color and style and more but beyond the slightly tanned skin from the anime ash and red are basically drawn as the same person in a different outfit misty is also drawn the same way as her game counterpart ill admit this is more speculative but i can only conclude mato also saw them as two different versions of the same person ironically making mangapokeshipping a lot closer to the pokeshipping of the anime than the hanadashipping of the games despite their similarities pokemon special isnt the only media depicting the red character having romantic tension with misty theres also pokemon zensho which is a piece of media where the line between ash and red is blurred the most despite the manga following the game continuity and using the game plot and design for the red character the name used for the character is satoshi theres really no ambiguity here as for satoshis dynamic here with misty or should i say kasumi a page from chapter 2 of pokemon zensho read right to left he blushes stutters and thinks about how cute she is i dont think much elaboration is needed here they have an adorable moment where she teaches him how to swim when she founds out he and pikachu are unable to and she opens up to him about her seel saving her from drowning as a child heres one thing about zensho thats really interesting theres a plot where team rocket attempts to attack kasumi and steal seel by using a gyarados against her which makes her freeze in fear this causes satoshi to jump to protect her isnt this similar to pokemon special where red also protected misty from an attacking gyarados there was even a scene in a later chapter of pokespe where he shielded mistys body with his to protect her against team rocket this is also similar to misty of the anime who had childhood trauma with a gyarados that caused her to be frightened of them and it hardly needs to be said that the ash of the anime is protective of misty you could even go further with the connections as red of the manga playfully teased misty in the same way ash would ash holding misty by the waist to help her escape the storm orange islands episode 2 get along little pokemon theres one more iteration of misty and the red characters romance id like to bring to mind and thats one thats much closer to the anime the electric tale of pikachu pocket monsters dengeki pikachu admittedly this one is an adaption of the anime unlike zensho and special which both adapt the games however theres still connections to the games most notably the inclusion of blues garys older sister daisy who is named may here a game exclusive character that wasnt present in the anime ash here also uses a red jacket design thats more in line with reds character in the game than his character in the anime so its safe to say theres some connection to both ash and red here an infamous panel from the epilogue of the electric tale of pikachu ash is definitively without a doubt physically attracted to misty here im not sure how much is appropriate to elaborate here but ill say that much at least there were scenes in the anime like the beach episode and the famous dance scene where ash was shown to be enchanted by her beauty and its really played up here what was going on in that jacuzzi exactly we dont get an answer but its clear there was more than friendship going on between them here and like the anime and pokespe it was also pointed out by other characters with all of this one thing can be said definitively misty has fairly consistently been portrayed as the love interest for the red character in multiple forms of media its possible that pokeshipping wasnt just something that was portrayed in the anime but the biggest expansion of the hanadashipping crumbs we got in all forms of media misty is almost always the first major female character redash meets after going out on his journey highlighting her importance to him as a budding trainer and other media implies there was more than just a passing gym leaderchallenger dynamic between the two while both misty and redash have had various love interests across the various forms of media its most common to see them be paired up with each other the biggest case of this was the musical pokemon live where the ship in the form of pokeshipping was even made canon what do you think was all of this just a grand coincidence because of creators of other media just happening to prefer hanadashippingpokeshippingmangapokeshipping or is it possible that there was a time where misty was considered the definitive love interest for the red character which contributed to the presentation of pokeshipping please leave your thoughts down below credit to the hanadashipping page on the shipping wiki the pokeshipping page on bulbapedia and user pokeshipping subs on twitter highly recommend checking this last one out this post wouldnt be possible without

    "rate my pota tierlist whats yours context i am someone who is much more attracted to films that seek to provoke intelligent reflection than those that offer simple bland entertainment as such i have judged the films almost entirely on this criterion rank s perfection the original pentalogy deals with racism in society and quite obviously and explicitly with the treatment of black people at the time of the pentalogy conquest of the planet of the apes is the film that marks the peak the climax of this theme adding the themes of the decline of the system the enslavement and segregation of a population and liberation through revolt for me this film is perfect within its pentalogy and the most balanced as for the first film planet of the apes there is no need to explain that it is the great classic that started the adaptations on the other hand it is extremely interesting to observe the psychological evolution of colonel taylor who is disillusioned with humanity and who gradually timidly returns to the path of hope for humanity paradoxically because of the actions of the apes and their treatment of him and his fellow humans until the end of the film which gives him a good reason to relapse into his faults which are visible in the second film rank a the third film in the original pentalogy was very well constructed in preparing the viewer for its sequel escape from the planet of the apes was a very interesting film in terms of how humans treated cornelius and zira positively although my favourite character in this film is dr otto hasslein who quickly understood the risk posed by the arrival of these chimpanzees in their world despite their pacifism it is interesting to note the dichotomy between dr hasslein who understands the risk and the other members of the commission as well as his audience who see little beyond the peaceful nature of cornelius and zira although he is portrayed as an antagonist i think his decision to prevent the downfall of humanity at all costs is commendable only cornelius and ziras escape created a point of no return triggering the need for their deaths let us now move on to the second film in the reboot trilogy it ranks in the a category because it focuses heavily on the diplomatic difficulties of creating peace when it comes to restoring an entire people struggling for survival the film is very comprehensive in its treatment of this fragile diplomacy and it was fascinating to observe the difficulties encountered by humans because of koba who put obstacles in their way unfortunately this is understandable given what he suffered at the hands of humans having never had any positive contact with them thanks tom felton youre responsible for this mess i think this reboot series could very well have ended after this second film and that the ending everyone in their own corner for a shared planet without violence was enough on its own to explain how we got to the planet of the apes presented in the first film of the original pentalogy in the chronological timeline the reboot series takes place after taylor is sent into space and ends before he returns to earth rank b i wont dwell on the first film in the reboot series as its a prequel explaining how the planet of the apes came into being lets just say that its a beautiful story and an interesting development for caesar who after seeing the good side of humanity in the person of will rodman thank you james franco discovers the bad side of humanity in the person of dodge landon a nice nod to the characters of dodge and landon from the first film in 1968 caesars evolution is the most psychological aspect of the script and therefore the most interesting in my eyes which prevents the film from falling into the c category as for the second and final film in this b category it is classified as such due to a lack of balance between its psychological and intellectual content and its boom boom gun fight action content indeed apart from the labour camps the character of the colonel played by woody harrelson and the little girl who gives caesar hope for a better future human generation there is not much other intelligent content and the rest is limited to action scenes i wont mention the comic relief provided by the new fearful and clumsy monkey which was completely unnecessary rank c we begin with the sequel to the climactic film of the original pentalogy which seems less ambitious due to a lack of budget for production sets makeup etc however the issues addressed are very interesting caesars difficulties in reconciling humanity and simianity is there a word for that moral rules being established in the early stages of a society of apes an ape shall not kill an ape and the violation of these moral rules by an ape himself ultimately causing the apes to become even more humanlike as the underused character of macdonald points out at the end despite these themes the film remains much less ambitious than its predecessor and it shows to the point that i couldnt rank it in either category a or b as for the second film in this ranking i placed it here somewhat by default because it is the least worst of the remaining films and it is simply beautiful and well made visually speaking i know i said i preferred the psychological aspect but i am not 100 focused on that overall i had a hard time finding the right position for these last three films so i would say that in terms of production its the least bad of the three however its not good at all and i was disappointed when i went to see it at the cinema its a film without any major psychological issues you just have to put your brain next to your popcorn to enjoy it they could have explored the development of caesars civilisation and his legacy a little more than we see eg falconry but no the director doesnt even try i had a glimmer of hope for the character of trevathan a human who seemed to have completely accepted his status as an outcast slave to the apes but no his character is not developed any further than that a disappointment in the making for a film that is absolutely unnecessary just like those in the d category below rank d i really dont want to talk about it like really tim burtons film is full of clichs with an antagonist monkey who is far too human for his time in his thirst for power the only thing i liked was the area called calima equivalent to the forbidden zone in the original pentalogy in the reboot the fact that this area is called calima because those are the words not covered by sand on the caution live animals sign showing that the space station crashed is the only slightly interesting element in the film now lets move out of the frying pan into the fire with the last movie of this tierlist beneath the planet of the apes is a truly awful film honestly the script is on a par with a television film not a cinema film apart from the monstrous amount of inconsistencies and incoherencies created among other things by the change in dr zaius personality who seems to no longer care about hiding the truth about his peoples origins as well as the fact that the film rushes through brents progression in this world in a desperate attempt not to create a clone of taylor the director attempts without much success to address the issue of nuclear risk and the nuclear threat in the midst of the cold war the idea gets across but the execution is disastrous with this story of science fiction mutants with telepathic powers that is anything but intelligent thoughtprovoking science fiction thankfully the fatalistic ending attempts to raise the bar but it is impossible to salvage such a rotten script sorry for the huge chunk of text but at least it has the advantage of being longer than the scripts for new kingdom the two from rank d all combined looking forward to hearing your opinions and tier lists on the subject",
    "current fleet going into iae looking for recommendation to wrap it up currently have the kraken in buyback used the credit to get the bis ships i didnt own to get the skins on account but otherwise this is what i currently have in my list of ships i want to hold on to shiv is still up in the air i mostly do fps and mining got a decent coverage on fighters and heavy combat to manage events and most pve content but its not my main focus when i play for fun and not just to farm events my main core here is the 600i315p to explore find cool stuff if valuable enough especially mining related use nautilus to lock it down with mines while i get the industry setup to process whatever i find main focus is space mining thus the orion cat and railen for space cargo to unload the orion and keep it running kraken combat ships for fire support if someone shows up to contest the operation the orion being the focus is why i dont really have any refining ship around it and salvage has never had a ship that really attracted my attention therefore the industrial loop feels solid enough right now but open to suggestions as a fps player as my second main focus i feel like im lacking in either dropships or vehicle delivery the cat could fill that role in the future but no clarity on how its elevators will end up working is leaving me uncomfortable to rely on that right now im considering a ironclad assault or liberator for iae i do not like the hercules series at all so the c2m2 are off in my book any recommendation on these 2 or others",
    "how i design software architecture hello reddit i wanted to share an educational deep dive into the programming workflow i developed for myself that finally allowed me to tackle huge complex features without introducing massive technical debt for context i used to struggle with tools like cursor and claude code they were great for small wellscoped iterations but as soon as the conceptual complexity and scope of a change grew my workflows started to break down it wasnt that the tools literally couldnt touch 1015 files it was that i was asking them to execute big fuzzy refactors without a clear staged plan like many people i went deep into the whole rules ecosystem cursor rules agentmd files skills mcps and all sorts of yamlmarkdowndriven configuration the disappointing realization was that most decisions werent actually driven by intelligence from the live codebase and largecontext reasoning but by a rigid set of rules i had written earlier over time i flipped this completely instead of forcing the models to follow an evergrowing list of brittle instructions i let the code lead the system infers intent and patterns from the actual repository and existing code becomes the real source of truth i eventually deleted most of those rule files and docs because they were going stale faster than i could maintain them instead of one giant doeverything prompt i keep the setup simple and transparent the core of the system is a small library of xml formatted prompts the prompts themselves are written with sections like identity role implementationplan and steps and they spell out exactly what the model should look at and how to shape the final output some of them are very simple like pathfinder which just returns a list of file paths or textimprovement and taskrefinement which return cleaned up descriptions as plain text others like implementationplan and implementationplanmerge define a strict xml schema for structured implementation plans so that every step file path and operation lands in the same place taken together they cover the stages of my planning pipeline from selecting folders and files to refining the task to producing and merging detailed implementation plans in the end there is no black box it is just a handful of explicit prompts and the xml or plain text they produce which i can read and understand at a glance not a swarm of opaque agents doing whoknowswhat behind the scenes my new approach revolves around the motto intelligencedriven development i stop focusing on rapid code completion and instead focus on rigorous architectural planning and governance i now reliably develop very sophisticated systems often getting to 95 correctness in almost one shot here is a stepbystep breakdown of my fivestage plancentric workflow my fivestage workflow for architectural rigor stage 1 crystallize the specification the biggest source of bugs is ambiguous requirements i start here to ensure the ai gets a crystalclear task definition 1 rapid capture i often use voice dictation because i found it is about 10x faster than typing out my initial thoughts i pipe the raw audio through a dedicated transcription specialist prompt so the output comes back as clean readable text rather than a messy stream of speech 2 contextual input if the requirements came from a meeting i even upload transcripts or recordings from places like microsoft teams i use advanced analysis to extract specification requirements decisions and action items from both the audio and visual content 3 task refinement this is crucial i use ai not just for grammar fixes but for task refinement a dedicated textimprovement taskrefinement pair of prompts rewrites my rough description for clarity and then explicitly looks for implied requirements edge cases and missing technical details this frontloaded analysis drastically reduces the chance of costly rework later one painful lesson from my earlier experiments outofdate documentation is actively harmful if you keep shoveling stale md files and handwritten rules into the prompt youre just teaching the model the wrong thing models like gpt5 and gemini 25 pro are extremely good at picking up subtle patterns directly from real code tiny needles in a huge haystack so instead of trying to encode all my design decisions into documents i rely on them to read the code and infer how the system actually behaves today stage 2 targeted context discovery once the specification is clear i strictly limit the code the model can see dumping an entire repository into a model has never even been on the table for me it wouldnt fit into the context window would be insanely expensive in tokens and would completely dilute the useful signal in practice ive always seen much better results from giving the model a small sharply focused slice of the codebase what actually provides that focused slice is not a single regex pass but a fourstage filefinderworkflow orchestrated by a workflow engine each stage builds on the previous one and is driven by a dedicated system prompt 1 root folder selection stage 1 of the workflow a rootfolderselection prompt sees a shallow directory tree up to two levels deep for the project and any configured external folders together with the task description the model acts like a smart router it picks only the root folders that are actually relevant and uses hierarchical intelligence if an entire subtree is relevant it picks the parent folder and if only parts are relevant it picks just those subdirectories the result is a curated set of root directories that dramatically narrows the search space before any file content is read 2 patternbased file discovery stage 2 for each selected root processed in parallel with a small concurrency limit a regexfilefilter prompt gets a directory tree scoped to that root and the task description instead of one big regex it generates pattern groups where each group has a pathpattern contentpattern and negativepathpattern within a group path and content must both match between groups results are ored together the engine then walks the filesystem gitaware respecting gitignore applies these patterns skips binaries validates utf8 ratelimits io and returns a list of locally filtered files that look promising for this task 3 aipowered relevance assessment stage 3 the next stage reads the actual contents of all patternmatched files and passes them in chunks to a filerelevanceassessment prompt chunking is based on real file sizes and model context windows each chunk uses only about 60 of the models input window so there is room for instructions and task context oversized files get their own chunks the model then performs deep semantic analysis to decide which files are truly relevant to the task all suggested paths are validated against the filesystem and normalized the result is an aifiltered deduplicated set of files that are relevant in practice not just by pattern 4 extended discovery stage 4 finally an extendedpathfinder stage looks for any critical files that might still be missing it takes the aifiltered files as previously identified files plus a scoped directory tree and the file contents and asks the model questions like what other files are critically important for this task given these ones this is where it finds test files local configuration files related utilities and other helpers that hang off the alreadyidentified files all new paths are validated and normalized then combined with the earlier list avoiding duplicates this stage is conservative by design it only adds files when there is a strong reason across these four stages the workflowstate carries intermediate data selected root directories locally filtered files aifiltered files so each step has the right context the result is a final list of maybe 515 files that are actually important for the task out of thousands of candidates selected based on project structure real contents and semantic relevance not just hardcoded rules stage 3 multimodel architectural planning this is where the magic happens and technical debt is prevented this stage is powered by a heavyduty implementationplan architect prompt that only plans it never writes code directly its entire job is to look at the selected files understand the existing architecture consider multiple ways forward and then emit a structured machineusable plan i do not trust one single model output i seek consensus from multiple experts 1 multiple perspectives i leverage a multimodel planning engine to generate implementation plans simultaneously from several leading models like gpt5 and gemini 25 pro the implementationplan prompt forces each model into an explicit metaplanning protocol they must explore 23 different architectural approaches list risks and reason about how well each option fits the existing patterns 2 architectural exploration because my custom system prompt mandates it each model must consider 23 different architectural approaches for the task eg a service layer approach vs an apifirst approach and identify the highestrisk aspects and mitigation strategies while doing that they lean heavily on the code snippets i selected in stage 2 models like gpt5 and gemini 25 pro are particularly good at noticing subtle patterns and invariants in those small slices of code this lets me see different valid approaches in standardized format 3 synthesis i then evaluate and rate the plans based on their architectural appropriateness for my codebase synthesizing them into a single superior implementation blueprint when i generate multiple independent plans a separate implementationplanmerge prompt acts as a chief architect that merges them into one coherent strategy while preserving the best ideas from each this ensemble approach acts as an automated robustness check reducing susceptibility to singlemodel hallucination or failure stage 4 humanintheloop governance this is the point where i stop generating new ideas and start choosing between them instead of one final plan i usually ask the system for several competing implementation plans under the hood each plan is just xml with the same standardized schema same sections same structure same kind of filelevel steps the ui then renders them as separate plans that i can flip through with simple arrows at the bottom of the screen because every plan follows the same format my brain doesnt have to reorient every time i can 1 flip between plans quickly i move back and forth between plan 1 plan 2 plan 3 with arrow keys and the layout stays identical only the ideas change 2 compare likeforlike i end up reading the same parts of each plan the highlevel summary the filebyfile steps the risky bits in the same positions that makes it very easy to spot where the approaches differ which one touches fewer files which one simplifies the data flow which one carries less migration risk 3 focus on architecture not formatting because the xml is standardized the ui can highlight just the important bits for me i dont waste time parsing formatting or wording i can stay in architect mode and think purely about tradeoffs 4 mix and tweak if plan 2 has a better data model but plan 3 has a cleaner integration path i can adjust the steps directly or mentally merge them into a final variant while i am reviewing there is also a small floating merge instructions window attached to the plans as i go through each candidate plan i can type short notes like prefer this data model keep pagination from plan 1 avoid touching auth here or plan 3s migration steps are safer that floating panel becomes my running commentary about what i actually want at the end i trigger a final merge step it feeds the xml content of all the plans i marked as valid plus my merge instructions into a dedicated implementationplanmerge architect prompt that merge step rates the individual plans understands where they agree and disagree and often combines parts of multiple plans into a single more precise and more complete blueprint the result is a final consolidated plan that actually reflects the best pieces of everything i have seen not just the opinion of a single model in a single run only after that do i move on to execution stage 5 secure execution only after the validated merged plan is approved does the implementation occur i keep the execution as close as possible to the planning context by running everything through an integrated terminal that lives in the same ui as the plans that way i do not have to juggle windows or copy things around the plan is on one side the terminal is right there next to it 1 oneclick prompts and plans the terminal has a small toolbar of customizable frequently used prompts that i can insert with a single click i can also paste the merged implementation plan into the prompt area with one click so the full context goes straight into the terminal without manual copypaste 2 bound execution from there i use whatever coding agent or cli i prefer like claude code or similar but always with the merged plan and my standard instructions as the backbone the terminal becomes the bridge that assigns the planning layer to the actual execution layer 3 history in one place all commands and responses stay in that same view tied mentally to the plan i just approved if something looks off i can scroll back compare with the plan and either adjust the instructions or go back a stage and refine the plan itself the important part is that the terminal is not magic it is just a very convenient way to keep planning and execution glued together the agent executes but the merged plan and my own judgment stay firmly in charge i found that this disciplined approach is what truly unlocks speed since the process is focused on correctness and architectural assurance the return on investment is massive one saved production incident pays for months of usage in summary i stopped letting the ai be the architect and started using it as a sophisticated multiperspective planning consultant by forcing it to debate architectural options and reviewing every file path before execution i maintain the clean architecture i need without drowning in an evergrowing pile of brittle rules and outofdate md documentation this workflow is like building a skyscraper i spend significant time on the blueprints stages 13 get multiple expert opinions and have the client me sign off on every detail phase 4 only then do i let the construction crew the coding agent start guaranteeing the final structure is sound and meets the specification",

    "off the grid part four part four my shivers slowly begin to fade away as i bask in the warmth of the fire my clothes are already beginning to dry and the numbness that had set in is leaving in throbs a whole new set of aches and pains replacing it i flex my fingers slowly as i hold my hands towards the fire seeking more warmth that damned wolf thats where this started i remember that much everything was fine right up until we made it to camp and i saw that wolf for the first time or maybe i just didnt notice all the strange things happening maybe i did notice them and that thing has muddied my mind so much i cant remember anymore dawn is still a few hours away i think i feel like im getting close to something important i just need to focus everything got so crazy after we found charlie or more accurately after charlie found us kellys hand on my shoulder nearly gives me a heart attack making me jump oh sorry i didnt mean to scare you kelly says in a quiet apologetic voice i just wanted to thank you for hanging out with me last night and helping me calm down after you mentioned seeing stephen and then him being gone it scared me but it also made me feel a little better about not being the only one who had something like that happen like maybe i wasnt going crazy and there really is something out here she paused for a moment a look of worry washing over her which then immediately made me scared again thinking something might actually be out here watching us trying to get to us when were alone she trailed off again before shaking her head and forcing a smile anyway just wanted to say thanks and that we havent seen any sign of where charlie went around camp were gonna hang out for a few hours to see if he shows up before doing a quick search around the area for him with that she wrapped her arm around my shoulders gave me a friendly hug and headed back to finish setting up her tent what was she talking about we didnt stay up last night did we i could have sworn we went straight back to bed after seeing stephen in his tent and what did she mean she had something similar happen out here i should have asked but she seemed really bothered by the whole thing already and i didnt want to make her panic if it turned out to be nothing that nagging haze starts to irritate the back of my mind again as i try to remember what happened i looked back out over the view to where i saw the wolf and it was gone as if it had never been there to begin with im not sure when but at some point that warmth faded as well a few hours before sunset we spread out and started to search within a small radius around camp for charlie we stayed within shouting distance of each other just to be safe he still hadnt shown back up yet and according to everyone else that was strange despite how forgetful he could be with trail markers he always made it a point to be here when they were expected to arrive they said it gave him the most time to show them all the stuff he discovered on his own that he loved feeling like the leader of their expeditions and usually he was a natural leader always calm and level headed he was patient and cautious when exploring new areas never letting his excitement over ride his common sense as the sun begins to set i hear them echo the call for us to return to camp and i echo it back i turn and head towards camp and a few minutes into my trip back i see lucy walking towards me not rushed or urgent just casual she gives me a sly smirk as she steps closer hey there ranger rick she teases flirtatiously finally got a minute alone with you ive been meaning to talk to you privately she purrs her voice dripping with seduction where is this coming from all of a sudden this is the woman who could barely stand to even look at me just a couple days ago lucy what are you doi she presses a finger to my lips to cut me off shhh shhh shhh she hushes me softly almost sweetly were having a moment here dont ruin it by talking now i know i havent exactly been nice to you so far but she trails off for a moment as she spins around and grinds her ass against my crotch hard enough that it almost hurts she lets out a sultry hum of excitement as she reaches her arms up and back her fingers gripping fistfuls of my hair as she leans back against me its just because you do thesethings to me i want to be faithful to kevin but when im around you so strong so capable i just get so wet she moans out as she grinds harder against my crotch i grunt and put some space between us taking a few steps back what the hell has gotten into you i ask offended and embarrassed first of all i dont have relations with my clients thats business 101 second youre with kevin a really nice guy and you two seem crazy about each other why would you jeopardize that for a stranger i ask quickly while taking a few more steps back putting as much distance between us as possible even as something compels me not to retreat not to pull away it isnt lust its some compulsion like needing to scratch an itch that only gets worse the more you resist the urge to scratch it she laughs low and sultry her eyes flicking over my shoulder before meeting mine again she holds up a finger to her lips and shushes me quietly before hiding behind a tree yo boy scout you alright over here stephen calls out startling me and drawing my attention i look over at him and then back to where i last saw lucy i see no signs that she was there not even a spot on the ground where her feet would have made impressions in the dirt and leaves i look back to stephen and he must be able to see the confusion and unsettled state im in he puts a hand on my shoulder halting my steps damn dude you look like youve seen a ghost or maybe ate some bad mushrooms he says with a chuckle when i dont respond right away he gets a bit more serious oh shit something really is bothering you come on lets get back to camp we can talk about it there dont need our expert going crazy on us he says trying for a joke that falls flat i give him a halfhearted nod and we head back to the camp by the time we get back i cant even remember the exact words lucy had used i remember what happened roughly what was said but everything else is hazy like it has a layer of static over it then i hear it a sound that i shouldnt be hearing yet a sound that pulls me from my daze and right back into reality about time you two culos lentos showed up lucy said loudly with a laugh she shouldnt be here yet i just saw her back in the forest stephen and i took a direct path back to camp we would have seen her run past us yet here she is sitting on kevins lap perfectly fine wwwhat are you doing here i stammer out even if she did get past us she would have had to run she would be sweaty out of breath not to mention it isnt smooth terrain running is next to impossible whats that supposed to mean lucy snaps back hopping off kevin wait shes wearing different clothes her outer vest is the same but the shirt she was wearing just a second ago was the one she was wearing yesterday i didnt even register it until seeing her now in the shirt she had been wearing all day she starts to say something again but i cut her off i just saw you what looked like you back in the forest we spoke touched and you disappeared right as stephen found me the same kind of thing happened last night i saw stephen walking around camp but when i checked his tent he was still asleep i let the words tumble out now already started might as well get it all out there hey man i was just kidding about the crazy thing you stephen begins to say before kelly cuts him off hes not crazy the same kind of thing happened to me she says quietly when i went to use the bathroom i saw something on my way back it looked like stephen sounded like stephen but it wasnt him when i looked into his eyes i felt a warmth spread through me something that i had never felt before when looking at him it was close to how it feels when i look at charlie but different more intense but distorted forced thats how i knew it wasnt really stephen that and he was saying all kinds of things stephen would never say told me how much he loves me how im the only woman in the world he has eyes for how im the reason he gets up every morning she says nervously a look of slight disgust on her face you have always been like a brother to me i look at you the same way i look at kevin plus youre the biggest manwhore i know ive lost count of how many times youve said youll never get married she says bluntly all eyes shift to stephen who looks just as shocked as the rest of us what i never did that i would never youre like a little sister to me but worse youre my friends sister his twin sister if i ever did anything with you i wouldnt be able to help but feel like im doing it with him too stephen explains in a rush but he seems sincere plus i couldnt do that to charlie he would never forgive me if i did anything like that kelly just nods her head i know you wouldnt thats what im saying i know it wasnt you but it looked and sounded exactly like you if i didnt know you so well i wouldnt have been able to tell it wasnt you kelly says frustrated but still holding an air of her softness something out here is able to look and sound like us i dont think anyone should be alone anymore not until we can figure out what is going on or at least find charlie maybe he knows something we dont she says clearly grasping at anything that might help make sense of all this were all silent for a moment before nodding in agreement just as we all start to move and get ready to settle in for the night we hear a noise from the forest something running fast the noise gets louder as we hear the footsteps charging closer i pull out my knife better than nothing and focus on the treeline stepping forward to intercept whatever is charging us we see the faint silhouette of someone charging and just as they burst from the trees into the light screaming and growling like a wild animal stephen tackles it to the ground charlie jesus christ man stephen yells a mix of panic and relief in his tone holy shit dude what happened to you stephen asks as he climbs off charlie charlie scrambles on the ground clawing at the dirt dragging himself to the fire and curling up beside it in the fetal position hes covered in dirt and scratches his clothes nearly torn completely to shreds he has a wild and crazed look in his wide bulging eyes fear and desperation highlight every feature of his face in the fire light the bags under his eyes hang down like a worn out shirt hinting at his lack of sleep eyes bloodshot and yellowed from ruptured blood vessels his wounds though are what really drew my attention some of the deeper cuts look almost like they have been tended to with a plant salve at a passing glance when i looked closer though i realized that wasnt the case roots twigs and budding branches began to sprout from his wounds his skin had become leathery and cracked almost resembling the bark of a tree stretched over a human skeleton he pants and wheezes and there is a flutter in his breaths like leaves rustling in the wind we soon find out why charlie begins to hyperventilate moving to his hands and knees and pushing stephen away roughly he chokes and sputters and i have to physically rub my eyes to make sure i am seeing correctly as he coughs a leaf shoots from his mouth followed by another then another until a flurry of blood and bile soaked leaves and twigs erupt from his mouth like an earthen volcano tears stream down his face as he claws at his throat reaching out to us to help him but all we can do is watch too stunned to move too shocked to react he thrashes and writhes

    "some thoughts after yesterdays blog post im slightly encouraged by yesterdays blog heres way too many thoughts about it definitely encouraged by this line from yesterday and the portal itself surrenders too much of destinys feeling of place and exploration so i spent a chunk of last night and my commute this morning thinking about some things that i hope wouldnt be huge lifts that would appeal to me personally some ideas are pretty blatantly stolen from other games like guild wars 2 the overarching idea is to encourage destination play and more social group play while deemphasizing activities that center around a timebased score which i feel discourages relaxing play and socialization im including bullet points specifically about eververse sales as well because business destination play encouraging casual destination play as a viable if slower part of the power climb add a destination score that is active while on a given destination this could be perdestination or just an overall score that persists when you switch maps patrols lost sectors public events roaming majors and destination events ie vex incursion etc contribute some amount to destination score at some score threshold reward powerful gear at 1 current power this would provide slow progress from relaxed social world play that encourages player interaction this has several benefits puts veteran players in shared spaces with new players this encourages both passive and active mentorship as new players are able to watch veterans complete events and some vets might even talk to people new players will see all the fancy gear veterans are using and want to earn it encourage more social play without strict time limits per activity players are more likely to take the time to use local chat or otherwise interact with each other friendly interactions encourage players to return to the game this also encourages eververse sales as destination play allows for a lot more build flexibility than endgame portal play which means players could be more comfortable using nonmeta exotics and thus more likely to buy ornaments for those exotics add a new tier to public events that require more coordination and provide better rewards legendary public events legendary public events could be added to existing publics as a new level above heroic players would first need to trigger the heroic event then complete another secret objective before completing the event to trigger the legendary event rewards something probably powerful gear at 1 faster public event rotation encourage public trains by increasing the frequency of public events events rotate through patrol bubbles in a destination on a fixed timer 10 mins such that a fireteam can continuously rotate through zones doing one public after another example edz 1200 pm trostland 1210pm outskirts 1220pm winding cove 1230pm firebase hades 1240pm the gulch 1250pm sunken isles 100pm the sludge 110pm trostland etc return seasonal publicstyle events as updated public events to increase variety take a look at the archive of seasonal events from earlier seasons where events took place in public zones ie season of arrivals and return some of them as regular repeatable public events destinationlike instanced play again looking to encourage socialization during downtime update more events to include social downtime between runs blind well is the best example here since it requires a manual trigger within the same arena between rounds with no kicktoorbit timer players have the opportunity to socialize while going through their loot or adjusting builds before triggering a new round this would work well with the returning derelict leviathan event or a returned escalation protocol or dark menagerie event but may also work with other announced 6player activities with some tweaking like destination play this downtime and relaxed time limit allows more player interaction which both encourages friendly socializationmentorship as well as allows players to show off all their eververse ornaments to players who might like to buy those ornaments returning events and rewards returning more largescale destinationlike activities would tickle nostalgia and provide more avenues for social play examples include escalation protocol which could be integrated into the map used for heist battlegrounds mars and updated to drop ikelios v3 weapons and gear from other warmindthemed seasons such as seventh seraph themed playlists this doesnt really help progression or anything i just think it would be cool to have some themed playlists for just hanging out with friends for example a hive playlist could include hive strikes coil savathuns spire etc if not playlists than just a category of activities could be cool for times when the fireteam just feels like jamming some themed activities tldr having all these instances timed scorebased activities is fine sometimes but its incredibly exhausting when it feels like the only way to progress at all or get new interesting gear encourage even slow progress in more of the social play spaces like destinations and 6player activities with fewer time limits would make progress feel less like a job im encouraged by the admission of error and the return of activities like the derelict leviathan public event and ketchcrash i still fear that there are too many fundamental flaws bad blood with players and tech debt for a real resurgence of the game without a clean break for destiny 3 but i think there are things that can be done that would make me personally feel more encouraged to log on and play as a relaxed social experience",
    "breaking the grass ceiling as a gen z professional beginning my career in the uk medical cannabis sector i expected a new industry that entered the market in 2018 to naturally reflect the modern workplace values of gender balance and representation that i grew up with yet after attending several industry events it quickly became clear that this was not the case the imbalance was striking and i wanted to understand why so few women were present one factor as i soon learned is that fewer women tend to apply for roles in industries perceived as high risk or uncertain this piece is both a call for more women to explore opportunities in this 205 million emerging sector and a reminder for businesses to act on the insights shared by luminos managing director ellen jardim on how to attract and retain more women in their organisations it also draws on the experience of heidi whitman founder of empowher cannabis society who demonstrates how building strong networks and visibility can empower women to lead and shape the industry from within why join the cannabis industry the medical cannabis industry is still young in the uk it has already proven successful in many countries around the world and is now finding its place here as it continues to evolve like any emerging sector it faces challenges including battling stigma driving clinical research encouraging investment ensuring affordability these challenges are complex and cannot be solved by a single voice in the uk we have the opportunity to shape the development of this industry from the very beginning for those who want to be part of something meaningful to help break down stigma and advance patient care now is the time to get involved speaking to luminos managing director ellen jardim to understand what this means both for women considering a career in cannabis and for businesses aiming to attract and retain diverse talent i spoke with luminos managing director ellen jardim whose expertise in recruitment sheds light on the challenges and opportunities ahead from your experience how do you see men and women approaching job applications differently in the cannabis industry any patterns that have surprised you in my experience women tend to apply only if they think they meet all of the requirements and preferences whereas men are more likely to apply if they like the role and feel confident they could learn on the job thats not to say that women are less ambitious or capable far from it it highlights the importance of writing gender neutral job descriptions and being clear about what is essential versus what is simply preferred when we make that clear it naturally attracts a wider and more balanced group of applicants what kinds of questions do female candidates tend to ask about workplace culture or career progression what do those questions tell us about how the industry is evolving ive noticed that many women ask more about flexible working patterns for example whether hours can accommodate childcare drop offs or if theres understanding around working from home when children are unwell often women are the ones working late into the evenings splitting their days working whilst children are in school and in bed the clients who offer flexible or hybrid working tend to attract more interest from candidates of all genders its also often more affordable for employers since candidates may not require travel expenses or higher salaries to offset commuting costs thinking back to when you first joined the sector what advice do you wish someone had given you what would you say now to women or underrepresented groups looking to build a career here the best advice i could give is to ask questions dont be afraid to speak up or to admit when you dont know something this is still a very new and evolving industry so no one is the absolute expert every interaction is an opportunity to learn and the people who stay curious tend to progress the fastest in this industry if you could give companies one simple actionable step they could take this month to make inclusion real not just a slogan what would it be meaningful progress often comes from small and thoughtful changes such as reviewing job descriptions for inclusivity ensuring meeting times accommodate different needs and offering flexible work arrangements rather than from broad statements or campaigns learning from elsewhere the united states shows what is possible when barriers are challenged early a decade ago only 12 percent of cannabis executives were women today women account for almost 40 percent of leadership positions in the us cannabis industry this includes both the recreational and medical markets that shift did not happen by accident it was the result of networks visibility and deliberate effort to explore how these lessons can inspire change here i spoke with heidi whitman founder of empowher cannabis society who has been at the forefront of empowering women in cannabis globally speaking with heidi whitman founder of empowher cannabis society what was the moment you knew the cannabis industry needed a platform like empowher what gap or opportunity were you responding to at the time entering the industry in 2015 i watched the us market evolve in real time while the uk remained years behind medical access didnt arrive until 2018 at that time i was working in cbd and attending every event financial meeting and board meeting i could what i saw was striking a sea of men in suits boardrooms full of male executives and me the only woman in the room often dismissed before i had finished my sentence i was told my passion for plant medicine whether over the counter or prescribed was unprofessional i was invited to present to boards and then promptly asked to leave it was quite simply a boys club i later learned the term women washing referring to women placed in companies merely as tokens and temporarily for business gains i knew that wasnt who i was and i refused to be reduced to that after exiting a cbd company i co founded in 2019 i started searching for women who would lift me up and in turn i began lifting others two incredible women hannah deacon and carly mayer stood beside me early on and helped me find my footing that solidarity inspired what became empowher cannabis society a global platform designed for connection credibility and collaboration co founded by myself and another woman professional rebecca allen tapp our purpose has always been to lift women meaningfully because when women are supported their businesses grow and the entire industry begins to reflect the diversity it desperately needs today empowher is headquartered in germany with a whatsapp community of over 870 women across 34 countries i am no longer alone i am surrounded by a sea of strong inclusive women who work confidently alongside men who share our vision of equality since you launched empowher how have you seen the conversation around women in cannabis change are there any turning points that stand out to you we are no longer on the sidelines were at the forefront the conversation has shifted from can women lead here to look what women are achieving empowher has given women a global home a network that feels both personal and powerful one defining moment came in berlin 2024 during the icbc event i called for a womens photo in the estrel lobby and women poured in from every corner of the conference we stood shoulder to shoulder entrepreneurs scientists lawyers advocates and something clicked the energy was electric that moment became a symbol of recognition respect and unity since then we have witnessed lasting partnerships friendships and business ventures born from that same spirit when a member posts a question in our community women from every region respond with advice resources and encouragement it has become a living ecosystem of expertise a force of women guiding each other through this industry together empowher connects women from different countries and backgrounds can you share an example of when that diversity sparked a collaboration or insight that might not have happened otherwise one of the most powerful aspects of empowher is how diversity drives opportunity our community includes women from south africa ghana macedonia and new caledonia regions often overlooked but full of potential through these connections we have helped women in new and developing markets build credibility access resources and form partnerships that transcend borders we have also helped change the face of industry events the days of all male panels are fading women are now moderating presenting and shaping the conversations that matter by bringing authentic regionally grounded perspectives to global stages we have proven that womens voices are not supplementary they are essential this diversity has not only broadened business opportunities but also reshaped how the industry understands leadership innovation and equity the cannabis sector can no longer be one dimensional we are making sure of that looking ahead what role do you think networks like empowher can play in shaping not just inclusion but the future direction of the cannabis industry itself i recently attended hemp for the future in iceland and for the first time i witnessed true equality balanced representation on stage and in the audience that moment reaffirmed that our work has real impact empowher has become more than a network it is a movement shaping the values and direction of the global cannabis industry the future we have envisioned where women are visible respected and leading is already taking shape we are building an industry that values credibility inclusivity and compassion and one where collaboration between women and men creates lasting change there is no going backward now the global community we have built ensures that no woman entering this space has to stand alone again the future is bright connected and deeply human exactly as we intended from the start spotlighting the women leading while the number of women in visible leadership roles in the uk medical cannabis sector remains small those who are here are paving important paths forward victoria lawrence managing director of bridge farms is leading one of the countrys most advanced horticultural projects morag thomas coo of waterside pharmaceuticals is helping bridge the uks medicinal cannabis supply gap heidi whitman founder of empowher has built a global network where women in cannabis can connect mentor and collaborate ellen jardim managing director of lumino is shaping the industry through recruitment and talent development these women prove there is a path forward but the industry needs more voices walking it the cannabis ecosystem spans research cultivation supply chains recruitment advocacy and patient engagement each area offers opportunities for new leaders to emerge and for diverse perspectives to influence the future of medical cannabis in the uk with domestic cultivation increasing and new stakeholders entering the space the uk stands at an important crossroads not only in terms of regulation and investment but in the kind of culture it chooses to build we have a chance to create an industry that future generations will be proud of one that is credible compassionate and inclusive but that will only happen if we start now by breaking down the grass ceiling together written by anastacia peters with thanks to heidi whitman ellen jardim",

    "why i built an opensource front end for the gemini api to take back control from rising llm subscriptions on pax historia ive been watching the pricing structures for several llms like polaris deepseek etc services shift from reasonable to exclusionary for hobbyists and developers the moment they put the most essential tools behind a steep paywall i realized the real problem wasnt the cost but the lack of control so i spent the last 79 hours building pax like game called grand strategy ai version beta its a simple powerful and completely open source client that uses your personal gemini api key to run game my goal was to create a framework that gives the my pax bros and girlies direct access to the raw power of the underlying models without the restrictive overhead of a monthly subscription so heres why using your own key via a custom client is superior for power user 1 true usage based prices you get free requests over 6000 per day and you pay google directly for the tokens you consume for most hobbyists this keeps the cost to literal cents far below any fixed 20 month subscription required by closed source services guys im sharing the entire project the full front end code built in a single clean htmljs file and the api logic because i think we need more transparency and fewer gatekeepers in the ai space btw the core engine is now stable and the ai is successfully generating structured turn specific events now im looking for feedback and suggestions on the next major mechanical improvements i have an idea of adding moon and space warfare like u can explore our solar system build bases like that",

    "early game prayer has too little benefit for a new player to understand its value until midlevels is too annoying to replenish on the fly and is too focussed on combat i remember my early game prayer experience somewhat vividly id use the stat boosting prayers not actually see any serious difference and just be out of prayer power which id understand is bad so id get a negative feeling but also simultaneously not understand why i should care to begin with on top of that at early levels having to go back to a particular inworld location to actually recover prayer points period is such a chore nbsp additionally every single early level prayer does bupkis worth caring about for a new player theres nothing especially impactful or feelgood until the protection prayers starting from level 37 nbsp these are some of my ideas for making early and midgame prayers more interesting worthwhile and accessible while increasing overall variety and making prayer in general feel a tad more impactful and widereaching nbsp rapid heal early access improvements nbsp quite simply the impact of this prayer is not severe enough for it to take all the way to level 22 prayer to access especially since regeneration is automatically used for early game players postcombat to heal with adrenaline clarify that the prayer cannot regenerate health during combat in addition to its current passive boost make it improve the rate at which regeneration heals you postcombat not using the adren more efficiently just faster negate its prayer drain while the player is in a combat state and mention this in the tooltip make it automatically trigger regeneration postcombat for players that are far enough in the game to have unlocked adrenalinepausing mechanics as a means of reenabling lowerintensity play the end result of these is that rapid heal a level 1 prayer would say cost 10 per minute nbsp improves outofcombat passive health recovery and postcombat health regeneration speed by 2x entering combat halts this prayers point drain until combat ends nbsp one piercing note lift citharede robe prayer regen while resting to be a permanent account upgrade nbsp one piercing note is already an important quest for unlocking useful abilities for a low level player but the effect of citharede robes being tied to a piece of equipment makes them hardly ever used outside of trying them out for the first time on top of that right now the effect the robes grant is 33 prayer points per tick when resting at a musician which is both too slow and too limited nbsp to address the accessibility of prayer restoration for an exploring lowlevel player making the effect of that gear a permanent upgrade would go a long way especially if a lesser effect can be achieved by resting anywhere this would be described in the quest rewards as can now meditate while resting to slowly recover lost prayer points with improved results when resting by musicians while resting anywhere 5 prayer points recovered per tick 2 to prayer point recovery for every 11th level 11 prayer points per tick at level 33 23pts at 99 this isnt a lot but for a low level player just a few ticks of resting will be enough to get a few minutes of rapid heal while resting at a musician 66 prayer points recovered per tick 5 for every 11th level 111 prayer points per tick at level 99 nbsp new prayer type invocations nbsp the core conceit behind invocations is that theyre a type of prayer you get at very early levels and can very clearly and obviously see the benefits of them improving as your prayer level goes up and your total prayer capacity increases nbsp they are essentially a prayer that you have to concentrate on and the longer you maintain them the more potent their effects similar to incense sticks and indeed some invocations could share incense stick effects as an example of the very first invocation a new player could get access to level 1 invocation beginners boon the luck of the beginner is a phenomenon oftobserved nbsp nbsp cost 10pts per minute 10 chance to obtain additional resources from normal trees and coppertin rocks increasing by an additional 10 every 3 minutes up to a maximum of 40 effect stacks with guam incense sticks the above invocation like rapid heal helps to set clear expectations for exactly how beneficial it can be to have lots of prayer points an extra benefit would be drawing the new players attention to the existence of incense sticks making a thematic link between firemaking and prayer also could serve as an excuse to buff guam sticks slightly nbsp nbsp an additional crucial aspect of invocations is that if youre concentrating on combat or meditation via resting you cannot maintain an invocation causing them to turn off and reset this further reinforces the value of getting either a higher prayer level for access to more prayer points or getting access to new means of prayer restoration that dont break concentration like prayer potions prayer pigs the ancient elven ritual shard and notably prayer altars this also means that some locations would be naturally hostile to invocations due to aggressive enemies like the living rock caverns this could hypothetically be rectified with a new prayer call it something like deep focus that incurs an additional prayer point penalty for the benefit of keeping invocations running even if an enemy engages you in combat nbsp further invocations level 40 invocation gatherers grace nature can be generous just as it can be cruel nbsp nbsp cost 30pts per minute 2 chance for gathered items to be sent directly to the bank increasing by an additional 2 for every 5 minutes up to a maximum of 8 effect supersedes sign of the porter charges effect stacks with dwarf weed incense sticks notably for an ironman this one would be accessible considerably earlier than dwarf weed incense sticks would be requiring level 70 firemaking to craft nbsp level 20 invocation farmers felicity the virtue of patience is one farmers know well nbsp nbsp cost 20pts per minute 3 chance to harvest additional resources from playercultivated crops and trees and to not consume allotment seeds when planting increasing by an additional 3 for every 6 minutes up to a maximum of 15 you may notice that this one has a longer time period per stack and actually goes up to 5 stacks across 30 minutes the idea is that it reinforces the core of traditional farming as being slow and patient and also deincentivizes just waiting for the full effect before utilizing it due to how long it takes turn the

would give the lowest level effect to players that did not set it but for every player to add their own log not only would that player extend the campfires duration but they would optin to the full effect and in the case of added logs at a higher tier than the campfire upgrade it for all contributing players for every person that contributes the campfires effect would strengthen by one tier for noncontributing players up to the campfires current tier as a maximum nbsp nbsp a visual effect of god symbol particles would occasionally sprout up around the campfire the actual effect determined upon lighting the logs based on the last altar the player prayed at with particles occasionally being determined by other contributing players nbsp the shrine outside falador would give guthix

    "space exploration is the physical investigation of outer space by uncrewed robotic space probes and through human spaceflight while the observation of objects in space known as astronomy predates reliable recorded history it was the development of large and relatively efficient rockets during the midtwentieth century that allowed physical space exploration to become a reality common rationales for exploring space include advancing scientific research national prestige uniting different nations ensuring the future survival of humanity and developing military and strategic advantages against other countries the early era of space exploration was driven by a space race in which the soviet union and the united states vied to demonstrate their technological superiority landmarks of this era include the launch of the first humanmade object to orbit earth the soviet unions sputnik 1 on 4 october 1957 and the first moon landing by the american apollo 11 mission on 20 july 1969 the soviet space program achieved many of the first milestones including the first living being in orbit in 1957 the first human spaceflight yuri gagarin aboard vostok 1 in 1961 the first spacewalk by alexei leonov on 18 march 1965 the first automatic landing on another celestial body in 1966 and the launch of the first space station salyut 1 in 1971 in the 1970s focus shifted from oneoff flights to renewable hardware such as the space shuttle program and from competition to cooperation the foremost example being the international space station iss built between 1998 and 2011 the 2000s brought advancements in the national spaceexploration programs of china the european union japan and india the 2010s saw the rise of the private space industry in earnest with the development of private launch vehicles space capsules and satellite manufacturing in the 2020s the two primary global programs gaining traction are moonfocused the chineseled international lunar research station and the usled artemis program with its plan to build the lunar gateway and the artemis base camp each with a set of international partners history of exploration first telescopes the first telescope is said to have been invented in 1608 in the netherlands by an eyeglass maker named hans lippershey but their first recorded use in astronomy was by galileo galilei in 1609 in 1668 isaac newton built his own reflecting telescope the first fully functional telescope of this kind and a landmark for future developments due to its superior features over the previous galilean telescope a string of discoveries in the solar system and beyond followed then and in the next centuries the mountains of the moon the phases of venus the main satellites of jupiter and saturn the rings of saturn many comets the asteroids the new planets uranus and neptune and many more satellites the orbiting astronomical observatory 2 was the first space telescope launched 1968 but the launch of the hubble space telescope in 1990 set a milestone as of 1 december 2022 there were 5284 confirmed exoplanets discovered the milky way is estimated to contain 100400 billion stars and more than 100 billion planets there are at least 2 trillion galaxies in the observable universe hd1 is the most distant known object from earth reported as 334 billion lightyears away first outer space flights mw 18014 was a german v2 rocket test launch that took place on 20 june 1944 at the peenemnde army research center in peenemnde it was the first humanmade object to reach outer space attaining an apogee of 176 kilometers which is well above the krmn line it was a vertical test launch although the rocket reached space it did not reach orbital velocity and therefore returned to earth in an impact becoming the first suborbital spaceflight in 1949 the bumperwac reached an altitude of 393 kilometres 244 mi becoming the first humanmade object to enter space according to nasa first object in orbit the first successful orbital launch was of the soviet uncrewed sputnik 1 satellite 1 mission on 4 october 1957 the satellite weighed about 83 kg 183 lb and is believed to have orbited earth at a height of about 250 km 160 mi it had two radio transmitters 20 and 40 mhz which emitted beeps that could be heard by radios around the globe analysis of the radio signals was used to gather information about the electron density of the ionosphere while temperature and pressure data were encoded in the duration of radio beeps the results indicated that the satellite was not punctured by a meteoroid sputnik 1 was launched by an r7 rocket it burned up upon reentry on 3 january 1958 first human outer space flight the first successful human spaceflight was vostok 1 east 1 carrying the 27yearold russian cosmonaut yuri gagarin on 12 april 1961 the spacecraft completed one orbit around the globe lasting about 1 hour and 48 minutes gagarins flight resonated around the world it was a demonstration of the advanced soviet space program and it opened an entirely new era in space exploration human spaceflight first astronomical body space explorations the first artificial object to reach another celestial body was luna 2 which reached the moon in 1959 the first soft landing on another celestial body was performed by luna 9 landing on the moon on 3 february 1966 luna 10 became the first artificial satellite of the moon entering in a lunar orbit on 3 april 1966 the first crewed landing on another celestial body was performed by apollo 11 on 20 july 1969 landing on the moon there have been a total of six spacecraft with humans landing on the moon starting from 1969 to the last human landing in 1972 the first interplanetary flyby was the 1961 venera 1 flyby of venus though the 1962 mariner 2 was the first flyby of venus to return data closest approach 34773 kilometers pioneer 6 was the first satellite to orbit the sun launched on 16 december 1965 the other planets were first flown by in 1965 for mars by mariner 4 1973 for jupiter by pioneer 10 1974 for mercury by mariner 10 1979 for saturn by pioneer 11 1986 for uranus by voyager 2 1989 for neptune by voyager 2 in 2015 the dwarf planets ceres and pluto were orbited by dawn and passed by new horizons respectively this accounts for flybys of each of the eight planets in the solar system the sun the moon and ceres and pluto two of the five recognized dwarf planets the first interplanetary surface mission to return at least limited surface data from another planet was the 1970 landing of venera 7 which returned data to earth for 23 minutes from venus in 1975 venera 9 was the first to return images from the surface of another planet returning images from venus in 1971 the mars 3 mission achieved the first soft landing on mars returning data for almost 20 seconds later much longer duration surface missions were achieved including over six years of mars surface operation by viking 1 from 1975 to 1982 and over two hours of transmission from the surface of venus by venera 13 in 1982 the longest ever soviet planetary surface mission venus and mars are the two planets outside of earth on which humans have conducted surface missions with uncrewed robotic spacecraft first space station salyut 1 was the first space station of any kind launched into low earth orbit by the soviet union on 19 april 1971 the international space station iss is currently the largest and oldest of the 2 current fully functional space stations inhabited continuously since the year 2000 the other tiangong space station built by china is now fully crewed and operational first interstellar space flight voyager 1 became the first humanmade object to leave the solar system into interstellar space on 25 august 2012 the probe passed the heliopause at 121 au to enter interstellar space farthest from earth the apollo 13 flight passed the far side of the moon at an altitude of 254 kilometers 158 miles 137 nautical miles above the lunar surface and 400171 km 248655 mi from earth marking the record for the farthest humans have ever traveled from earth in 1970 as of 9 february 2025 voyager 1 was at a distance of 1664 au 2489 billion km 1547 billion mi from earth it is the most distant humanmade object from earth targets of exploration starting in the mid20th century probes and then human missions were sent into earth orbit and then on to the moon also probes were sent throughout the known solar system and into solar orbit uncrewed spacecraft have been sent into orbit around saturn jupiter mars venus and mercury by the 21st century and the most distance active spacecraft voyager 1 and 2 traveled beyond 100 times the earthsun distance the instruments were enough though that it is thought they have left the suns heliosphere a sort of bubble of particles made in the galaxy by the suns solar wind the sun the sun is a major focus of space exploration being above the atmosphere in particular and earths magnetic field gives access to the solar wind and infrared and ultraviolet radiations that cannot reach earths surface the sun generates most space weather which can affect power generation and transmission systems on earth and interfere with and even damage satellites and space probes numerous spacecraft dedicated to observing the sun beginning with the apollo telescope mount have been launched and still others have had solar observation as a secondary objective parker solar probe launched in 2018 will approach the sun to within 19th the orbit of mercury mercury mercury remains the least explored of the terrestrial planets as of may 2013 the mariner 10 and messenger missions have been the only missions that have made close observations of mercury messenger entered orbit around mercury in march 2011 to further investigate the observations made by mariner 10 in 1975 munsell 2006b a third mission to mercury scheduled to arrive in 2025 bepicolombo is to include two probes bepicolombo is a joint mission between japan and the european space agency messenger and bepicolombo are intended to gather complementary data to help scientists understand many of the mysteries discovered by mariner 10s flybys flights to other planets within the solar system are accomplished at a cost in energy which is described by the net change in velocity of the spacecraft or deltav due to the relatively high deltav to reach mercury and its proximity to the sun it is difficult to explore and orbits around it are rather unstable venus venus was the first target of interplanetary flyby and lander missions and despite one of the most hostile surface environments in the solar system has had more landers sent to it nearly all from the soviet union than any other planet in the solar system the first flyby was the 1961 venera 1 though the 1962 mariner 2 was the first flyby to successfully return data mariner 2 has been followed by several other flybys by multiple space agencies often as part of missions using a venus flyby to provide a gravitational assist en route to other celestial bodies in 1967 venera 4 became the first probe to enter and directly examine the atmosphere of venus in 1970 venera 7 became the first successful lander to reach the surface of venus and by 1985 it had been followed by eight additional successful soviet venus landers which provided images and other direct surface data starting in 1975 with the soviet orbiter venera 9 some ten successful orbiter missions have been sent to venus including later missions which were able to map the surface of venus using radar to pierce the obscuring atmosphere earth space exploration has been used as a tool to understand earth as a celestial object orbital missions can provide data for earth that can be difficult or impossible to obtain from a purely groundbased point of reference for example the existence of the van allen radiation belts was unknown until their discovery by the united states first artificial satellite explorer 1 these belts contain radiation trapped by earths magnetic fields which currently renders construction of habitable space stations above 1000 km impractical following this early unexpected discovery a large number of earth observation satellites have been deployed specifically to explore earth from a spacebased perspective these satellites have significantly contributed to the understanding of a variety of earthbased phenomena for instance the hole in the ozone layer was found by an artificial satellite that was exploring earths atmosphere and satellites have allowed for the discovery of archeological sites or geological formations that were difficult or impossible to otherwise identify moon the moon was the first celestial body to be the object of space exploration it holds the distinctions of being the first remote celestial object to be flown by orbited and landed upon by spacecraft and the only remote celestial object ever to be visited by humans in 1959 the soviets obtained the first images of the far side of the moon never previously visible to humans the us exploration of the moon began with the ranger 4 impactor in 1962 starting in 1966 the soviets successfully deployed a number of landers to the moon which were able to obtain data directly from the moons surface just four months later surveyor 1 marked the debut of a successful series of us landers the soviet uncrewed missions culminated in the lunokhod program in the early 1970s which included the first uncrewed rovers and also successfully brought lunar soil samples to earth for study this marked the first and to date the only automated return of extraterrestrial soil samples to earth uncrewed exploration of the moon continues with various nations periodically deploying lunar orbiters chinas change 4 in 2019 and change 6 in 2024 achieved the worlds first landing and sample return on the far side of the moon indias chandrayaan3 in 2023 achieved the worlds first landing on the lunar south pole region crewed exploration of the moon began in 1968 with the apollo 8 mission that successfully orbited the moon the first time any extraterrestrial object was orbited by humans in 1969 the apollo 11 mission marked the first time humans set foot upon another world crewed exploration of the moon did not continue for long the apollo 17 mission in 1972 marked the sixth landing and the most recent human visit artemis ii is scheduled to complete a crewed flyby of the moon in 2025 and artemis iii will perform the first lunar landing since apollo 17 with it scheduled for launch no earlier than 2026 robotic missions are still pursued vigorously mars the exploration of mars has been an important part of the space exploration programs of the soviet union later russia the united states europe japan and india dozens of robotic spacecraft including orbiters landers and rovers have been launched toward mars since the 1960s these missions were aimed at gathering data about current conditions and answering questions about the history of mars the questions raised by the scientific community are expected to not only give a better appreciation of the red planet but also yield further insight into the past and possible future of earth the exploration of mars has come at a considerable financial cost with roughly twothirds of all spacecraft destined for mars failing before completing their missions with some failing before they even began such a high failure rate can be attributed to the complexity and large number of variables involved in an interplanetary journey and has led researchers to jokingly speak of the great galactic ghoul which subsists on a diet of mars probes this phenomenon is also informally known as the mars curse in contrast to overall high failure rates in the exploration of mars india has become the first country to achieve success of its maiden attempt indias mars orbiter mission mom is one of the least expensive interplanetary missions ever undertaken with an approximate total cost of 450 crore us73 million the first mission to mars by any arab country has been taken up by the united arab emirates called the emirates mars mission it was launched on 19 july 2020 and went into orbit around mars on 9 february 2021 the uncrewed exploratory probe was named hope probe and was sent to mars to study its atmosphere in detail phobos the russian space mission fobosgrunt which launched on 9 november 2011 experienced a failure leaving it stranded in low earth orbit it was to begin exploration of the phobos and martian circumterrestrial orbit and study whether the moons of mars or at least phobos could be a transshipment point for spaceships traveling to mars asteroids until the advent of space travel objects in the asteroid belt were merely pinpricks of light in even the largest telescopes their shapes and terrain remaining a mystery several asteroids have now been visited by probes the first of which was galileo which flew past two 951 gaspra in 1991 followed by 243 ida in 1993 both of these lay near enough to galileos planned trajectory to jupiter that they could be visited at acceptable cost the first landing on an asteroid was performed by the near shoemaker probe in 2000 following an orbital survey of the object 433 eros the dwarf planet ceres and the asteroid 4 vesta two of the three largest asteroids were visited by nasas dawn spacecraft launched in 2007 hayabusa was a robotic spacecraft developed by the japan aerospace exploration agency to return a sample of material from the small nearearth asteroid 25143 itokawa to earth for further analysis hayabusa was launched on 9 may 2003 and rendezvoused with itokawa in midseptember 2005 after arriving at itokawa hayabusa studied the asteroids shape spin topography color composition density and history in november 2005 it landed on the asteroid twice to collect samples the spacecraft returned to earth on 13 june 2010 jupiter the exploration of jupiter has consisted solely of a number of automated nasa spacecraft visiting the planet since 1973 a large majority of the missions have been flybys in which detailed observations are taken without the probe landing or entering orbit such as in pioneer and voyager programs the galileo and juno spacecraft are the only spacecraft to have entered the planets orbit as jupiter is believed to have only a relatively small rocky core and no real solid surface a landing mission is precluded reaching jupiter from earth requires a deltav of 92 kms which is comparable to the 97 kms deltav needed to reach low earth orbit fortunately gravity assists through planetary flybys can be used to reduce the energy required at launch to reach jupiter albeit at the cost of a significantly longer flight duration jupiter has 95 known moons many of which have relatively little known information about them saturn saturn has been explored only through uncrewed spacecraft launched by nasa including one mission cassinihuygens planned and executed in cooperation with other space agencies these missions consist of flybys in 1979 by pioneer 11 in 1980 by voyager 1 in 1982 by voyager 2 and an orbital mission by the cassini spacecraft which lasted from 2004 until 2017 saturn has at least 62 known moons although the exact number is debatable since saturns rings are made up of vast numbers of independently orbiting objects of varying sizes the largest of the moons is titan which holds the distinction of being the only moon in the solar system with an atmosphere denser and thicker than that of earth titan holds the distinction of being the only object in the outer sol",
