    "fox and other rightwing media are ignoring or praising the trump familys cryptocurrency corruption published 082825 1030 am edt written by sophie lawton research contributions from rob savillo pete tsipis alicia sadowski isabella corrao jane lee helena hind john knefel harrison ray sage hodil casey wexler tyler monroe president donald trump and his family are taking part in selfdealing cryptocurrency schemes and rightwing media are mostly fine with it the rampant conflicts of interest have been extensively reported on by mainstream news outlets including the biggest names in broadcast and print media yet fox news and other rightwing outlets have with notably few exceptions dismissed allegations of corruption and instead praised the trump familys crypto dealings key findings the new york times the wall street journal and the washington post have published a combined 40 frontpage stories about the trump familys crypto ventures from his inauguration through the end of july mainstream broadcast news programs abcs world news tonight cbss evening news nbcs nightly news pbs newshour aired at least 17 segments since the inauguration dedicated specifically to cryptorelated topics calling attention to the trump conflicts of interest fox news rarely commented on the trump familys alleged corruption and frequently praised or defended the familys business dealings the network has aired only three segments mentioning the trumps crypto business two of which were interviews with eric trump and donald trump jr rightleaning podcasters including joe rogan michael knowles and alex jones have defended donald trumps involvement in crypto investments newsmax has also strongly defended the trump family for its crypto dealings the review found only a few rightwing podcasters that have voiced any kind of objection to this profiteering including ben shapiro and farright podcasters stew peters and nick fuentes the trump familys cryptocurrency landscape in december 2022 donald trump licensed his name and image through a corporate subsidiary to launch 45000 trump digital trading cards priced at us 99 each sold out in less than 24 hours bringing in approximately us 45 million in january 2025 just a few days before his second inauguration trump launched his own meme coin trump which sold around us 350 million during its initial rollout the family also launched melania a matching meme coin for the first lady around the same time since then the securities and exchange commission under trump has closed or suspended investigations into at least 12 crypto firms including several that donated millions to groups backing trumps 2024 campaign or directly funded his 2025 inauguration in march trump signed an executive order establishing a strategic bitcoin reserve and a us digital asset stockpile as part of his promise to position america as the global leader in cryptocurrency the trump media and technology group reportedly acquired us 2 billion worth of bitcoin inflating the presidents personal stake in the company to over us 23 billion his sons eric trump and donald trump jr are heavily invested in crypto and run a publicly traded bitcoinmining firm called american bitcoin eric trump joined the board of advisers at crypto investment firm metaplanet in march donald trump jr headlined an event for crypto company nexo capital which paid us 45 million in regulatory fines two years earlier the president and his sons are also majority backers of world liberty financial a crypto venture that reportedly raised us 550 million via selling governance tokens they now claim 75 of net revenue from token sales and 60 from operations once the core business begins leaving the company itself with just 5 of the total funds raised so far in june reuters reported that the uaebased aqua 1 foundation purchased us 100 million worth of the companys tokens becoming the largest publicly known investor with the identities of nearly all milliondollar token buyers hidden behind anonymous digital wallets reuters estimated that the company had banked approximately us 500 million for the trump family at the recent token2049 conference in dubai eric trump revealed that world liberty financial was involved in a deal wherein the uae statebacked fund mgx will purchase us 2 billion of wlf tokens to invest in binance the worlds largest crypto exchange in 2023 the us settled an investigation into binance with a us 43 billion penalty and guilty plea from its founder for moneylaundering and sanctions violations two years later the case was dropped by trumps sec in the exercise of its discretion and as a policy matter after world libertys us 2 billion deal with mgx chineseborn crypto tycoon justin sun previously barred from entering the us until trumps sec froze fraud investigations against him reportedly invested us 75 million into world liberty financial sun also heavily invested millions in the presidents memecoin whose price jumped more than 30 after trump hosted a vip dinner for investors who paid over us 111 million combined beyond token launches and crypto ventures the president has relaxed regulations to favour crypto companies and eliminated the federal team investigating crypto crimes mainstream media coverage vs rightwing silence a study found that while mainstream outlets published multiple frontpage stories and broadcast segments rightwing media gave little attention to the alleged trump family crypto profiteering the wall street journal called one of the trump familys meme coins one of the starkest examples of the president benefiting from an industry his administration regulates the new york times reported the administration may represent a candidate for the most brazen use of government office in american history a washington post article noted that a dinner promotion created the specter of a paytoplay deal for wealthy investors seeking the presidents ear think again newsrewind",

for all this subreddit has undergone some big changes in this update first i became a new moderator for this subreddit via rredditrequest because the previous moderator ucookieclan4 sadly appears to have been suspended leaving the subreddit unmoderated by gaining access to this sub i plan on changing it to have it be all about the element uranium this means nothing about investing in stocks cryptocurrency politics it can be anything educational scientific historical collections suspected items that might contain uranium health and safety or even about detecting equipment such as geiger counters or scintillators itll be like one giant resource this subreddit will be anything and everything about the element uranium the only other subreddit like this has gone inactive and became restricted other subreddits would be specifically for glass glaze or minerals because there are so much more than just glass and minerals i want to share that uranium can be used for chemistry too or share that in the past there were radioactive quackery that utilized uranium ore and some probably have not even seen what uranium metal looks like i am hoping that by opening the topic to be all about the element uranium users would post some interesting things which may get others more interested in it as for additional moderator at this time because this community is still small i am not actively looking to add any additional moderators just yet in the unknown future as the community continues to grow i hope to invite some new moderators to join the mod team if i do add additional moderators i would probably announce it here first and then try to reach out to moderators of established subreddits specialized in a single topic of course it will be uranium related though having a moderator for different time zones would be nice so that this subreddit would have at least one moderator on at any given time now sadly i wont really be updating anything on old reddit and will mostly be leaving it as is so there will be no unique theme as this would take a lot of time some notable changes made to this subreddit would be the addition or changes to the rules report reasons removal reasons subreddit icon subreddit banner community theme user flairs post flairs emojis automations automod sidebar widgets wiki devvit apps rules have been updated the previous subreddit rules

new icon its simple but may be changed in the future if you have any ideas or suggestions please feel free to comment below here are some other potential icons that might be used potential icon 1 potential icon 2 potential icon 3 this subreddit was without a banner so a new one was made rather quickly by using a simple photo of some different colored uranium compounds with the subreddit name slapped on top of it the banner is subjected to change in the future like with the icon ideas and suggestions are appriciated new banner subreddit community appearance has been added a blue and green color scheme has been applied to give an impression of using a uv light to find uranium glass new post flairs have been added previously there were only a few selections of post flairs available because the topic of uranium is vast ive removed the old flairs and added in some new ones announcements buyingsellingtrading poll ama questions general discussion equipment uranium glass uranium glazed uranium minerals uranium compounds uranium metal uranium quackery norm tenorm thrifting antiquing rockhounding prospecting research development experimentations engineering uranium only the first two flairs are reserved for mods all other flairs are available for everyone all posts that were here before i stepped in as moderator will under go a flair change to reflect what is now available post flairs will be required when creating a new post new user flairs have been added user flairs has the same situation with post flairs ive removed the old one and added in some new user flairs and one is even editable too collaborator customizable glass collector ceramic collector rocks minerals collector element collector health physicist radiation safety officer nuclear worker radiation worker radiochemist nuclear chemist nuclear pharmacist nuclear pharmacy technician hazmat technician hazmat driver hazmat shipper moderators do not have a mod specific flair because at this time i feel that it is not required mods can simply distinguish themselves as one when needed a green text saying mod will appear next to a moderators name when distinguishing themselves in a post or comment the collaborator is the only user flair that cannot be self assigned it is reserved only for moderator to assign to members that have greatly contributed to the community additionally this flair will allow users to gain additional privileges via some of the installed devvit apps new emojis have been added various new emojis have been added in order to make the current post flairs and user flairs more unique to view some of the available emojis feel free select the editable user flair customizable and scroll theough some of the emojis the community guide has been turned on currently it only has a simple welcome message and a button to the wiki over time additionall buttons resources may be added as needed mod tools automations has been turned on a helpful text box will appear when users enter a specific keyword these are simply references or tips to aid in discussions at the moment there are no automations for posts an example of a specific keyword that will trigger said automations is mci a text box will appear hopefully to show the difference between millicurie mci and microcurie ci mod tools automoderator has been turned on automoderator will be used as an aid in moderating content while it can enforce some of the rules by removing specific content it can also let users know if a link is a possible disguised link or possible download file its not yet perfect but it can help keep this subreddit as a safe place upvoting downvoting comments all new comments will have their scores hidden for one hour afterwards comments scores will be visible to the public comments that have been deleted by the user or removed by a moderator will cause the comment tree to be collapsed users may have to expand the comments in order to view any undeleted comments crowd control filters has been turned on users with a negative community score will have their comments collapsed and their post be filtered out for manual review by a moderator in a way this is part of a users community reputation it is being utilized in a way to encourage users to follow the subreddit rules and to stay on topic additionally to keep this subreddit as a safe place free of toxicity the built in reddit harassment filter has been turned on content removed by this filter is marked and removed as potential harassment by reddits automated systems think of it like a reddit admin bot side bar widgets have been updated with the changes added to this subreddit being big some widgets have been turned on a filter by flair widget has been added so that any user can search for content within a specific category a text box has been added to provicde small notices and announcements if they are not being made as a post or through a devvit app the ruranium wiki has been made this is still in development no announcement post will be made for the completion of the wiki as new content is always being added to it for any updates please view the text box on the side bar as needed i wont be able to fit it all on here so heres a link to see whats going to be added old posts have been removed unfortunately some old posts will be removed to reflect the new set of rules in place some

    "fox news demanded that presidents know who they pardoned then trump said he didnt know the crypto tycoon he pardoned published 110625 written by jane lee isabella corrao research contributions from harrison ray rob savillo fox news has spent 1 hour and 23 minutes discussing bidens use of the autopen while airing only 3 minutes of coverage on trumps pardon of founder of binance trump claimed on 60 minutes that he knew nothing about the pardon in a highly anticipated interview on 60 minutes president donald trump claimed that he knew nothing about the pardon of changpeng zhao the founder of binance a cryptocurrency exchange with ties to his sons cryptocurrency venture world liberty financial trump also said that he didnt know who zhao was that he knew zhao got a fourmonth sentence or something like that and that he heard it was a biden witch hunt you might think that this story would be catnip for fox news which heavily attacked joe bidens use of the autopen to sign pardons in his final months in office accusing the former president of being unaware of who he pardoned some network personalities even argued that it was grounds to invalidate bidens pardons yet since october 22 through the morning of november 6 fox news has spent 1 hour and 23 minutes discussing bidens use of the autopen while airing only 3 minutes of coverage on zhaos pardon those 3 minutes of coverage entailed a brief bit on the networks comedy show gutfeld in which a network personality said that trumps remark was my favorite answer ever and a segment in which white house correspondent jacqui heinrich acknowledged that trumps remarks received attention because the president has argued joe bidens pardons should be void because he didnt know about them meanwhile fox contributor guy benson remarked on social media if we care about bidens autopen scandal on pardons and commutations we should shouldnt this answer from potus on this set of facts draw scrutiny and concern trump claimed he knows nothing about the binance ceo he pardoned binances founder and chief executive officer changpeng zhao pleaded guilty in 2023 to failing to maintain an effective antimoney laundering program thenacting us attorney tessa m gorman for the western district of washington said in a press release at the time that because changpeng zhao knowingly operated a financial platform without basic antimoney laundering safeguards the company caused illegal transactions between us users and users in sanctioned jurisdictions such as iran cuba syria and russianoccupied regions of ukraine transactions for which binance profited with significant fees as the new york times reported at the time treasury officials also said that binance had failed to institute programs to report suspicious transactions involving terrorist groups including hamas in the gaza strip al qaeda and isis department of justice 112123 the new york times 112123 after zhao became a key supporter of the trump familys world liberty financial cryptocurrency venture trump pardoned him discussing the pardon white house press secretary karoline leavitt said that the biden administrations war on crypto is over bloomberg has reported that binance is linked to the trump familys world liberty finance venture in multiple ways the wall street journal reported that around the time of the election zhaos representatives began discussions with allies of trump saying they wanted to find a solution to binances legal troubles in the us and offering a deal with a trump family business according to people familiar with the discussions once trump won binance formed a highlevel task force to strike a deal with the trumps nascent cryptocurrency venture world liberty financial that binance could leverage into clemency for zhao other people familiar with the matter said this spring binance took steps that catapulted the trump family ventures new stablecoin product enhancing its credibility and pushing its market capitalization up from 127 million to over 21 billion the wall street journal 102325 102925 bloomberg 11325 during the 60 minutes interview trump indicated he did not know much about why zhao was pardoned i dont know who he is trump told the program that well heres the thing i know nothing about it because im too busy and adding i know he got a fourmonth sentence or something like that and i heard it was a biden witch hunt trump also said i can only tell you this my sons are into it im glad they are because its probably a great industry crypto i think its good you know theyre running a business theyre not in government cbs news 11325 60 minutes reportedly cut trump being asked about the appearance of corruption with regards to the pardon axios reported that the extended video posted online removed a question from interviewer norah odonnell about the appearance of corruption axios also reported that the program did not include trumps reply i cant say because i cant say im not concerned i dont id rather not have you ask the question axios 11325 fox news has repeatedly accused biden of not knowing who he pardoned and suggested that such pardons would be invalid fox business anchor maria bartiromo on bidens pardons joe biden did not sign them but more importantly he did not know anything about them she asked who was controlling the autopen fox business mornings with maria bartiromo 31725 fox news contributor katie pavlich when it comes to signing of pardons the legality of that is now on the table in terms of questioning if the president didnt know why they were being signed and who they were for are they even valid fox news the story with martha maccallum 61125 fox friends cohost brian kilmeade questioned if biden knew about the pardons thats why we want to find out who was making the decisions and you have to wonder about the thousands of pardons at the last minute does he even know about it fox news fox friends 62625 article iii project founder and fox news guest mike davis the president needs to know who he is pardoning and president biden admitted that he didnt even know who he was pardoning fox news the ingraham angle 71425 fox news legal analyst gregg jarrett said biden recently admitted unwittingly that he did not approve each individual pardon he mentioned a white house aide reportedly testifying she had no idea who in bidens inner circle gave her permission to use the autopen it wasnt joe biden fox news hannity 71625 fox news host sean hannity it appears he didnt sign all the documents himself now oftentimes his team used an autopen instead it raises an obvious question how do we know that biden actually approved all the actions that his name was officially signed to the answer is we do not know fox news hannity 9525 fox news host greg gutfeld new emails revealed biden officials privately expressed concern that controversial pardons granted in the final months of his presidency and questioned if sleepy joe even knew about them sure sounds like it could be one of the great scandals of our time cohost jesse watters added biden said he knew their names he didnt know any of their names and even his people said he knew no ones names fox news the five 9825 on hannity sen ted cruz rtx said there are real questions whether joe biden had any awareness what he was doing had any awareness the criteria that were being laid out and whether he made the specific decisions and sean if he didnt make the specific decisions those individuals are not pardoned their sentences are not commuted fox news hannity 9825 fox friends cohost ainsley earhardt its illegal only the president is allowed to make these pardons and give approval for that if it turns out he doesnt know who he was pardoning and he didnt give permission that is not legal you cant have unelected people deciding who gets pardoned it has to be the president of the united states fox news fox friends 102925 fox news host will cain according to leaked emails allegedly between bidens top staffers biden didnt review some of these clemency decisions he elaborated sources told axios it was a mad dash to find groups of people that he could then pardon and then they didnt largely run it by the justice department to vet those commutations fox news the will cain show 103025 fox news has barely mentioned trumps admission about being unaware and has barely covered the binance pardon at all while still frequently discussing prior use of the autopen fox news contributor and radio host guy benson if we care about bidens autopen scandal on pardons and commutations we should shouldnt this answer from potus on this set of facts draw scrutiny and concern oversight shouldnt be selectively partisan and reflexively tribal by either side twitterx 11325 fox news has continued to cover the biden autopen investigation extensively after the pardon of zhao with the network dedicating at least 1 hour and 23 minutes of coverage to the scandal since october 22 fox news has barely mentioned trumps remark about being unaware and has barely covered the binance pardon at all with only 3 minutes of coverage discussing the pardon on the network on october 4 fox white house correspondent jacqui heinrich noted that the clip from 60 minutes got a lot of attention in part because the president has argued joe bidens pardons should be void because he didnt know about them fox news special report with bret baier 11425 the only other mention of trumps remark on air was from network personality tom shillue who said on the networks comedy show gutfeld that trumps remark was my favorite answer ever mediaite noted that the only other moment the instance came up was during a roll back of the views mockery on hannity trumps comments went unaddressed by guest lawrence jones who slammed the abc hosts commentary as slanderous mediaite 11425 methodology media matters searched transcripts in the snapstream video database for all original programming on fox news channel for any of the terms binance bytedance changpeng including misspellings zhao including misspellings usd1 crypto cz or world liberty financial from october 22 when president donald trump pardoned changpeng zhao through 10 am et on november 6 2025 we also searched transcripts in the snapstream video database for all original programming on fox news channel for

instances when either president donald trumps pardon of binance founder changpeng zhao or the accusations condemning former president joe bidens pardons for using an autopen was the stated topic of discussion or when we found significant discussion of either story we defined significant discussion as instances when two or more speakers in a multitopic segment discussed either story with one another we also timed mentions which we defined as instances when a single speaker in a segment about another topic mentioned either story without another speaker in the segment engaging with the comment and teasers which we defined as instances when the anchor or host promoted a segment about either story scheduled to air later in the broadcast we rounded all times to the nearest minute",
    "ruranium updates community reopened hello everyone ruranium is now open for all this subreddit has undergone some big changes in this update first i became a new moderator for this subreddit via rredditrequest because the previous moderator ucookieclan4 sadly appears to have been suspended leaving the subreddit unmoderated by gaining access to this sub i plan on changing it to have it be all about the element uranium this means nothing about investing in stocks cryptocurrency politics it can be anything educational scientific historical collections suspected items that might contain uranium health and safety or even about detecting equipment such as geiger counters or scintillators itll be like one giant resource this subreddit will be anything and everything about the element uranium the only other subreddit like this has gone inactive and became restricted other subreddits would be specifically for glass glaze or minerals because there are so much more than just glass and minerals i want to share that uranium can be used for chemistry too or share that in the past there were radioactive quackery that utilized uranium ore and some probably have not even seen what uranium metal looks like i am hoping that by opening the topic to be all about the element uranium users would post some interesting things which may get others more interested in it as for additional moderator at this time because this community is still small i am not actively looking to add any additional moderators just yet in the unknown future as the community continues to grow i hope to invite some new moderators to join the mod team if i do add additional moderators i would probably announce it here first and then try to reach out to moderators of established subreddits specialized

    "a cryptocurrency colloquially crypto is a digital currency designed to work through a computer network that is not reliant on any central authority such as a government or bank to uphold or maintain it however a type of cryptocurrency called a stablecoin may rely upon government action or legislation to require that a stable value be upheld and maintained individual coin ownership records are stored in a digital ledger or blockchain which is a computerized database that uses a consensus mechanism to secure transaction records control the creation of additional coins and verify the transfer of coin ownership the two most common consensus mechanisms are proof of work and proof of stake despite the name which has come to describe many of the fungible blockchain tokens that have been created cryptocurrencies are not considered to be currencies in the traditional sense and varying legal treatments have been applied to them in various jurisdictions including classification as commodities securities and currencies cryptocurrencies are generally viewed as a distinct asset class in practice the first cryptocurrency was bitcoin which was first released as opensource software in 2009 as of june 2023 there were more than 25000 other cryptocurrencies in the marketplace of which more than 40 had a market capitalization exceeding 1 billion as of april 2025 the cryptocurrency market capitalization was already estimated at 276 trillion history in 1983 american cryptographer david chaum conceived of a type of cryptographic electronic money called ecash later in 1995 he implemented it through digicash an early form of cryptographic electronic payments digicash required user software in order to withdraw notes from a bank and designate specific encrypted keys before they could be sent to a recipient this allowed the digital currency to be untraceable by a third party in 1996 the national security agency published a paper entitled how to make a mint the cryptography of anonymous electronic cash describing a cryptocurrency system the paper was first published in an mit mailing list october 1996 and later april 1997 in the american law review in 1998 wei dai described bmoney an anonymous distributed electronic cash system shortly thereafter nick szabo described bit gold like bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies that would follow it bit gold not to be confused with the later goldbased exchange bitgold was described as an electronic currency system that required users to complete a proof of work function with solutions being cryptographically put together and published in january 2009 bitcoin was created by pseudonymous developer satoshi nakamoto it used sha256 a cryptographic hash function in its proofofwork scheme in april 2011 namecoin was created as an attempt at forming a decentralized dns in october 2011 litecoin was released which used scrypt as its hash function instead of sha256 peercoin created in august 2012 used a hybrid of proofofwork and proofofstake cryptocurrency has undergone several periods of growth and retraction including several bubbles and market crashes such as in 2011 2013201415 20172018 and 20212023 in august 2014 the uk announced its treasury had commissioned a study of cryptocurrencies and what role if any they could play in the uk economy the study was also to report on whether regulation should be considered its final report was published in 2018 and it issued a consultation on cryptoassets and stablecoins in january 2021 in june 2021 el salvador became the first country to accept bitcoin as legal tender after the legislative assembly had voted 6222 to pass a bill submitted by president nayib bukele classifying the cryptocurrency as such in august 2021 cuba followed with resolution 215 to recognize and regulate cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin in september 2021 the government of china the single largest market for cryptocurrency declared all cryptocurrency transactions illegal this completed a crackdown on cryptocurrency that had previously banned the operation of intermediaries and miners within china in september 2022 the worlds second largest cryptocurrency at that time ethereum transitioned its consensus mechanism from proofofwork pow to proofofstake pos in an upgrade process known as the merge according to the ethereum founder the upgrade would cut both ethereums energy use and carbondioxide emissions by 999 on 11 november 2022 ftx trading ltd a cryptocurrency exchange which also operated a crypto hedge fund and had been valued at 18 billion filed for bankruptcy the financial impact of the collapse extended beyond the immediate ftx customer base as reported while at a reuters conference financial industry executives said that regulators must step in to protect crypto investors technology analyst avivah litan commented on the cryptocurrency ecosystem that everythingneeds to improve dramatically in terms of user experience controls safety customer service formal definition according to jan lansky a cryptocurrency is a system that meets six conditions the system does not require a central authority its state is maintained through distributed consensus the system keeps an overview of cryptocurrency units and their ownership the system defines whether new cryptocurrency units can be created if new cryptocurrency units can be created the system defines the circumstances of their origin and how to determine the ownership of these new units ownership of cryptocurrency units can be proved exclusively cryptographically the system allows transactions to be performed in which ownership of the cryptographic units is changed a transaction statement can only be issued by an entity proving the current ownership of these units if two different instructions for changing the ownership of the same cryptographic units are simultaneously entered the system performs at most one of them in march 2018 the word cryptocurrency was added to the merriamwebster dictionary altcoins after the early innovation of bitcoin in 2008 and the early network effect gained by bitcoin tokens cryptocurrencies and other digital assets that were not bitcoin became collectively known during the 2010s as alternative cryptocurrencies or altcoins sometimes the term alt coins was used or disparagingly shitcoins paul vigna of the wall street journal described altcoins in 2020 as alternative versions of bitcoin given its role as the model protocol for cryptocurrency designers a polytechnic university of catalonia thesis in 2021 used a broader description including not only alternative versions of bitcoin but every cryptocurrency other than bitcoin as of early 2020 there were more than 5000 cryptocurrencies altcoins often have underlying differences when compared to bitcoin for example litecoin aims to process a block every 25 minutes rather than bitcoins 10 minutes which allows litecoin to confirm transactions faster than bitcoin another example is ethereum which has smart contract functionality that allows decentralized applications to be run on its blockchain ethereum was the most used blockchain in 2020 according to bloomberg news in 2016 it had the largest following of any altcoin according to the new york times significant market price rallies across multiple altcoin markets are often referred to as an altseason stablecoins stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable level of purchasing power notably these designs are not foolproof as a number of stablecoins have crashed or lost their peg for example on 11 may 2022 terras stablecoin ust fell from 1 to 26 cents the subsequent failure of terraform labs resulted in the loss of nearly 40b invested in the terra and luna coins in september 2022 south korean prosecutors requested the issuance of an interpol red notice against the companys founder do kwon in hong kong the expected regulatory framework for stablecoins in 202324 is being shaped and includes a few considerations memecoins memecoins are a category of cryptocurrencies that originated from internet memes or jokes the most notable example is dogecoin a memecoin featuring the shiba inu dog from the doge meme memecoins are known for extreme volatility for example the recordhigh value for a dogecoin was 73 cents but that had plunged to 13 cents by mid2024 scams are prolific among memecoins physical crypto physical cryptocurrency coins have been made as promotional items and some have become collectibles some of these have a private key embedded in them to access crypto worth a few dollars there have also been attempts to issue bitcoin bank notes the term physical bitcoin is used in the finance industry when investment funds that hold crypto purchased from crypto exchanges put their crypto holdings in a specialised bank called a custodian these physical representations of cryptocurrency do not hold any value by themselves these are only utilized for collectable purposes for example the first incarnation of the bitcoin casascius coins made of silver brass or aluminum sometimes with gold plating or titan bitcoin which in silver or gold versions are sought after by numismatists architecture cryptocurrency is produced by an entire cryptocurrency system collectively at a rate that is defined when the system is created and that is publicly stated in centralized banking and economic systems such as the us federal reserve system corporate boards or governments control the supply of currency in the case of cryptocurrency companies or governments cannot produce new units and have not so far provided backing for other firms banks or corporate entities that hold asset value measured in it the underlying technical system upon which cryptocurrencies are based was created by satoshi nakamoto within a proofofwork system such as bitcoin the safety integrity and balance of ledgers are maintained by a community of mutually distrustful parties referred to as miners miners use their computers to help validate and timestamp transactions adding them to the ledger in accordance with a particular timestamping scheme in a proofofstake blockchain transactions are validated by holders of the associated cryptocurrency sometimes grouped together in stake pools most cryptocurrencies are designed to gradually decrease the production of that currency placing a cap on the total amount of that currency that will ever be in circulation compared with ordinary currencies held by financial institutions or kept as cash on hand cryptocurrencies can be more difficult for seizure by law enforcement blockchain the validity of each cryptocurrencys coins is provided by a blockchain a blockchain is a continuously growing list of records called blocks which are linked and secured using cryptography each block typically contains a hash pointer as a link to a previous block a timestamp and transaction data by design blockchains are inherently resistant to modification of the data a blockchain is an open distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way for use as a distributed ledger a blockchain is typically managed by a peertopeer network collectively adhering to a protocol for validating new blocks once recorded the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all subsequent blocks which requires collusion of the network majority blockchains are secure by design and are an example of a distributed computing system with high byzantine fault tolerance decentralized consensus has therefore been achieved with a blockchain nodes a node is a computer that connects to a cryptocurrency network the node supports the cryptocurrencys network through either relaying transactions validation or hosting a copy of the blockchain in terms of relaying transactions each network computer node has a copy of the blockchain of the cryptocurrency it supports when a transaction is made the node creating the transaction broadcasts details of the transaction using encryption to other nodes throughout the node network so that the transaction and every other transaction is known node owners are either volunteers those hosted by the organization or body responsible for developing the cryptocurrency blockchain network technology or those who are enticed to host a node to receive rewards from hosting the node network timestamping cryptocurrencies use various timestamping schemes to prove the validity of transactions added to the blockchain ledger without the need for a trusted third party the first timestamping scheme invented was the proofofwork scheme the most widely used proofofwork schemes are based on sha256 and scrypt some other hashing algorithms that are used for proofofwork include cryptonote blake sha3 and x11 another method is called the proofofstake scheme proofofstake is a method of securing a cryptocurrency network and achieving distributed consensus through requesting users to show ownership of a certain amount of currency it is different from proofofwork systems that run difficult hashing algorithms to validate electronic transactions the scheme is largely dependent on the coin and there is currently no standard form of it some cryptocurrencies use a combined proofofwork and proofofstake scheme mining on a blockchain mining is the validation of transactions for this effort successful miners obtain new cryptocurrency as a reward the reward decreases transaction fees by creating a complementary incentive to contribute to the processing power of the network the rate of generating hashes which validate any transaction has been increased by the use of specialized hardware such as fpgas and asics running complex hashing algorithms like sha256 and scrypt this arms race for cheaperyetefficient machines has existed since bitcoin was introduced in 2009 mining is measured by hash rate typically in ths a 2023 imf working paper found that crypto mining could generate 450 million tons of co2 emissions by 2027 accounting for 07 percent of global emissions or 12 percent of the world total with more people entering the world of virtual currency generating hashes for validation has become more complex over time forcing miners to invest increasingly large sums of money to improve computing performance consequently the reward for finding a hash has diminished and often does not justify the investment in equipment and cooling facilities to mitigate the heat the equipment produces and the electricity required to run them popular regions for mining include those with inexpensive electricity a cold climate and jurisdictions with clear and conducive regulations by july 2019 bitcoins electricity consumption was estimated to be approximately 7 gigawatts around 02 of the global total or equivalent to the energy consumed nationally by switzerland some miners pool resources sharing their processing power over a network to split the reward equally according to the amount of work they contributed to the probability of finding a block a share is awarded to members of the mining pool who present a valid partial proofofwork as of february 2018 the chinese government has halted trading of virtual currency banned initial coin offerings and shut down mining many chinese miners have since relocated to canada and texas one company is operating data centers for mining operations at canadian oil and gas field sites due to low gas prices in june 2018 hydro quebec proposed to the provincial government to allocate 500 megawatts of power to crypto companies for mining according to a february 2018 report from fortune iceland has become a haven for cryptocurrency miners in part because of its cheap electricity in march 2018 the city of plattsburgh new york put an 18month moratorium on all cryptocurrency mining in an effort to preserve natural resources and the character and direction of the city in 2021 kazakhstan became the secondbiggest cryptocurrency mining country producing 181 of the global exahash rate the country built a compound containing 50000 computers near ekibastuz gpu price rise an increase in cryptocurrency mining increased the demand for graphics cards gpu in 2017 the computing power of gpus makes them wellsuited to generating hashes popular favorites of cryptocurrency miners such as nvidias gtx 1060 and gtx 1070 graphics cards as well as amds rx 570 and rx 580 gpus doubled or tripled in price or were out of stock a gtx 1070 ti which was released at a price of 450 sold for as much as 1100 another popular card the gtx 1060 6 gb model was released at an msrp of 250 and sold for almost 500 rx 570 and rx 580 cards from amd were out of stock for almost a year miners regularly buy up the entire stock of new gpus as soon as they are available nvidia has asked retailers to do what they can when it comes to selling gpus to gamers instead of miners boris bhles pr manager for nvidia in the german region said gamers come first for nvidia mining accelerator chips numerous companies developed dedicated cryptomining accelerator chips capable of priceperformance far higher than that of cpu or gpu mining at one point intel marketed its own brand of crypto accelerator chip named blockscale wallets a cryptocurrency wallet is a means of storing the public and private keys address or seed which can be used to receive or spend the cryptocurrency with the private key it is possible to write in the public ledger effectively spending the associated cryptocurrency with the public key it is possible for others to send currency to the wallet there exist multiple methods of storing keys or seed in a wallet these methods range from using paper wallets which are public private or seed keys written on paper to using hardware wallets which are hardware to store your wallet information to a digital wallet which is a computer with software hosting your wallet information to hosting your wallet using an exchange where cryptocurrency is traded or by storing your wallet information on a digital medium such as plaintext anonymity bitcoin is pseudonymous rather than anonymous the cryptocurrency in a wallet is not tied to a person but rather to one or more specific keys or addresses thereby bitcoin owners are not immediately identifiable but all transactions are publicly available in the blockchain still cryptocurrency exchanges are often required by law to collect the personal information of their users some cryptocurrencies such as monero zerocoin zerocash and cryptonote implement additional measures to increase privacy such as by using zeroknowledge proofs a recent 2020 study presented different attacks on privacy in cryptocurrencies the attacks demonstrated how the anonymity techniques are not sufficient safeguards in order to improve privacy researchers suggested several different ideas including new cryptographic schemes and mechanisms for hiding the ip address of the source economics cryptocurrencies are used primarily outside banking and governmental institutions and are exchanged over the internet block rewards proofofwork cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin offer block rewards incentives for miners there has been an implicit belief that whether miners are paid by block rewards or transaction fees does not affect the security of the blockchain but a study suggests that this may not be the case under certain circumstances the rewards paid to miners increase the supply of the cryptocurrency by making sure that verifying",
