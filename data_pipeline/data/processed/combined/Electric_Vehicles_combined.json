    "upfront savings aside leasing might be the better deal for electric vehicles and plugin hybrid cars per consumer reports this is a fantastic indepth report on the pros and cons of leasing electric and hybrid vehicles by consumer reports senior autos reporter keith barry he also addresses if you should buy out your ev or hybrid car lease you can read that section here if you would rather skip the article should you buy your ev at the end of a lease that depends almost all lease contracts have whats called a buyout amount or payoff amount a dollar value that you can pay the leasing company to purchase the car outright you can negotiate this number but only before a lease is signed leasing companies hope that it will accurately reflect what a car is worth at the end of a lease but they could get it wrong if demand for used evs is high at the end of your lease resale values may be higher than expected and it may make sense to purchase the car for the buyout value thats written into the lease contract if the automaker underestimates the resale value you can buy the car and have equity or sell it for a profit says fisher thats what many lessees were able to do when usedcar values soared early during the pandemic but if similar cars are selling for less than the buyout amount written into your leaseor if the new crop of evs are better than the leased one youre turning inits smart to walk away",

    "not allowed go without an ev but flux rates arent competitive i recently got solar and a battery installed i dont yet have an ev or charger the solar generation is pretty poor at the moment and is likely to be until febmarch so i asked to move onto go in my area its 85p offpeak which would be great to fill the battery up when i tried to change tariff they told me i can confirm that the octopus go tariff is specifically designed for electric vehicles and cannot be used for another appliance they then pushed flux on me pretty hard but the rates are rubbish im currently on tracker 18pish and flux 165p is only 15p cheaper during off peak and is waaay more expensive at peak times why are they charging us so much more to charge a battery than an ev i thought ev batteries were way bigger i checked the tcs and it doesnt explicitly say you cant charge a home battery using it however i will admit it is all focused on evs has anyone successfully joined go and used it to charge a home battery only at off peak",

maximizing profit per hour which i think can be daunting for someone who isnt yet familiar with cayo so i wanted to write up a guide for an easy minimalstress run for newcomers preheist preparation recommended equipmentset up 1 armored vehicle armored kuruma is ideal here but any car with bulletresistant windows will work if you do not havecannot afford one the duke odeath is free to claim from warstock but its not the best in terms of bullet protection 2 flying vehicle if youre brand new to this run other jobs until you can afford the sparrow upgrade for the kosatka if you already have another flying vehicle it wont be as convenient but it will work 3 rebreathers go to ammunation and stock up on rebreathers 4 set spawn point to kosatka gather intel getting the velum when triggering gather intel youll be sent to paleto bay to steal a smuggler plane fast travel your kosatka nearest your destination then use your sparrow if you have it to fly to the marker or beach the kosatka and call in another vehicle do not use explosives just get close and shoot all the bad dudes theres no penalty for dying just get the job done get in the plane and fly it to the waypoint disguise youre automatically wearing a smugglers disguise which grants you access to the airstrip roam around freely nothing bad can happen to you beyond the airstrip however if youre caught youll be sent back to the airstrip you can be caught by visual sight or by making too much noise like with a vehicle engine dont worry well be avoiding this risk mostly secondary loot values refer to this later gold fills 75 of a loot bag for 330k value a full bag of gold will earn you 492k cocaine 1 group of cocaine fills 50 of your bag for 220k in value 440k for a full bag weed 1 group of weed fills 33 of your bag for 150k in value a full bag will earn you 450k cash 1 group of cash fills 25 of your bag for 90k in value a full bag will earn you 360k paintings each painting fills 50 of your bag value floats somewhere between 140k and 200k each secondary loot planning if you want to grab secondary loot youre going to scope 3 locations the hangar the air strip shed and rubios office which you will do when hacking the security cameras if you do not want to grab secondary loot you can still scope for loot in rubios office while hacking the security cameras and if there are paintings inside you can still come away with secondary loot without hardly any additional effort hangar loot start with the hangar go inside peer through the cage on the main level and photograph whatever is on the two tables park the fork lift near the cage and climb onto the roof to see the tables on the second level shed loot the shed is directly across the ramped road from the power station just run inside the shed and snap pics of the two tables rubios office as the main objective you will hack the security cameras to identify the primary target while doing this scan rubios office for paintings unless youve already found more valuable loot at the air strip once you know what loot is available at these 3 locations use the secondary loot value table to decide which loot stashes to hit if youre lucky the hangar will have a full bags worth of valuable loot otherwise youll need to also hit up the shed which only slightly complicates this run but its no big deal scope the primary you have to sneak across the island to the radio tower most guides are going to have to try to jump over a checkpoint with a motorcycle but ill tell you that in my experience its pretty easy to get caught and sent back to the airstrip without the bike yet ive had 100 success just ditching the bike before the checkpoint and running the rest of the way i believe until you get the hang of it its a safer bet to do it my way you can use this route but at the point where he jumps the checkpoint i would park the bike to the right side of the road and run through the gate immediately turning right and just using your minimap to dodge vision cones as you run to the tower at the tower the network panel could be on the ground level or up on the tower somewhere find it hack it and scan through the camera feeds if the loot at the air strip was disappointing find rubios office camera feed and look for paintings if the air strip loot was good just look for the basement camera and scope the primary target once youve scoped the primary exit out of the camera feeds pause the game go to online find new session and youll spawn in your kosatka with the objective completed you do not need to sneak back to the airplane nor do you need to get yourself caught or die to get teleported back skip all of that by starting a new session heist prep prep bearer bonds steal safe code if your primary target is bearer bonds youll be stealing safe codes from a dude at the casino the mission is completed the instant you lose the cops at which point you will switch sessions to teleport to your kosatka at this point fast travel your kosatka back to vespucci beach any other item steal plasma cutter if your primary target is something in the glass case you will need to return the item to your kosatka so before you launch this mission fast travel the kosatka back to vespucci beach if you own a flying vehicle you may leave your kosatka out in the water if you choose or beach it to save some time if you dont own a flying vehicle park your kosatka at the end of the pier and use the pier to drive to the top of the sub so you can jump on easily keep in mind that any vehicle you park on top of the sub may fall into the water so be sure to return it to storage before you enter the sub or beach the sub so that when it falls off it lands on the sand the sparrow parks inside the sub just fly over top and press right on the dpad to land automatically armor and snacks go to weapon loadout and buy the suppressors for 5000 you may not fire a shot but just in case you do its only 5000 for that added insurance skip approach vehicle prep save it for last this isnt super important but itll save you a little time heist prep actual steal safe code if you have this mission go to the casino run the halls until you find two guards standing outside a room quietly take them both down and go inside kill everyone find your target check his body for the safe codes then leave lose the cops mission over this is when you would switch sessions and then fast travel your kosatka back to the beach steal plasma cutter flying vehicle armored car makes this faster travel to first location there are no enemies here just go inside and look for the heist planning board and take a photo of it stand back a bit further than you think you need to before taking the photo go near your second waypoint if youre flying land and call in your armored car if youre driving proceed here all you need to do is drive over the objective item you do not need to exit the vehicle at all just bulldoze your way into the alleyway and collect the item then return to your flying vehicle and fly to your sub or just drive there steal blow torch travel to construction site look for hard hat usually near the entrance if your site is the skyscraper the hardhard is on the top level landing up there with a flying vehicle makes this super easy hard hat gives you a bit of a grace period of being seen before the alert is raised dont linger in vision cones just run around looking for the green marker above a tool box when you find the one that has the blow torch collect it then leave back to your sub steal fingerprint cloner travel to waypoint 1 pavel will warn you about the cameras ignore him it only gives you like a 2 second advantage go inside take cover shoot the 4 guards hack the computer travel to location 2 shoot both cameras by the door go inside run to the back and grab the cloner no enemies in here so breath easy return to sub steal weapons doesnt matter what guns you pick but i pick the loadout with sticky bombs to make it easier to suicide in case i need to restart if you get the merryweather mission either use your guided torpedo to blow up the helicopter at the destination to fail the mission or switch sessions to reroll the mission you want one that tells you to go to a building land on the roof if you can go inside kill everyone inside hack the computer and open the safe if you have a molotov throw it into the office and wait itll clear out most enemies leaving only a few when you go back to the elevator press left on the dpad to return to the roof shoot the gunners out of the helicopters then take off in yours if you approach from the ground you just have more dudes to fight take the guns back to the sub steal the longfin this will be your approach vehicle for the heist either call in your owned phantom wedge or steal one of the trucks pavel marks for you simply back up into the trailer then drive away drive a good distance away then exit the truck find another vehicle and lose the cops alternatively just suicide and when you respawn youll have no wanted level return to the truck and take it to the drop off now change sessions to teleport back to the kosatka this isnt necessary but it saves some time now youre ready to heist heist set up 1 approach vehicle longfin 2 infiltration point main dock important even though we arent going here 3 compound access drainage tunnel 4 escape point air strip or anything doesnt matter 5 time of day day 6 ignore 7 ignore 8 ignore heist 1 it begins with a cut scene of you driving the boat toward the docks hold the brake and hold the handbrake as soon as you can control turn hard left and drive the boat to the corner between the airstrip runway and the electrical station park near the shore but dont beach it you can turn it around now or wait until you return 2 run to the hangar avoiding the guard that patrols it collect whatever loot you decided to take from here using the fork lift to raise a crate so you can jump the fence if you need to go up there if you have all the loot you need from here skip step 3 3 skip this step if you already filled your loot bag otherwise go to the side road between the power station and the shed the guard patroling this road can be killed when hes walking away toward the open field take him out to remove the risk of him spotting you shoot the camera after hes dead inside the power station you can shut down all cameras if you wish but its not necessary 4 while standing on the road look over toward the shed the guard up on the balcony of the far building can see you if youre not careful wise to shoot him and remove that risk shoot the camera looking at the entrance to the shed 5 go inside the shed and take whatever loot you need 6 return to the longfin and drive to the drainage tunnel note that boat patrols are not hostile toward you as long as youre unarmed youre posing as a smuggler they think youre supposed to be there 7 once near the drainage tunnel stop the boat back a ways to make it easier to swim to the marker dive in the water and press left on the dpad to equip a rebreather swim to the grate and cut it open do not stress you will not run out of breath each rebreather lasts a long time and you have 20 of them youre fine swim through the tunnel and accept this as your entry point 8 you exit through a door and youve initiated a checkpoint if you die from here forward you will respawn right here with your previous progress fully intact no stress youll be fine view this map of the route to rubios office 1 spawn point run forward and up the stairs 2 run along this wall the guards wont see you 3 this guard will walk away just make sure hes not coming toward you if he is wait 4 this guard will walk away wait for him to move hell walk into a small alcove where you can pistol whip him if you want but you can also just ignore him 5 this guard is on the top level ignore him for now but eventually youll run up and bonk him as he comes around a corner just keep an eye out and be ready 6 this guard never moves just sneak behind him now you should be in the office at the top floor of this building check the safe in the far corner of the room for some extra cash automatically grabbed then hack the elevator fingerprint hack its easy there are 8 segments of fingerprint and 8 options to choose from find the top of the finger print and put it in 1 then move to the second segment now find the top of the finger print then scroll to the next one thats 2 move to the third segment find the top of the fingerprint then scroll to the 3rd option follow this logic for the remaining segments literally do this for each line and youll nail it every time basement nothing to worry about down here if you are stealing bearer bonds pavel sends you the safe code just put in the correct code and youre done if stealing something from the glass case run the plasma cutter until about 75 heat then let it cool down to about 25 do this repeatedly and youll be through it in no time now head back up the elevator to the office escape the compound view this map of the escape route 1 from the office run all the way back down the stairs pass behind guard 2 i mislabeled he should be the 1 because hes the first you encounter but whatever 2 guard 1 if you did not deal with him on the way in is still walking his usual path just wait for him to walk into the alcove and pass behind him jumping over the railing and turning left to head toward the main gate 3 main gate theres one patrolling guard here just make sure hes walking away as soon as you enter the marker youre safe 4 note the juggernaut is walking around but hes easily avoided using this route just keep an eye and an ear out and make sure hes moving away before you hit the ground level escape cayo perico view this map of the final escape 1 turn left and run to the very tip of this bit of the island that juts out avoid vision cones theres only two that you may need to worry about but theyre easily avoided 2 when you reach the edge just walk down it dont jump dont try to combat roll just walk you might fall but you wont suffer serious injury 3 get in the water and dive under press left on the dpad to equip a rebreather then swim as low to the ground as you can rubio will come out in his helicopter no matter what it does not mean that you did something wrong but if youre low enough he wont spot you 4 swim this direction as soon as you see the whale bones swim to them and the mission will end elite challenges 1 complete in under 15 minutes this run with a little practice can be done in under 13 minutes with no sweat including the additional stop at the air strip shed i got hung up trying to swim to the drainage tunnel and still managed a 1236 on my last effort and that was without rushing 2 do not get spotted if you follow this guide you wont 3 fill your bag if you follow the loot table and recommendations youll have a full bag 4 dont fail the hack you wont fail it if you understand how it works follow my advice and this hack is impossible to fail 5 do not restart this is the one that might cost you the elite challenge until youve practiced it a bit after a few tries youll have it worked out well enough that you can run this without needing to restart final advicenotes take your time there is no rush here at all each and every one of these steps can be taken at your own pace so just slow down and breathe this guide is meant to give you an easy run to get used to cayo perico this is not the most efficient best paying or fastest run possible use this run to build off of and experiment it teaches you the basics to help you understand the mechanics of the heist which lowers the overall difficulty immensely good luck and

    "is a portable cooler suitable for car journeys hey everyone so ive been doing a lot of road trips lately and one thing thats been bugging me is keeping drinks and snacks cold without stopping every few hours at gas stations i started looking into portable coolers for my car and honestly theyve been a game changer why i think theyre perfect for road trips first off let me just say that having a portable cooler in your vehicle is way more convenient than those oldschool ice chests no more dealing with melting ice or soggy sandwiches most electric coolers nowadays plug right into your cars 12v outlet which means they keep running while you drive i used to pack regular coolers with tons of ice but by hour three of my trip everything would be sitting in water not fun when youre trying to grab a cold drink or some cheese for the kids what makes them work in cars the main thing is that modern portable cooling units are designed specifically for travel theyre compact enough to fit in your backseat or trunk without taking up the entire space plus they actually maintain consistent temperature which is something traditional coolers cant do once that ice starts melting i found some really solid options when i was shopping around if youre interested id recommend checking out these portable coolers that work great for automotive use theyve got different sizes depending on how much storage space you need my experience using one ive been using mine for about four months now on weekend getaways and longer drives the biggest benefit i can keep medications cool important for my mom who rides with us store fresh food for camping and always have cold water available no more paying crazy prices at rest stops the power consumption is pretty minimal too i was worried it would drain my battery but as long as your engine is running youre totally fine some models even have battery protection features that prevent them from killing your car battery when parked things to consider not all portable coolers are created equal though you want something with good insulation and reliable cooling performance also check the capacity because some are pretty small and might not fit everything you need for a family trip sound insulation matters too some cheaper models can be noisy which gets annoying on long drives read reviews before buying anything bottom line if you do regular car journeys whether its commuting road trips or camping adventures a portable cooler is definitely worth it it pays for itself pretty quickly when you stop buying overpriced cold drinks and food on the road for anyone interested in grabbing one you can browse different models and sizes right here theyve got options for different budgets and needs hope this helps anyone whos been on the fence about getting one let me know if you have questions about using them in vehicles",

    "the car wars the chinese transformed themselves into an industrial powerhouse after deng xiaopings reforms lifted an agrarian nation into the industrial age following chinas accession to the world trade organization in 2001 beijings ambition to become the worlds factory was realized but one frontier remained impervious to chinese mastery automobiles for decades that domain belonged to germany japan and the united states which perfected the art of building cars through a century of engineering evolution a technological opening then came electrification the shift to electric vehicles evs has transformed the automobile from a combustion marvel into a software and batterydriven machine that is simpler lighter and more modular the sophisticated expertise that had protected legacy automakers for 100 years was suddenly obsolete the ev revolution neutralized the very complexity that defined western dominance for china this was more than an industrial opportunity it was a strategic destiny beijing saw evs as a convergence of manufacturing scale energy security and geopolitical control the ccp didnt just want to participate in the green transition it sought to own it electric cars were easier to make batteries were easier to scale and crucially china controlled the minerals they relied on the industrial chessboard was reset economics of scale or scale without economics from an economic lens this shift is staggering chinas automotive export machine expanded from under one million cars in 2018 to over 55 million by 2024 making it the worlds largest exporter in 2025 alone a record 3 million vehicles were exported in the first half of the year driven largely by new energy vehicles nevs and hybrids chinese carmakers now command nearly 40 of all global ev exports and four out of every ten electric cars shipped worldwide are made in china yet this triumph hides deep financial strain overcapacity and price wars plague the domestic market the nation can build 55 million vehicles a year but sells barely half profit margins for most automakers hover around 4 compared to over 10 in north america titans like byd and geely face shrinking returns even byds 2025 secondquarter profits fell by nearly 30 as prices plunged chinas automotive expansion is not driven by market economics its driven by industrial momentum and political design finance and the model of state capitalism this distortion is rooted in finance since 2009 beijing has poured over 230 billion into subsidies tax breaks and direct funding for ev and battery industries local governments complement this with cheap land zerointerest loans and grants for rd these are not investments for profitability they are strategic instruments in a national campaign the chinese communist party unconcerned by corporate losses demands market share not profit margins the logic is clear dominate now balance sheets later the result is a distorted financial ecosystem where capacity grows faster than consumption prices race to the bottom and debtfinanced competition fuels selfcannibalization but this subsidized scaling has global spillovers it compresses global ev prices and depresses margins for competitors european and american firms must operate under market discipline shareholder returns regulatory scrutiny and labour constraints while chinese firms operate under state cushioning the outcome isnt fair competition its industrial asymmetry taking refuge under free market and globalization principles the chinese dont play by the rules of the west they go through to make their own geopolitics beijings chessboard the car war isnt just commercial its geopolitical for beijing automotive dominance is energy diplomacy wrapped in industrial strategy electric vehicles sever oil dependence insulating china from maritime chokepoints like the strait of malacca while doubling its global economic leverage through battery exports and rare earth control chinas command of the ev supply chain is unmatched it refines 70 of global lithium processes 85 of rare earths and produces threequarters of the worlds ev batteries this is not free market happenstance but the outcome of two decades of strategic planning through policies like made in china 2025 and the 14th fiveyear industrial plan in contrast europe finds itself trapped between regulatory ideals and industrial vulnerability germanys auto industry the jewel of postwar capitalism is faltering volkswagens sales in china are declining as domestic chinese brands leap ahead on battery range software and affordability mercedes and bmw face tariff barriers abroad and market shrinkage at home while saicowned mg sells more evs across europe than most native brands the german economic miracle that once powered the eu is now being undercut by chinese overcapacity and precision western capitalism in the shape of automotive giants is stopping the eu from taking preventive actions policy paralysis beijings biggest strength supply chains the great reshaping no discussion of the car wars can ignore the supply chain revolution that made them possible china rebuilt the automotive supply chain into a vertically integrated empire from raw minerals to finished vehicles firms like catl and byd exemplify this integration producing batteries semiconductors electronics and vehicles under one roof this compression slashes costs improves operating margins and ensures logistical sovereignty legacy western manufacturers stretched globally over decades creating fragile supply chains spanning continents the pandemic shattered those illusions meanwhile china used the crisis as a consolidation moment reshoring components securing longterm mineral contracts in africa and south america and investing through its belt and road initiative bri through bri china built rail corridors in central asia and ports in africa that now carry not coal or grain but cars china is also eyeing the emerging northern sea corridor rendered navigable by global warming and envisioned by russia as a future trade artery to shorten routes to europe cut transit costs and improve operating margins across whatever flows through its industrial engine chinas export offensive was logistical as much as industrial ports like shanghai and guangzhou were redesigned for roro rollonrolloff vehicle exports byd now operates its own carrier fleet of oceangoing vessels capable of hauling thousands of cars across continents bypassing western logistics chokepoints this selfreliance secures the arteries of global automotive trade the bri also multiplied trade corridors turning inland manufacturing hubs like chongqing into automotive gateways to europe via rail in regions like the middle east and latin america chinese automakers replicate this model exporting not just cars but entire supply ecosystems from dealerships to charging grids germanys automakers once relied on supply efficiency and brand prestige now they face a player with both the means of production and distribution hardwired into national policy policy and governance commanding an industry the governance of chinas automotive rise reflects the countrys hybrid political economy centralized coordination with market discipline at the periphery chinas ministry of industry and information technology acts less as a regulator and more as a national commander the state decides which enterprises merge which technologies survive and which components receive export licenses in 2025 beijing introduced export licensing for evs ostensibly to manage quality but effectively to control global supply and pricing dynamics meanwhile new nev production regulations restrict license issuance aiming to rein in disorderly competition these moves blend macroeconomic management with strategic foresight the west governed by fragmented markets and legalistic oversight has no equivalent machinery indeed what europe and the us now face is industrial policy as foreign policy business and market dynamics in business terms chinas automakers behave less like competitors and more like soldiers in a single campaign byd geely chery and saic exploit different geographies and price segments under a coordinated national strategy the result is a globally synchronized offensive byd targets emerging markets like brazil thailand and south africa with locally assembled evs priced below 20000 geely and mg on the other hand attack midtier european markets with sleek designs and aggressive financing and warranty options the collective aim is to flood every price point simultaneously as i say profit is not the goal saturation is legacy automakers bound by quarterly earnings and esg boards simply cannot match this tempo their capital discipline once an advantage now acts like a brake against statebacked relentlessness remember the volkswagen diesel gate scandal the engineers at vw found it easier to fudge the emissions levels amidst the growing pressure of stricter emissions regulations and lofty state climate pledges and economic realities to deal with investor expectations at every earnings call all the while when beijing was focused on building ree rare earth elements capacity overlooking the environmental hazards finance and global markets internationally chinas autofinancial complex is rewiring global capital flows the countrys automakers raise cheap credit from state banks tap domestic bonds and even issue green bonds under climate initiatives branding themselves as the financial face of sustainable mobility meanwhile western oems struggle with capitalintensive transitions squeezed between investor demands and soaring ev rd costs global investors face a paradox chinas auto sector offers scale and growth but not transparency or profits yet multinational funds still pour in betting on state guarantees and industrial longevity thus financial globalization becomes the enabler of this very asymmetry the green transition and strategic overlap ironically the wests green transition a cornerstone of its climate agenda has deepened its dependence on china europes emission goals battery regulations and subsidy schemes incentivize ev adoption but inadvertently accelerate chinese dominance in the supply chain in 2025 roughly half the evs sold in the eu had madeinchina labelled batteries chinas government shrewdly casts this as global climate leadership massive ev deployment aligns with carbon neutrality pledges while cementing export power the result is a geopolitical inversion green transition policies in brussels and washington now fuel economic leverage in beijing environmental concerns thus converge with industrial ambition china is leveraging decarbonization for economic weaponization the strategic reckoning western policymakers now face a brutal dilemma protect the green transition or protect the domestic industry tariffs production subsidies and localization mandates are bandaids against an industrial earthquake germany has quietly supported eu tariffs even as its carmakers plead for exemptions in china but to deal with this what the old continent lacks is policy unity meanwhile the united states under president trumps revived trade nationalism enforces 100 tariffs on chinese evs and 60 on chinese goods overall yet even with america largely closed the scale of chinese overproduction guarantees global fallout supply will flow somewhere and flood prices everywhere the inevitable fallout what happens when overcapacity meets decarbonization finance meets politics and globalization devolves into industrial warfare the world gets what i call the car wars a battle not for profit but for survival for china its a managed war of attrition meant to consolidate global mobility supply chains under its industrial order for the west it is economic containment under the guise of climate ethics the wests choice is stark follow chinas model of industrial statecraft with democratic transparency or brace for longterm deindustrialization in cars the crown jewel of 20thcentury capitalism and a symbol of postwar prosperity especially in the us as chinese ships laden with electric sedans glide from ningbo to rotterdam the message is clear the age of the automotive west has given way to the era of the industrial east economics finance business policy and climate are no longer separate spheres they are fronts in a single global conflict fought over mobility power and the control of the green future the ccp doesnt believe in a consumptionled economy industrial might or exportled growth as a playbook which has brought it to stiff domestic competition and industrial overcapacity how china deals with its

    "michael burrys bytesized warning to the ai bulls original article as nvidias trilliondollar ai empire expands michael burry the man who called the 2008 crash warns that big techs obsession with shortlived chips and creative accounting could turn the ai boom into the next financial bubble the world has seen its share of speculative frenzies from the dotcom boom to the crypto craze investors have always been drawn to the promise of endless growth now artificial intelligence has become the latest obsession and nvidia corp nasdaq nvda stands at its epicenter its powerful chips are the foundation of modern ai driving record profits stock rallies and trilliondollar valuations yet amid the euphoria one seasoned skeptic is once again raising a red flag michael burry the man who famously predicted the 2008 financial crisis believes the math behind the ai boom doesnt add up the warning cuts to the core of the ai economy depreciation the chips powering this revolution have short lives falling in value fast as new models roll out the result a system that depends on perpetual reinvestment and creative accounting to look sustainable the short life of ais golden machines every revolution needs its tools and for ai those tools are nvidias gpusgraphicsprocessing units capable of handling the colossal calculations behind models like chatgpt each one costs tens of thousands of dollars and together they make up a huge portion of the roughly 400 billion that the worlds largest technology companies plan to spend on ai infrastructure this year analysts expect that figure to swell to nearly 3 trillion by 2029 but unlike factories or fiberoptic networks these chips dont last their typical lifespan is around five years after which they become technologically obsolete nvidias chief executive officer jensen huang halfjoked earlier this year that once its nextgeneration blackwell chips start shipping you couldnt give hoppers away that may have been said in jest but it highlights a serious truthai hardware loses value almost as quickly as smartphones this short shelf life is forcing the biggest hyperscalers amazon nasdaq amzn microsoft nasdaq msft and alphabet inc nasdaq googl into a spending cycle that never ends to stay competitive they must constantly refresh their data centers with the latest silicon what was once a oneoff investment has become a treadmill of recurring costs and the financial implications are staggering michael burrys growing concern burry isnt disputing ais potential hes questioning its economics his argument centers on the depreciation schedules these companies are using to justify their massive capital spending by stretching the useful life of their servers from four years to six or even seven companies make their profits appear higherbecause theyre spreading out the cost of their hardware over more years meta platforms inc nasdaq meta for example boosted its net income by nearly 2 billion in the first nine months of 2025 by extending the assumed lifespan of its servers meanwhile amazon nasdaq amzn quietly reversed course this year cutting its estimate back to five years after acknowledging an increased pace of technology development that subtle move signaled what burry has been warning the hardware is aging faster than anyone wants to admit he calls it a depreciation tsunami as each new generation of chips arrives the value of the last one plummets what looks like smart investment today could become a costly burden tomorrow especially for firms that rely heavily on debt to finance their expansion the dangerous world of ai debt the ai boom isnt just being fueled by corporate cash its increasingly powered by borrowed money privatecredit giants like blackstone inc nyse bx magnetar capital and macquarie group ltd asx mqg are providing loans backed by ai hardware some of these loans use nvidia gpus as collaterala striking parallel to the mortgagebacked securities that underpinned the housing bubble before 2008 even nvidia itself is reportedly exploring structured financing models including specialpurpose vehicles designed to buy and lease gpus to major customers like openai coreweave inc and xai the artificialintelligence startup founded by elon musk coreweave nasdaq crwv in particular epitomizes the risks of this new aifinance frontier once a small cloudcomputing startup it now sports a valuation north of 50 billion and a debt load approaching 17 billion including lease liabilities the company is using that money to fund as much as 14 billion in capital expenditures this yearan amount that rivals the annual spending of oil giants like shell plc lse shel coreweave insists its business model is sustainable thanks to longterm contracts with investmentgrade clients but if gpu values fall faster than expectedor if ai demand weakensthose contracts could unravel quickly for burry and others the warning signs are familiar massive leverage rapid depreciation and an unshakeable belief that the future will always be profitable when the hype meets hard reality the entire ai economy hinges on one assumption that demand for computing power will continue to rise indefinitely as long as companies believe that the spending continues the borrowing expands and nvidias share price keeps soaring yet the underlying assets are decaying fast rental prices for nvidias oncecoveted a100 ampere and hopper chips have plunged down 30 or more this year according to industry trackers meanwhile electricity constraints and datacenter bottlenecks are adding new costs that could make older hardware uneconomical to operate nvidias success depends on constant innovation but that same innovation accelerates obsolescence its a paradox that even its ceo acknowledges the faster the chips improve the faster the value of existing infrastructure collapses investors may take comfort in the profits of today but burrys warning suggests that tomorrows balance sheets could tell a harsher story the ai revolution is realbut so are the costs hiding beneath its glossy surface conclusion the ai era has ushered in a new industrial revolution powered by silicon instead of steel nvidias brilliance big techs ambition and wall streets appetite have created a trilliondollar machine that seems unstoppable but as michael burry reminds us even the most dazzling technologies obey the laws of economics depreciation doesnt care about hype hardware ages margins shrink and optimism fades the question isnt whether ai will transform the world it already has the question is whether investors will recognize the risks before the next great bubble bursts",

    "best bang for buck lease offers for november 2025 how i calculate lease deals to make it a fair comparison when manufacturers promote lease offers there is no rule that limits how they can structure the deal many will advertise low monthly payments but require a large down payment in essence there is nothing stopping a manufacturer from advertising 1 monthly payment but requiring a large down payment small print in the disclaimer car shoppers will see low monthly payments but not realize its actually not a good lease deal because the down payment is so large the other thing manufacturers sometimes do is structure the lease deals with much lower annual mileage allowances like 5000 or 7500 miles per year while most lease offers include 12000 miles you have to pay more to get more miles it usually costs about 1012 cents per mile therefore i always recalculate all lease deals with 0 down payment 12k miles per year 10k for luxury vehicles lease acquisition fee included so you can compare these monthly payments apples to apples across all models taxes and dealer fees are not included because these can differ from city to city these deals require excellent credit usually 720 minimum with some exceptions down to 700 if you dont have good credit but are absolutely sure you can make the monthly payments find a cosigner who has good credit they will be on the hook if you cant pay so dont do this unless you are sure you can handle the payments what is bang for buck it shows how much vehicle msrp value you get for each dollar you spend on the monthly payment it is a simple calculation msrp divided by the monthly payment calculated with 0 down payment the average across all lease deals nationwide is about 78 the higher the better anything over 100 is generally an exceptional lease deal what does required mean some lease deals require special rebates to qualify for the offer loyalty this means you must currently own or lease the same brand of vehicle to qualify for the offer conquest this means you must currently own or lease a competing brand of vehicle to qualify employee this means you must be an employee or live in a household with an employee of the manufacturer",
    "a fix for frost engineers use electricity to zap ice without heat or chemicals every sheet of frost contains ionic defects the viginia tech team uses high voltage to polarize these ions rip off the frost virginia tech researchers have developed electrostatic defrosting edf an energyefficient and environmentally friendly deicing method that uses an electric field to dislodge frost by manipulating the natural electrical charges within ice crystals this technique uses an overhead electrode to create an electric field causing negative ions to be attracted upward and positive ions to be repelled downward thereby breaking the ices bond with the surface without using heat or chemicals the team led by associate professor jonathan boreyko published its findings in the journal small methods with potential applications for aircraft vehicles and other equipment mechanism as frost forms it develops natural positive and negative charges due to imperfections in its crystal structure application edf applies a high voltage to an electrode placed above the frost result the resulting electric field forces the charged ions in the ice to move which breaks the frosts grip on the surface advantages this method is more energyefficient than traditional heating methods and avoids the environmental impact of chemical deicers potential applications the researchers hope to eventually make this technology accessible for consumer use such as on car windshields study findings",

    "the diamond wheezers britains greatest heist by grandpas the vault easter weekend 2015 hatton garden london someone is drilling through a concrete wall the sound echoes in the darkness this is the heart of londons diamond district and the drill bit is chewing through 50 centimetres of reinforced concrete leading directly into a vault containing hundreds of safe deposit boxes filled with millions in jewels gold and cash the man operating the hilti dd 350 industrial drill is 67 years old hes diabetic he has heart problems kidney disease he brought his medications with him because this job will take two nights and he cant miss a dose his name is terry perkins and hes already served 22 years in prison for robbing 6 million in the 1983 security express raid now hes back for one last score behind him three other men watch and wait their combined age is 448 years the youngest is 61 the oldest is 76 theyre using free bus passes to travel across london they look like somebodys grandfathers and theyre about to pull off the largest burglary in english legal history three years earlier january 2012 islington north london brian reader sits in the castle pub nursing a pint hes 73 years old supposedly retired living comfortably in dartford with his free pensioners bus pass but retirement doesnt suit him it never has reader isnt an ordinary pensioner in 1983 he was involved in the brinksmat robbery at heathrow airport 26 million in gold and diamonds still britains largest gold heist he served nine years for handling the stolen bullion he was also implicated in the murder of detective constable john fordham during the investigation though he was acquitted on selfdefence grounds now decades later reader is planning again hes been researching watching calculating for three years he will meticulously plot what the press will later call one last dream job he meets with old friends at the castle daniel jones 58 career criminal who was arrested in 2010 for raiding bond street jewellers terry perkins 64 fresh from his security express sentence john kenny collins 72 experienced in breakins despite his age they drink they talk they remember past scores and slowly carefully reader begins to outline his plan the target is hatton garden safe deposit company a vault in the heart of londons diamond district hundreds of boxes belonging to jewellers dealers and people who dont trust banks no one knows exactly whats inside those boxes which makes them irresistible the take could be 14 million maybe 29 million possibly more one of them will later say lets show the digital generation what the old school can do the mystery man but readers crew has a problem theyre oldschool criminals they know how to pick locks disable mechanical alarms avoid physical surveillance but modern security systems are different digital computercontrolled they need someone with technical expertise someone introduces them to a man known only as basil basil is tall and lanky with distinctive reddish hair he appears to have intimate knowledge of security systems he knows door codes he has a key to the front entrance of the hatton garden building he understands how to disable the alarm system in ways that even police will struggle to explain later daniel jones will later write from prison basil was the brains he let me in on the night of the burglary he hid keys and codes throughout the building i saw basil about four times throughout he came and went i dont know anything about him where he lives i wasnt interested jones also claims something explosive basil was a former police officer who got into security work but no one knows who basil really is not even his coconspirators he wears a cap at all times carries a bin bag on his shoulder to obscure his face from cameras wears no distinctive clothing moves with calculated precision for three years after the heist basil will remain a complete phantom good friday 2015 april 3 2015 917 pm a white van pulls up outside 8890 hatton garden its good friday the start of the easter long weekend the building is closed the streets are quiet the timing is perfect basil uses his key to open the front door the alarm doesnt sound hes already disabled it somehow the gang enters reader perkins jones and one other collins at 75 stays outside as the lookout they take the elevator down to the basement then they climb down the lift shaft to access the vault level this part requires physical strength and agility that men in their seventies shouldnt possess but somehow they manage the vault door itself is impenetrable but the gang has studied the buildings blueprints adjacent to the vault is a storage room the wall between the storage room and the vault is concrete but its thinner than the vault door this is their entry point perkins sets up the hilti dd 350 drill the drill bit is 10 centimetres in diameter the wall is 50 centimetres thick this will take hours he begins drilling the sound is enormous but its good friday night the building is empty no one hears 1221 am april 4 2015 an intruder alarm triggers the signal goes to southern monitoring a private security company the call is graded no police response required a catastrophic misjudgement that will later become a scandal a security guard is dispatched instead the guard arrives at the building later that morning he looks through the front door sees nothing obviously wrong the gang has been careful he doesnt enter the building he leaves inside the vault the gang continues working unaware of how close they came to being caught by saturday morning theyve drilled through the wall but now they hit a problem the hole isnt quite wide enough they need to drill more and theyre exhausted theyre old men and theyve been working all night brian reader the mastermind makes a decision he says something that will later be documented in court testimony anything we do from this point on were making it up and thats where mistakes are made reader wants to leave take what they can and go but the others want more theyve come this far why stop now reader feeling unwell leaves the others stay they widen the hole finally its large enough for a man to squeeze through they enter the vault rows and rows of safe deposit boxes line the walls hundreds of them the gang doesnt know which boxes contain the most valuable items so they start breaking them open systematically using crowbars drills and brute force they fill bags with jewels gold ingots cash watches precious stones more than they can carry they work through saturday night and into sunday morning by the time they leave theyve ransacked 73 boxes when they finally climb back up the lift shaft load the bags into the white van and drive away theyve stolen anywhere from 14 million to 200 million depending on whose estimate you believe its the largest burglary in english legal history and they got away clean the digital detectives april 7 2015 tuesday morning businesses return after the long weekend someone opens the vault door at hatton garden safe deposit the scene is chaos broken boxes scattered papers tools left behind a massive hole in the wall police are called immediately flying squad detectives arrive they begin documenting the crime scene collecting evidence reviewing cctv footage and immediately they notice something strange about these criminals detective peter spindler head of specialist crime investigations will later summarize it perfectly they were analogue criminals operating in a digital world they lacked the knowledge to defeat digital detectives the gang had been extraordinarily careful during the heist itself but theyd made critical mistakes in the planning phase the mercedes for reconnaissance and surveillance in the weeks before the heist the gang used a distinctive white mercedes e200 with a black roof and alloy wheels this vehicle was photographed repeatedly on hatton gardens streets by cctv cameras the license plate led directly to john kenny collins age 75 one vehicle one license plate the entire conspiracy begins to unravel the mobile phones for three years during planning the gang had used their own mobile phones to communicate and coordinate every call created records every text message was logged cell tower data showed their locations detectives traced collinss calls to other gang members the records revealed not just who was communicating with whom but also where calls were made from the data corroborated conspiracy showing the men meeting repeatedly at the castle pub and other locations for the actual heist theyd used walkietalkies to avoid creating call records but by then it was too late the planning phase communications had already mapped the entire network the bugs once investigators identified the core suspects they obtained authorization to install listening devices in their vehicles they bugged the mercedes and terry perkinss car what they recorded was devastating the gang members spoke carelessly boasting about the heist discussing their shares of the loot making incriminating admissions in one conversation on may 15 collins said the cash robbery history at time and now the biggest tom the fucking that what they and a book could write fucking hell they were proud of what theyd done and they couldnt resist talking about it may 19 2015 1000 am two hundred police officers in riot gear simultaneously raid 12 addresses across london and kent the timing is crucial strike everyone at once so no one can warn the others or destroy evidence at one address officers recover approximately 43 million in stolen goods hidden in black bags about onethird of the total take daniel jones had hidden his share under a memorial stone in edmonton cemetery two bags of jewels buried in a graveyard the physical evidence combined with communication records bugging transcripts and cctv footage provides an overwhelming prosecution case by the end of may most of the gang is in custody except basil the ghost for three years basil remains free police know he exists hes on surveillance footage tall and lanky with reddish hair always carrying a bin bag to obscure his face but they dont know who he is the red hair is probably a wig he wears no distinctive clothing leaves no fingerprints makes no mistakes was he a former security guard whod worked at hatton garden a former police officer as jones claimed a customer whod been given a tour of the vault an international criminal operative hired specifically for his technical expertise the mystery of how he disabled the alarm system remains partially unexplained the alarm triggered briefly during the operation but basil somehow prevented a full breach the specific methodology is never fully clarified for three years basil is a ghost march 27 2018 600 am early morning raid on a flat in liverpool road islington just two miles from hatton garden police find michael john seed age 58 sitting on a treasure trove over 143000 in gold ingots gems and jewellery scattered around his bedroom evidence that hes been systematically melting down gold and breaking up jewellery on his bedroom workbench bit by bit preparing to sell it through black market contacts michael seed is basil at trial seed denies everything he claims he might have been on a family holiday in cornwall or visiting his elderly mother in cambridge during the heist he denies taking 80000 to 90000 in cash to portugal he claims to be running a legitimate jewellery business but prosecutors note hes filed no tax returns produced no invoices no receipts no bank transfers and cannot name a single customer in march 2019 a jury convicts seed by a 102 majority vote on conspiracy to burgle and unanimously on conspiracy to handle stolen goods hes sentenced to 10 years in prison judge christopher kinch declares your role was a central one you were at the heart of the core activities that had to be carried out you were not just there to fetch and carry in my judgment this must rank among the worst offences of its type seed is ordered to pay back 599768493 within three months or face an additional seven years in jail he cannot pay the money is gone why did they do it this is the question that makes this case so different these werent desperate young men needing quick cash they were pensioners some were comfortable reader had a substantial house in dartford theyd survived decades of criminal activity they could have retired peacefully so why risk everything for one last score professor david wilson from birmingham city university explains you can almost picture the joy and excitement that planning would bring i imagine the more they spoke about it the more excited they became this was the one last dream job there is a great deal of excitement in committing this kind of crime there is a great deal of status attached to it for men whod spent their entire lives some from childhood in the criminal underworld retirement was unbearable criminality wasnt just a job it was their identity the thrill of planning the risktaking the respect from peers in the criminal fraternity were intoxicating in ways legitimate retirement could never provide freddie foreman a criminal kingpin now 83 was asked if he would have joined them his answer reveals the compulsion if theyd asked me to join them i might have found it hard to say no even though my legs arent what they used to be its the excitement the respect you get and its the thought of doing one last job one last job one final legendary score to cement their legacy generational pride proof that oldschool criminal methodology street smarts and patience could still out maneuver modern security systems they were wrong of course modern digital forensics destroyed them but the compulsion was irresistible the mysteries that remain the missing millions only 43 million was recovered the heist was valued anywhere from 14 million to 200 million depending on estimates that means between 9 million and 195 million in stolen goods remains missing where is it some was melted down by seed over three years some was sold on international black markets but much of it has simply vanished with brian readers death in september 2023 kept secret by his family for months the secrets of where the remaining millions are hidden quite possibly died with him the holborn fire on april 1 2015 just hours before the heist began a major electrical fire erupted in holborns kingsway the fire caused an enormous power outage closing major roads and businesses across central london for days john oconnor former head of scotland yards flying squad publicly suggested the fire might have been deliberately set as part of the heist planning i think that probably was deliberate ive never heard of an outage of electricity like that causing a fire that lasted as long as that that seems to me too much of a coincidence his theory the fire was meant to create chaos distract police and emergency services and potentially disable security systems in the area no evidence has ever emerged linking the gang to the fire it remains officially classified as an accident but the timing is striking the inside job question could this heist have been executed without inside help a security guard with over 20 years of experience testified that the level of knowledge required knowing exactly where cameras were which alarm codes would disable the system how to access the lift shaft without triggering secondary alarms strongly suggested inside information police investigated current and former employees of all companies in the building but found no conclusive evidence but the question is did basil have an inside contact had he previously worked there was someone feeding him information the alarm that triggered during the operation but didnt result in police response suggests either extraordinary luck or someone with insider knowledge of how the alarm company would handle the call terry perkinss death terry perkins died in belmarsh prison in february 2018 just days after being ordered to pay 65 million or face an additional seven years he was 69 suffering from severe heart failure kidney disease and bronchopneumonia the day before his death his fitted defibrillator shocked him three times at 345 pm when a nurse tried to examine him that evening he refused because he was watching england play italy in the six nations rugby the official cause was acute cardiac failure but perkins had written extensive notes about alleged failings in prison medical care cancelled appointments improperly administered medications his daughter asked the coroner to investigate no foul play was suggested but the circumstances raise questions did systemic failures in prison healthcare contribute to his death did the psychological stress of the 65 million order play a role brian readers secret death brian reader died on september 16 2023 at age 84 his family kept the death secret for months the death certificate lists his profession as retired gardener a retired gardener not the mastermind of the brinksmat robbery investigation not the orchestrator of britains greatest heist a gardener reader suffered multiple strokes in prison and struggled with health problems after his release in 2018 but his death raises the ultimate question did critical information about the missing millions die with him did he know where all the loot was hidden did he take secrets about basils true background or any insider connections to his grave the films got it wrong three major films have told the hatton garden story and all made significant departures from reality the hatton garden job 2017 invented a fictional handler character and alleged hungarian mafia financiers an entire layer of external financing and organized crime involvement not supported by investigation or court records king of thieves 2018 starred michael caine as reader in a film that softened the gangs behavior presenting them as lovable rogues with charm and redeeming qualities court testimony paints a grimmer picture of men who were ruthless calculating and entirely indifferent to the devastating impact on victims many of whom lost their livelihoods the 2019 itv series hatton garden came closest to accuracy using actual police surveillance transcripts and consulting with retired flying squad chief peter spindler but even this definitive version made editorial choices about what to dramatize and what to omit what all the films underplay is the victim impact small jewellery businesses storing inventory without adequate insurance individuals with family heirlooms and irreplaceable sentimental items businesspeople whose entire livelihoods were in those boxes people who relied on safe deposit services specifically because they didnt trust banks the films romanticize the gang the reality is uglier the lookout who fell asleep one detail perfectly captures the absurdity of this entire operation john kenny collins age 75 was the designated lookout during the heist and during the actual raid security personnel observed him sleeping at his post this is the gang that pulled off britains greatest burglary old men with medical conditions free bus passes and a lookout who couldnt stay awake",
    "a little big ficnap of terran zoology when i got tapped for a rescue from this round i was happy to oblige especially after ustillperformance39 did such a fantastic job ficnapping i had a couple of ideas but after just finishing the crossover in lbp i quickly focused in on what kind of lesson bernard would give to his students in that aus setting thanks to sp15 for nop and thanks to ugiantacroyear for running the ficnap every time terran zoology memory transcription subject rysel venlil environmental researcher date standardized human time 3rd december 2136 the human was already on the podium when we filed in i tried not to stare but that was getting harder with every lesson dr bernard macewan stood at the edge of his little platform like he was about to address a stadium shoulders squared pawshandsfolded on top of his cane the podium itself was barely kneehigh to a venlil a glassfronted box perched on the main stage with handrails and a tiny ramp up one side someone had even put a cup of water there that looked comically huge next to him like a trough beside a particularly dignified rodent not even half a tail of predator if i hadnt known better i would have mistaken him for some kind of animatronic museum display the projector screen behind him towered over everything and he was nothing but a dark silhouette against the blue loading screen nothing but a silhouette and still the room felt anchored a soft hum of calm lay under the usual prelesson chatter my own pulse had been racing out of habit but every time i glanced toward the podium it eased like my body was taking its cues from the rest of the herd maybe there was a human echo in it at this distance whatever their strange empathy did was only ever a faint tickle at the back of my mind so this is what its like when theyre relaxed stop staring sandi whispered bumping her shoulder against mine her grey wool brushed my arm cool and soft youre going to burn a hole right through him i am not staring i hissed back forcing my eyes down to my pad my tail betrayed me by curling in tight nervous loops im observing so am i i just dont look like someone dropped me in a predator den her tail swished amused that made my ears pin flat it was true of course after the first few lessons someone in administration probably tolim had apparently decided the whole predatorsafety routine was a bit much for a tiny softspoken old man who to my rattled nerves might as well have been the emotional equivalent of a warm duskleaf tea the red warning light above the door stayed dark now the recorded message had been shortened the face shield was gone he really wasnt anywhere near as scary as my imagination had conjured up with that mask on dr macewan looked up as the last of us shuffled into seats his eyes uncovered flicked across the room in a quick sweep before settling somewhere just above the first row large by human standards perhaps but from here they were pinpricks of brown no more menacing than a pair of seeds still forwardfacing still unnerving the calmer part of me pointed out that his pupils tightened when someone tripped in the aisle and flailed for balance concern spiking from the front like a gentle pressure in my chest the rest of me hissed predator and tried not to think about his teeth alright class tolim called from the side of the hall his scruffy tan wool fluffed in a way that suggested he hadnt quite woken up find a seat please remember to keep the aisles clear put your pads to lecture mode a chorus of chimes sounded as pads switched over the projector behind the human flickered to life showing the familiar earth logo a little marble of bluegreen with white swirls floating in black beside it someone had added a new icona simple stickfigure human next to a much larger blocky venlil outline with a comically large question mark between them size of course that would come up sooner or later wed all been thinking it trying not to think it kailo dropped into the seat on my right with a thump his tail hitting the chair with more force than strictly necessary his voice slipped between my ears a moment later pitched just low enough to pretend he wasnt trying to be heard predator or not theyre still unnaturally small he muttered something had to go wrong somewhere i flicked an ear back in annoyance sandis tail stiffened but she kept her eyes forward before anybody could snap at him the tiny human at the front raised one hand good afternoon everyone he said accent thick and warm the translation unit on the podium repeated his words overlaying his actual voice i hope youre all well i know its been a long claw so ill try not to put you to sleep with slides a little ripple of amusement ran through the roomand against my will i felt my own ears twitch his contentment at the reaction showed in his face and voice and the room seemed to exhale with him smoothing the last ruffled nerves at the edges of the hall now he went on tapping a control pad nearly as big as his torso the stickfigure icon on the screen enlarged the venlil outline beside it stretching to full height theres an ah obvious thing we may as well address properly before it drives us all to distraction a few tails swished guiltily mine included weve had a number of questions submitted through the anonymous form about this his mouth quirked and some notsoanonymous ones shouted down the corridor so rather than dodge it i thought we could spend a little time on what it actually means that my peopleand the animals on our worldare the size that we are my ears pricked despite myself he was looking in our direction now not quite at us but over the top of our row it took a heartbeat for me to realize why sandis paw was halfway up hovering uncertainly stars of course shed be the first to ask ah yes he said brightening ms sandi isnt it her ears flushed orange yyes doctor please go ahead she swallowed tail wrapping around her ankles then forced herself to straighten i um this might be a stupid question there are no stupid questions in this course he said immediately and absolutely meant it the reassurance settled in my wool like a warm gust only ones we havent answered yet please sandis shoulders eased a fraction alright its just she glanced at the projection then down at him are you the only ones that small i meanare your animals and plants the same size too or did something happen to you to make you like this kailo made a faint chuffing noise at my side i resisted the urge to kick him dr macewan looked thoughtful for a moment the lines at the corners of his eyes deepening when he spoke his calm settled even further like hed braced himself carefully on the inside before answering thats an excellent question sandi thank you he said and no nothing happened to us as far as all of our evidence goesour fossils our genetics the way our ecosystems are structuredwe didnt used to be your size and then shrink down like a frightened burrowrat a few quiet chuckles at his choice of analogy i couldnt help it the image of a giant human folding into itself like an overcooked bruntcake was absurd enough to kick at my nerves he smiled tiny teeth flashing but all i felt from him was airy amusement we appear to have evolved at this size from the very beginning he continued our earliest animal fossils our own hominin ancestors the trees that formed our first forestseverything weve found belongs to more or less the same absolute size range as we have now the venlil outline on the screen faded leaving only the human figure beside a series of silhouettes a fourlegged grazer a low lean predatorshape a stylized tree and some kind of strangelyproportioned sea creature all of our predators and prey he said pointing with his cane as each lit up our herbivores our marine life our plants they all grew up together on a very large planet in very small bodies tolim whistled softly from the side wall so its not just you that are tiny its your whole world quite so pride and wonder colored the little mans voice tinged with something like homesickness until six months ago we had no reason to think that was unusual to us a wolf is large a whale is huge and a tree is well a tree i filed the strange new words away for later he shrugged then we met all of you and discovered that weve spent the last few hundred thousand years living quite happily at the bottom end of whats possible except the dossur kailo interjected louder this time theyre about your size arent they mm yes bernard turned his head slightly angling one rounded ear toward us the dossur are similar to us in absolute height yes but from what your diplomats have shared their worlds plants and animals are closer to your scale tiny people big everything else another tap of the pad and a new set of silhouettes appeared a dossur stickfigure against towering trees and massive quadrupeds on earth he said switching back everything is small together the entire biosphere from our dragonflies to our dolphins has settled into a size regime that would be quite unremarkable to us and apparently rather surprising to the rest of the galaxy his eyes crinkled with quiet greedy joy at that so youre a statistical anomaly i heard myself say before id fully decided to speak my ears flared with heat as dozens of eyes turned my way of course couldnt keep my snout shut for one whole lesson but the humans attention focused on me like a warm lamp exactly rysel he said delighted were only just starting to realize how much of one though with the caveat that its been less than a year since first contact so were still very much at the scribbling wild ideas on napkins stage mild laughter the feeling of itcollective sheepish openrolled past me and back to the front and i could see the way it pleased him he really does love this i thought not for the first time he loves that his world is strange now bernard went on lightly tapping his cane on the podium if we stay on the question of why were small all afternoon well end up writing half a dozen speculative exobiology papers and never actually talk about the animals and i would hate to deprive you of the animals his eyes glinted as he said it and i felt that familiar reluctant spark of excitement at the promise of new animals so instead he said id like to show you what it means to be small on a large world how our size shapes the way our species move feed migrate and survive three quick case studies and i promise at least one of them involves something falling off a cliff and surviving kailo perked up visibly at the word survive as if hed been halfway to sharpening a rant and suddenly didnt know where to aim it the first slide changed the screen filled with grass not the neat domesticated hayfields of my rural surveys but a wild expanse of stems and seedheads that swayed like a living sea the camera must have been near ground level each blade towered overhead thick as a forearm the sky above a narrow strip of washedout blue there we are bernard said fondly this is a stormsteppe on one of our temperate continents the animals youre about to see live in a region that gets very strong seasonal stormshigh winds heavy rain remember that from their point of view each raindrop is a fairly substantial object the camera panned down a little herd emerged from between the stalks fourlegged shortnecked with curling horns and twitching ears they were no bigger relative to the grass than burrowrats in a wheat stand they were also maddeningly adorable these are a type of antelope we call stormrunners bernard narrated shortbodied grazers with ringed horns and big eyes fast and agile and highly social they spend most of their time above ground in loose herds clipping the seedheads and keeping watch over the burrow mouths the footage sped up slightly the herd fanned out nibbling at the tough seedheads tails flicking a distant rumble sounded the sky strip darkened a prickle ran up my spine as you can see the human continued calmly theyre in an environment that doesnt offer many large obstacles few trees almost no rocks out on a plain like this in weather like ours the safest place to be in a storm is below the ground the sound of wind climbed clouds boiled across the tiny strip of sky swallowing the sun the herd froze as one heads lifting ears straining in a way i felt deep in my ribs what youre feeling bernard said voice gentle is what they feel not words but patterns pressure electricity the way the air tastes the way light changes a lifetime of association between those cues and this the first raindrop hit the camera housing with a meaty thump i flinched around me i heard tiny gasps saw tails slam down the little antelope bolted they didnt scatter in senseless panic they pivoted in unison hooves churning soil charging for a cluster of darker shapes barely visible at the base of the screen another drop struck another the wind howled bending the grass flat for a moment the herd vanished completely swallowed by the storm of stems and water then the camera ducked plunging beneath the surface a tunnel roots panicbright eyes vanishing around corners bodies compressing to fit somewhere above impacts rattled the soil like distant drums most of their evolution bernard said quietly is not about outrunning teeth its about outrunning the sky sandis paw had found my arm at some point i didnt pull away the fear prickling at the back of my brain wasnt the sharp personal predator terror id come to dread it was older more abstract the idea of the whole firmament falling on you how many die sandi asked voice small in storms like that a fair number he admitted there was no grim satisfaction in it only sober respect young ones who misjudge the signals animals caught too far from their burrows those whose tunnels collapse its a significant selective pressure why dont they just stay underground she persisted ears drooping if its that dangerous he smiled sad and kind because the grass is up here he said they cant eat soil sandi theres a balance to be struck between safety and feeding if they never risked the surface theyd starve the ones you just saw are descendants of many many generations who learned exactly how long they can stay out i swallowed throat dry the sky as an apex predator my professional brain noted awed despite itself riskreward tradeoff defined by meteorology instead of fangs the slide changed again a sheer rock face appeared lit by bright sunlight the camera clung to it at some vertigoinducing angle looking across a chasm into a series of parallel ledges scrubby bushes clung to cracks tufts of tough grass sprouted wherever they could on one of the ledges five small shapes milled about these bernard said and there was unmistakable affection now are a group of mountain ungulates we call goatsspecifically a cliffdwelling species herbivores with surefooted hooves that live in places most of my species would describe as a terrible idea most came a voice from the back i turned enough to confirm that it was loki his ears perked forward bernard sighed yes for reasons that will be made clear shortly some of the more adventurous of my kind find the habitat of these animals a source of thrilling entertainment the camera zoomed in little cloven hooves stocky bodies absurdly confident eyes one of the goats paced along the narrow strip of rock the dropoff at the edge plummeting so far down that the bottom faded into haze now the human went on your instincts are telling you that if one of these animals slips thats it broken bones at best obliteration at worst and for a venlilsized body that would likely be true the goat stopped at the edge its little tail flicked then with no visible hesitation it jumped i bleated aloud as it vanished into empty air a heartbeat later it hit the next ledge down hooves clattering body compressing like a spring it slid regained balance and trotted away as if nothing had happened iwhat my tail was locked straight how did that not kill it bernard chuckled the sound fizzing against my nerves like safe static because theyre small he said simply their bones and muscles are scaled for their weight in very simple terms the forces involved in a fall like that are much less catastrophic when your body isnt carrying as much mass and is specifically designed to deal with it gravity doesnt care about intentions but it does care about numbers another goat shouldered its herdmate playfully this one went over the edge backwards sandi yelped kailo swore something deeply unrepeatable the unlucky ungulate flailed for a moment twisted in the air hit the same lower ledge with a graceless thud then staggered up and headbutted its aggressor when it hopped down to check on it theyre not indestructible bernard said amusement dancing at the edge of his calm they do break legs they do misjudge but their world never produced bodies your size the cliffs they live on feel different to them than they would to you to us a fall of a few times our own height is survivablepainful but survivable to you that same distance can be fatal he glanced up at the hall expression carefully neutral i would not recommend trying this at home tolim snorted outright you heard the man he called no cliffjumping in the dormitories i balked is that what you meant humans jump off cliffs like that for entertainment bernard let out a low belly laugh i feel compelled to note that while thats not inaccurate it ignores the need for specific equipment such as safety lines wingsuits or even parachutes thats insane kailo muttered looking a bit uneasy it shouldnt be much of an issue here on venlil prime the full civilian exchange will be arriving in a few weeks but even if a few of them end up being thrill seekers attempting to base jump in this higher gravity could prove complicated tolims tail swished side to side im just glad a different admin team is handling that i certainly wouldnt want to keep track of a whole herd of excitable humans trying to jump from balcony to balcony the room rippled with laughter even kailos tail gave a reluctant wag and through it all the humans mood stayed steady quietly pleased proud of his ridiculous gravitybaiting goats proud maybe of our horrorlaced fascination so he said tapping to the next slide weve looked at how storms and cliffs treat small bodies lets finish with something a bit closer to home the image that appeared was a city at night tall buildings rose into the dark their windows glowing in grids of warm yellow streetlights cast puddles of illumination on narrow roads there were no vehicles in frame only the whisper of distant traffic and the hum of air systems at first i saw nothing moving then a shadow slipped out of an alley it was roughly the size of a large rodent longlegged and lean with big ears and a sharp narrow muzzle its paws made no sound on the pavement as it trotted across the cameras field of view head turning toward an overflowing bin a predator tiny but unmistakably so this is an urban fox bernard said and there was that odd fond glow again no fear just a warm steady appreciation a small omnivore that has adapted very well to living alongside humans as you can see its not particularly afraid of our buildings or of our scent the fox reared up placing its forepaws on the bins edge sniffing it seized something in its teethsome kind of wrapped packageand dragged it down to tear open its tail flicked in contentment you let that near your dens kailos voice was incredulous but not outraged on purpose bernard tilted his head we dont invite them in for tea if thats what you mean he said mildly but they rarely threaten us an adult human is large and dangerous from their point of view they take what we leave lying about occasionally raid our waste and in return they help control rodents its a mutually tolerant arrangement but predators near children sandi murmured clearly unsettled isnt that risky we do keep an eye out he replied there are always tradeoffs but in my seventyfour years ive seen far more harm done to them by us than the other way around the fox finished its stolen meal then froze head snapping up a moment later two human figures walked into frame their voices quiet one carried a bag the other gestured animatedly the fox watched them muscles taut the pair passed within a few bodylengths one glanced down said something and pointed the other laughed neither moved toward the animal slowly the foxs stance softened it trotted back to the bin to investigate a new scent what youre seeing bernard said quietly is what happens when you have a species that spends a lot of time around us they learnnot

be very faint at a distance unless the emotion is quite strong or there are a great many humans in one place whatever this is appears to be strongest with direct touchyour own physicians have seen that more clearly than i have the details will keep my students busy for decades and were going to be very cautious about how we study it he smiled then the worry easing in any case the important

doesnt make an animal good or evil he said softly it just changes the tools it has to work with our storms are more dangerous than our foxes our cliffs more lethal than our teeth if you remember nothing else from today remember that a world of small bodies can still be a very big place silence settled over the hall not tense not hostilejust full my pad felt heavy in my paws part of me wanted to argue to cling to the simple schema of bigteethbad smallhoovesgood another part the one that still remembered childhood afternoons poring over field guides wanted to ask him for the full data on storm frequencies in that steppe and whether the goats bone structure had measurable differences in tensile strength kailo broke the quiet first so he said in a tone that wasnt quite snide on your world the sky keeps trying to kill you and the goats seem determined to help a few anxious titters my ears pinned ready for the human to bristle instead bernard laughed a bright delighted sound tinged with genuine mirth that spilled over us like warm water that is one way of phrasing it yes he said wiping at his eye with the back of his hand though i would put it rather more politely in a paper perhaps youd care to help me draft a few ideas kailo kailo sputtered sandi snorted tolim actually wheezed the little human on the podium just smiled eyes crinkling and let his laughterand his

nov 11th 2025china hatches plan to keep us military from getting its rareearth magnets china hatches plan to keep us military from getting its rareearth magnets china has been building its dominance in rareearth minerals since the 1990s doug kanterbloomberg news china plans to ease the flow of rare earths and other restricted materials to the us by designing a system that will exclude companies with ties to the us military while fasttracking export approvals for other firms according to people familiar with the plan the validated enduser system or veu would enable chinese leader xi jinping to follow through on a pledge to president trump to facilitate the export of such materials while ensuring that they dont end up with us military suppliers a core concern for china according to the people familiar with the plan if strictly implemented the system could make importing certain chinese materials more difficult for automotive and aerospace companies that have both civilian and defense clients beijings plan could still change and its licensing system wouldnt be certain until it is implemented the people said chinas ministry of commerce didnt respond to a request for comment rareearth magnets and other restricted materials are used widely in civilian goods such as electric vehicles and passenger jets but are also needed in jet fighters submarines and attack drones the veu mechanism that beijing is considering is modeled on us laws and procedures as is much of beijings exportcontrol architecture under the american version of the veu system which has been active since 2007 certain chinese companies are cleared to buy sensitive goods under a general authorizationessentially a simplified exportapproval mechanisminstead of needing individual licenses for each purchase this makes it easier to import controlled goods such as chemicals or chipmaking equipment but requires companies to put up with us government inspections of their facilities among other steps to verify compliance with the program since april beijing has used restrictions on the export of powerful rareearth magnets to win concessions from the us in the trade war following the oct 30 truce between trump and xi which saw both sides make concessions china has publicly committed to issuing general licenses to ease the flow of controlled materials while trump has said that the issuance of general licenses by beijing will mark the de facto end of export curbs on critical materials beijing appears to be keeping some of the controls in place even as it tries to ease exports for proven civilian uses beijing hasnt made clear which companies will be eligible for general licenses or exactly what benefits such licenses would provide it isnt clear how long veu protections would last under the us system chinese companies that are cleared to receive purchases under the veu sometimes have this clearance taken away which has caused consternation in beijing as a result many companies may continue to decide to seek out alternative sources of controlled products even if they can benefit from chinas veu arrangement in recent months companies in the us and europe have complained of reduced access to rareearth magnets though china has periodically agreed to relax magnet restrictions chinese rareearth magnet exports to the us declined 29 in september from the month before in a sign that curbs continued to affect companies in the weeks leading up to the truce some morning reads with coffee as we wait for another batch of more core assays more ore nov 11th 2025china hatches plan to keep us military from getting its rareearth magnets china plans validated enduser system to regulate rare earth exports amid us trade tensions econotimes china plans validated enduser system to regulate rare earth exports amid us trade tensions source sgt mikki sprenkle public domain via wikimedia commons china is reportedly preparing new measures to control the flow of rare earth elements and other critical materials to the united states according to a report by the wall street journal the initiative aims to create a validated enduser veu system designed to restrict exports to companies linked to the us military while facilitating shipments to civilian firms this policy move underscores beijings strategic leverage in the global rare earth market where china remains the worlds dominant supplier rare earth elements are vital for producing a wide range of products from smartphones and electric vehicles to advanced military technologies and renewable energy equipment the proposed veu system will enable china to identify and approve buyers that qualify for streamlined imports ensuring faster access for nonmilitary enterprises at the same time it will allow beijing to tighten control over firms with both civilian and defense contractspotentially complicating supply chains for us manufacturers reliant on these materials the decision also aligns with chinese president xi jinpings pledge to us president donald trump to resume rare earth exports to the american market signaling a partial easing of trade restrictions however analysts suggest that the system could serve as a tool for china to maintain influence over critical supply chains while appearing cooperative on the international stage in response washington has intensified efforts to diversify its

    "canadian infrastructure done right with a conservative plan those of us who have followed the fiasco of the major projects office are increasingly concerned that the liberals dont actually know what the opportunity is and how to capture it today in canada getting crosscountry initiatives such as pipelines rail powerlines conduits and other infrastructure built requires extensive permitting reviews and approvals from multiple levels of government negotiating a lease or an easement with multiple landowners across jurisdictions through a patchwork of laws makes building crosscountry infrastructure an increasingly impossible task around 2015 calgary energy and pipeline major enbridge invested in excess of 1 billion for permitting for their northern gateway pipeline only for the business case to be undermined by the large tanker ban instituted by the liberal government other examples like tmx pipeline and tc coastal link demonstrate that in building cross country infrastructure project execution costs are regularly outshooting planned budgets by substantial margins to solve this problem we need to think more broadly than pipelines alone to the notion of a comprehensive infrastructure highway consider that a highway has lanes and a car or truck can travel on the lane to their destination with no stop lights or impediments the highway is a fast track whereas inner city roads are the slow track using this analogy the current bespoke permitting process is the slow track and a new 20 lane highway is created for transcanada infrastructure that runs legs through every province and territory it is both a highway in the literal and metaphorical sense there are physical lanes of pipelines conduits and rail freight lines that coexist the plan sounds great but where will the money come from what is the business case and how would such a huge project be executed under my leadership as conservative leader and your prime minister the federal government will convene an industry led task force but there is a key difference from the liberals and their ai task force for example the liberals do not know the difference between technical experts and lobbyists liberal taskforces are almost exclusively a highly narrow cross section of vested interests who are pushing a particular agenda to their own benefit often at the expense of the greater opportunity the taskforce i would convene as your prime minister would strike from the group any lobbyist and instead only include project managers principal engineers and financefund managers secondly this taskforce would be personally chaired by me and also an advisory committee of arms length experts the goal is for this taskforce to arrive at a definition of scope and geography for desired legs of the infrastructure highway from the perspective of major industries and companies to find a set of routes which best cooptimize overall benefit lobbyists advocate in an outsized manner for there interests of a select few whereas this forum will seek to give balanced representation to the crosssection of economic interests and other stakeholders who might have a vested stake both in the upfront business case and in the longer term bigger picture of the value and throughput that could be supported rather than thinking of the infrastructure highway as one large contiguous section we should think of it as legs between different hubs hubs are key points for transportation staging storage and routing which connect inland resources to ocean ports and ocean gateways to international trade rather than a highway that is built all at once the designated routes through a joint negotiation with provinces and first nations become zoned that is to say they arent built yet but all future building in those zones is being restricted to prepare it for a future expropriation buyout and build out some of those zones would have to be immediately operationalized in order for the legislation to take effect this puts the onus on industry and the private sector to use it or lose it in the beginning what will likely be operationalized is oil and gas pipelines as these are the low hanging fruit however the infrastructure highway could also support self piloted rail freight with advanced new rail conveyor systems electricity conduits communications cables as well as a range of gaseous and liquid commodities that can safely live together on different legs such gaseous and liquid commodities could include a helium ammonia ethylene hydrogen or more generally gaseous transport b vegetable oil milk potable water beer wine or more generally food grade liquid or slurry transport c mining sludges or slurries industrial semi liquid transport etc furthermore the autopiloted rail opens up opportunities for hard goods manufacturing outputs solid ores agricultural commodities and other outputs of the canadian economy to reach ocean terminals this gives us an idea that in the beginning the scope inclusion could be quite broad but as we work through we will narrow this scope into an initial feasible scope and the extended scope for the initial feasible scope we would have immediate mous or commitments from prospective tenants tenants are companies that will move their product through the pipeline rail or conduits on a take or pay contract where if they dont use it they have to still pay up likely at least 8 lanes of the 20 lanes will be rail freight so there is a good balance of solid liquid and gas commodities that can be moved together some space will also be allowed for future expansion if needed in the other direction we may also import products materials and parts needed by the canadian economy the infrastructure highway should be thought of as much bigger than just oil and gas even though oil and gas are presently its biggest proponents the additional of self piloted rail would revolutionize conveyance and transport in the eastwest direction structurally changing the equation on the efficiency of canadian infrastructure and dramatically lowering cost of transportation self piloted rail can be operated on a car by car basis by individual proponents and industries who can built specialized cars that are compatible with the basic frame and navigation block for example live lobster or refrigerated fish from the east coast could move at blazing fast speeds using unique cars developed for the fisheries industry to the pacific where it could access premium markets in asia with the aid of specialized transport vessels these could move in container sized shipments or in trains of containers that get autorouted through the rail hubs quebecs cement ore aluminum ingots and other outputs could move east and west at high speeds and low costs of transportation all these ideas are of course subject to further refinement in the course of our discussions with the industry led taskforce which will also include stakeholders from railways who might be interested in owning and operating this corridor along with pipeline companies to form the parent organization to agree on the name of this private landlord and infrastructure operator we will hold a canada wide contest to have submissions from canadians of what they would like to name this company to be ipoed on the tsx we must think beyond the narrow parochial vision of canada pitting one region against another to bring the nation together we must have a larger perspective which accommodates a much bigger opportunity and frames a template in legislation regulation and facilitation that will tremendously aid the wider canadian economy if you elect me as prime minister my promise to canadians is that i will lay this foundation and for decades and centuries this infrastructure will yield massive benefits for canada as we consider the framework skeptics will rightly point out objections from provinces and first nations what is my plan to address this furthermore how will i respond to the concerns of environmentalists and the environmental movement dont hold me to these exact numbers but i will give you a template of how this works 1 provinces and federal government get a royalty based on an agreed upon royalty table per commodity class and infrastructure type typical royalties will be around 1 split 05 with the feds and 05 with the participating provinces 2 first nations will get 10 equity stake with 5 of dividends disbursed exclusively to fns who grant right of way and a further 5 of dividends directly transferred to all registered fns as transfers to individuals the first nations equity stake cannot be sold off and is enshrined in the constitution of the private landlord it is held in trust by the federal government which remits transfers to fns 3 the environment fund will have a 2 equity stake with dividends transferred to an arms length environment organization 4 the infrastructure highway is a private land lord ipoed on the tsx and charges a royalty of 5 once the infrastructure highway is fully operational it will move at least 200 billion of commodities a year for export and maybe 200 billion of imports so on 400 billion of goods total charges are 24 billion in up front revenues in total the feds and provinces would split 4 billion and the landlord would earn 20 billion of which 10 billion would be the net earnings this special landlord could be exempted from both provincial and federal corporate taxes until the investment is paid off therefore all of the 10 billion could be available for distribution to shareholders on the tsx 1 billion would be directly transferred to first nations which is about 500 per general first nations and closer to 5000 a year for fns who are living along the corridor and in some cases even more than that another 200 million would be transferred to the environment fund with a projected profit of 8 billion for the general share holder at around 20x pe an initial investment of 160 billion could be justified now you are thinking that 4 billion between the feds and provinces sounds like a raw deal however we must realize that this 400 billion worth of goods is going to stimulate about 1 trillion worth of economic activity the federal government and provinces will collect closer to 150 billion in earnings when downstream taxation and remittances are accounted for this corridor is the vehicle for earnings by keeping the inertial costs low and giving more back to the other stakeholders federal and provincial government will make money in other areas furthermore the landlord and the provinces and federal government can change their royalty formula both before and after recovery of the initial investment that is to say a lower royalty applies until the infrastructure recoups its investment then a higher royalty might kick in by setting royalties in a granular fashion by infrastructure and commodity type there is more control over the rates tables and lease and royalty rates are subject to renegotiation every 10 years with infrastructure tenants for example one source of tax leakage might be our proposed manufacturing free trade zone if the free trade zone brings in parts and machinery tariff free and then exports it through this subsidized transit to foreign markets there might not be a lot of tax take from the labour and corporate taxes alone proportionate to the value addition therefore outbound shipments of manufacturing free trade outputs may be subject to a higher royalty rate for example 10 and the federal governments portion of that is closer to 5 as opposed to the usual 05 on exports the numbers i have laid out are rough figures independent economists actuaries business and finance personnel will advise me as your prime minister based on good analytics what the numbers should be so we maximize the combination of volume and economic benefits what might be the initial rate tables and how the agreements would be setup to give us flexibility to adjust the numbers to address cases of leakage in the future we would run among other things modeling simulations and go through a range of present or future scenarios to ensure that the agreement would be properly setup we believe that 400 billion is a conservative figure on the higher side the figure may be 1 trillion or more for the throughput of trade this corridor could process becoming a major backbone of the canadian economy my message to first nations and the provinces will be dont slay the goose that lays the golden egg if we take too rich of a take we wont move volumes investors will balk and the idea will fail take a smaller piece of a bigger pie than a big piece of nothing royalty rates will not be hard enshrined but along with regulatory decisions are made by a joint committee of federal provincial and fns delegates who table and vote on proposals and motions similarly a regulatory committee of engineers and technical experts will also have delegates nominated by different stakeholders this guarantees that the mix of interests are having a seat at the table to represent and advocate for their positions to direct the functioning of this collapsed joint regulator which oversees the private infrastructure operator that is to say the government regulates and the private sector operates the environment fund through various initiatives we facilitate will end up with as our goal 15 billion of annual recurring funds without any taxpayer contributions required rather these are all dividend paying equity stakes in various projects of the type i described above for example if i facilitate a foreign joint venture between canada to built a new utility or powerplant a small equity piece be it 1 would be kicked into the environment fund in doing so my commitment to the environmental movement is to build up the environment fund without imposing hard caps on emissions or a one dimensional preoccupation with co2 these funds are directed by arms length naturalists biologists ecologists botanists and similar experts towards execution of high value shovels in the ground environmental projects numbering prospectively in thousands of initiatives annually they could include natural co2 sequestration efforts but have a much broader mandate i believe that we can facilitate this business case without any large federal investments unlike current prime minister carney i wont be spending huge amounts of federal cash however i am earmarking around 50 million for the feasibility study and project plan development which culminates in signing new treaties with first nations and in provinces passing legislation which delegates special authority to this infrastructure highway the private sector will lead the industry task force and observers from the pension funds will help to set the agenda but my job as pm will be to steer the direction to include not just the immediate opportunity but to ensure the greater business value and long term economic opportunity is being cooptimized",

    "portable cooler vs thermoelectric cooler which to choose hey everyone so ive been doing a ton of research on keeping stuff cold when im on the go and i kept running into this question should i get a portable cooler or go with a thermoelectric one i figured id share what i learned since a lot of you are probably wondering the same thing whats the real difference okay so heres the deal a regular portable cooler is basically an insulated box you throw in ice packs or actual ice put your drinks and food in there and hope everything stays cold simple right no batteries no plugs just good oldfashioned insulation doing its thing a thermoelectric cooler is different it actually plugs into your cars 12v outlet or sometimes a regular wall outlet and uses electricity to actively cool stuff down theres a little fan and some tech magic that pulls heat away from the inside pretty cool concept literally when does each one make sense ill be honest with you if youre just going to the beach for the day or having a backyard bbq a traditional portable cooler probably makes more sense theyre cheaper you dont need power and they can keep things cold for a solid 2448 hours if you prep them right but heres where thermoelectric coolers shine road trips camping with your vehicle nearby or if youre living the van life i actually ended up getting one for my truck and its been awesome for longer trips no melting ice to deal with and it keeps running as long as youve got power the downsides you should know traditional coolers need ice which means everything gets wet eventually your sandwiches might get soggy if youre not careful plus youre constantly buying ice which adds up thermoelectric models need power obviously and they dont get stuff as cold as a regular cooler with fresh ice they usually cool about 40 degrees below the outside temperature so if its 90 degrees out youre looking at 50 degrees inside at best still cold but not freezing my recommendation if you want something reliable that plugs in and you dont have to mess with ice anymore check out some quality portable cooler options here i went through a bunch of different models before finding one that actually worked well for most casual users id say start with a basic insulated cooler and see how it fits your lifestyle but if youre doing regular road trips or spending lots of time in your car a thermoelectric portable cooler is honestly worth the investment the price difference isnt even that crazy anymore you can find decent electric coolers for around the same price as premium traditional ones i found mine through this collection and its been solid for six months now bottom line think about how youll actually use it day trips and parties traditional cooler extended travel and vehiclebased adventures go electric both have their place and honestly some people like me end up with both hope this helps you figure out which cooling solution works for your situation let me know if you have questions",

    "railroads dirty boots what if texas really didnt want to become american on march 2nd of 1836 texas was officially freed from mexico though not without heavy pushback from mexican officials and over the course of the next nine years the republic itself thrived the power preying on it however did not the united states felt as though texas was their godgiven right which texans felt incredibly wary of this led to what is known as the cimarron standoff where for forty days united states officials surrounded the cimarron panhandle attempting to provoke texas into a war as they had done with mexico decades ago the texans held their ground however and began politically expanding their influence to the american south and northern mexico the united states while not happy with their position in the loss of texas stood stagnant refusing to purchase any more land and refusing to sign any treaties out of fear of being stretched thin this lasted for six years until 1851 where seemingly out of nowhere texas and mexico launched a joint attack on the territory of what was meant to be known as erisonora and new mexico as well as bits of southern california not only this but hardly a week into the surprise war the american south rebelled forcing the united states into a state of emergency that they had never experienced before after two brutal years the confederacy of dixieland as they were called reached atlantic city texas reached denver and mexico had taken phoenix the united states president stephen douglas seeing that if they continued to try and fight their people and military would be utterly destroyed called for a summit in chicago in which mariano arista president of mexico thomas rusk president of texas and jefferson davis president of dixieland and stephen douglas himself along with several other politicians met up to discuss peace terms after months of backandforth between the four and stillness on still open front lines down south the presidents came up with the only solution everybody could agree on texas keeps its independence but cedes back land in new mexico and colorado in exchange for all of the indian reservations in oklahoma mexico was allowed to lease los angeles out for 99 years and renewal of the lease upon a payment five times larger than the entirety of the leases cost over the duration of the 99 years while the confederate states were allowed to keep slavery legal as long as there was more than a 70 popular vote for its legality and under circumstances that would disallow any situation in which dixieland could ever legally rebel from the united states again which they reluctantly agreed to the only thing that the united states requested was that there be a buffer state in what was known as arizona and new mexico to prevent mexico from being able to launch a fullscale attack on the united states with one continuous militia force they called this the treaty of phoenix but it was the start of americas century of humiliation with them staying on pace industrializationwise with the likes of mexico of whom actually surpassed the americans in industrialization index in 1920 all the way even up until now in 2025 as per the treaty of phoenix a bufferstate was created between the united states and arizona and though many names were passed around eventually erisonora was settled on named after the goddess of discord and the sonora desert within erisonora william lane was elected as first captain the leaders of erisonora are called captains with catherine bender his wife serving as headmaster and with john frmont serving as quarterheadmaster after an expedition to find a path for railroad tracks in the rockies because of lanes connection to frmont and railroads in general the three heads of state began implementing extremely advanced railroads with mexico funding the majority of these railroads and later on john d rockefeller beginning to fund the country itself which they in turn paid him for in interest railroads soon became the main moneymaker of erisonora with phoenix being a key city for transport of oil between texas and the west coast of the united states as well as railroad transportation between los angeles and the eastern seaboard specifically washington dc and new york city in 1908 they were ranked the 1 country in railroad development and continued to innovate inventing the first highspeed railway between yuma and dallas in a joint project between erisonora the united states and texas today erisonora is a popular tourist destination with many historical battlegrounds from the americansouthern war between the united states dixieland texas and mexico contained within itself the railroad tourism industry contributes to almost 13 of their gdp though the oil industry has nearly died there with most vehicles in erisonora being electric after the mode vs raleigh legal battle between highjustices in the erisonoras highest judicial court the ruling court where after four years it was finally resolved that all nonelectric vehicles would gain a 20 tax upon being bought by suppliers of cars not people who bought cars themselves erisonora has also attempted to limit the effects of climate change within their country and erisonorans are often ranked in the top 5 among the most environmentally aware people erisonora has a very diverse range of people with 36 of people being spanish or latin descending 23 being white 12 being african american 9 being native mostly navajo 6 asian and aapi and the other 24 being of assorted racial descent the

    "excellent analysis of vingroup q3 result by sonnie tran google translation source below the fold vingroup q3 revenue declined 38 and things the vietnamese press did not dares to mention vingroup corporation has released its independent business results report for the third quarter of 2025 a report that is even more special and noticeable after vingroup threatened to report to the police and sue more than 68 individuals and organizations for reporting false information according to the truth they wanted people to believe and with the tradition of freedom of the vietnamese press all newspapers reported on the dreamlike numbers profit after tax of more than 7500 billion up 150 over the same period accumulated net revenue of 189600 billion a significant increase compared to 64000 billion in the same period in 2024 accumulated gross profit increased 3 times to 15300 billion vnd or a significantly higher cash balance of over vnd 72000 billion all of this creates the impression that vingroup is doing very well but if we dig deeper into the nature of those numbers we see horrifying numbers such as vingroups gross loss of nearly vnd 7300 billion 156 of the same period net revenue from the real estate segment in the third quarter note 25 was only over vnd 7700 billion which is a decrease of 80 compared to nearly vnd 39000 billion in the same period last year the manufacturing segment mainly vinfast although its revenue reached nearly vnd 17700 billion up 256 the accumulated loss for the first 9 months also increased to a record vnd 49600 billion and this loss does not include financial expenses in the first half of 2025 vinfast lost about vnd 24400 billion so in the third quarter alone the manufacturing segment lost nearly vnd 19200 billion accounting for 44 of the total loss in the first 9 months of the year vinfast the moneyburning machine is getting more costly the groups financial report for the first 9 months of 2025 shows a challenging picture for the manufacturing segment where cost pressure is increasing and seriously eroding business efficiency despite efforts to maintain revenue a deeper analysis of the results of the third quarter compared to the first half of the year shows that the situation is becoming alarming especially when the gross loss in one quarter has officially surpassed the total gross loss of the previous six months in terms of revenue the manufacturing segment generated vnd 17700 billion in the third quarter of 2025 this figure although only half the time compared to the first 6 months of the year has reached 536 of the revenue of the entire h1 period nearly 33000 billion vnd showing that sales activities still maintain a significant scale however this bright spot in revenue was quickly overshadowed by the huge burden of cost of goods sold the most worrying development lies in core operating performance in q3 the cost of production activities skyrocketed to more than 30300 billion vnd the scale of this cost of goods sold is not only large but also shows a serious imbalance when compared to the first half of the year the direct result is that the absolute gross loss in q3 alone reached more than 12600 billion vnd notably this figure is 113 higher than the total gross loss of the entire first 6 months of the year combined nearly 11400 billion vnd this fact is a clear demonstration that the core performance of the manufacturing segment has seriously declined each dollar of revenue generated in q3 is bearing a significantly larger cost of goods sold than the previous period the cost pressure does not stop at gross loss in the first half of the year the manufacturing segment recorded a core loss of more than vnd25300 billion in addition other operating costs also created considerable pressure typically warranty provisions related to electric vehicles and batteries which cost more than vnd4300 billion in the first 6 months of the year signaling a large burden of aftersales costs in the long term thus in just 3 months of q3 the manufacturing segment showed worse performance and was under greater cost pressure the fact that the gross loss of a quarter exceeded that of half a year is a sign that the cost related to goods sold is increasing faster than the growth rate of revenue these huge losses confirm that the manufacturing sector focusing on vinfast is the biggest financial burden for the group requiring compensation from other resources including nonrefundable grants from the groups chairman to continue operating high debt crisis media ignorance to compensate for the lossmaking business vingroup has increased its borrowing at an alarming scale compared to the second quarter of 2025 shortterm debt in the third quarter increased by more than 37 to nearly vnd 168400 billion while longterm debt also increased by a huge 31 equivalent to nearly vnd 48500 billion this is an undeniable sign of increased debt and debt restructuring activities as a result financial expenses in q3 skyrocketed to nearly vnd11800 billion up 56 over the same period of which interest expenses alone were nearly vnd8200 billion accumulated in 9 months interest expenses and bond issuance expenses reached nearly vnd23500 billion due to the sudden increase in debt the de leverage ratio increased sharply from 48 to 57 times exceeding the safety threshold proposed by the government 5 times high leverage is only good when cash flow from business operations cfo is abundant the groups cfo in the first 9 months of the year was nearly vnd78600 billion and in q3 it was slightly more positive than vnd7800 billion however vingroups cash flow structure revealed many worrying points when it concealed a dangerous truth about the quality of cash flow because it was created in the context of core business activities still being original vingroup qu 3 doanh thu gim 38 v nhng iu bo ch vit nam khng dm nhc ti tp on vingroup ra bo co kt qu kinh

    "in defense of the t or more accurately in defense of rail transit ive been seeing a lot of comments on here lately touting the lower estimated operating costs of the east busway as some sort of incontrovertible proof that buses are superior to rail in every possible case and that the region should never again attempt a rail project for any reason while the comparison makes sense in that it mitigates the typical accounting problem of buses relying on and beating up taxpayerfunded public streets though the busway does still rely on public streets at either end of its routes it is still an oversimplification consider the following points 1 the t uses 100 electric vehicles while prt buses still burn fossil fuels your lungs and the climate are subsidizing the busway more than the t have you ever smelled a bus in the street as a pedestrian sure prt could electrify the busway using trolley buses or battery buses but that would require more expensive vehicles and an infrastructure buildout oh and did you know that battery vehicles are heavier and wear out the pavement faster 2 the t does a harder job in terms of routes and alignment the t serves hilly suburban neighborhoods on a tricky alignment with lots of hills and grade crossings with all of that adding maintenance complexity prt recently had to tear out and rebuild a street crossing for the t in mt lebanon so that traffic didnt bottom out as badly on the tracks the east busway uses a relatively flat completely gradeseparated heavy rail alignment in the middle of the city it doesnt have to worry about intersections its stations are spaced further apart the pavement doesnt need to deal with braking forces as much prt doesnt really need to coordinate with penndot or domi to do busway maintenance none of those advantages and disadvantages have to do with the vehicles on the rights of way in fact a huge part of the east busways efficiency comes down to the citys infrastructure layout being a giant f you to the hill district i dont have a source but ive heard that the t literally exists because of how infeasible it was to replace the south hills trolley system with buses you cant fault the technology for being more expensive when its competition literally couldnt do the job can you speaking of which see point 4 3 the t crosses 2 rivers on its own infrastructure no busway does technically just a continuation of point 2 but i feel its important enough to stand on its own 4 the pandemic happened i used to live on the east busway before the pandemic the buses were routinely packed to the doors at rush hour buses would just pass by and refuse to pick me up because they were full this was not an occasional thing it was just the status quo i and presumably hundreds of other riders drove biked walked or took different buses at least some days of the week to avoid dealing with the busier lines on the east busway the busway was failing to meet this demand meanwhile trains are more scalable than buses the t can run 2 or even 3car trains during periods of high demand without needing more drivers maybe today the busway is rightsized and the t is overbuilt but before the pandemic the t was the right size and the busway was trying and failing to do a trains job 5 the t is a hodgepodge mishmash of legacy systems and cant be taken as representative of light rail in general for one thing serving 3 fundamentally different types of stations means that your rail vehicle needs extra doors that need extra maintenance and why havent they eliminated the 2 stops 200 feet from each other yet 6 sometimes you get what you pay for the ts manned fare booths and high platform stations are expensive but they serve a purpose they improve accessibility for wheelchairs bicycles and strollers and they allow a large number of passengers to board at once without holding up the vehicle buses get stuck waiting when more than 2 or 3 passengers get on at once the t is also quieter roomier and has more space inside for stuff like wheelchairs and strollers though it could still be way better in this regard this is not theoretical i routinely make tbike trips that i couldnt make on the bus because the bike i use for carrying kids cant fit on the bus racks maybe the t should charge a higher fare for this relative luxury compared to buses but beware the mba business consultant enshitification philosophy of cheaper better 7 the t could theoretically be improved not so sure about the busway standardize the platforms get rid of the redundant station in beechview downsize the overbuilt parkandride lots in castle shannon x2 and dormont to build transitoriented housing delete the lowplatform doors and rearrange the seats to make even more room for wheelchairs and bikes work with municipalities to reduce conflicts with motor vehicles and reorient main streets in the south hills toward transit like they used to be i could probably go deeper into the weeds regarding the relationship between the t and the stadiums and maybe an acknowledgement that individual sections of the t are perhaps more different from each other than the individual busways are but i think ive covered all of the major points maybe the t would still lose the comparison at the end of the day but the current discourse isnt doing the situation justice tldr the t has its issues but comparing one of the best busways in the country which benefits from a clutch urban rail alignment to an old frankenstein rail line that serves scattered hilltop suburbs is not a fair comparison especially if you ignore externalities and yes reducing emissions and providing more than the bare minimum of accessibility costs money",

    "an electric vehicle ev is a motor vehicle whose propulsion is powered fully or mostly by electricity evs encompass a wide range of transportation modes including road and rail vehicles electric boats and submersibles electric aircraft and electric spacecraft early electric vehicles first came into existence in the late 19th century when the second industrial revolution brought forth electrification and mass utilization of dc and ac electric motors using electricity was among the preferred methods for motor vehicle propulsion as it provided a level of quietness comfort and ease of operation that could not be achieved by the gasoline engine cars of the time but range anxiety due to the limited energy storage offered by contemporary battery technologies hindered any mass adoption of private electric vehicles throughout the 20th century internal combustion engines both gasoline and diesel engines were the dominant propulsion mechanisms for cars and trucks for about 100 years but electricitypowered locomotion remained commonplace in other vehicle types such as overhead linepowered mass transit vehicles like electric trains trams monorails and trolley buses as well as various small lowspeed shortrange batterypowered personal vehicles such as mobility scooters plugin hybrid electric vehicles use electric motors as the primary propulsion method rather than as a supplement and did not see any mass production until the late 2000s and battery electric cars did not become practical options for the consumer market until the 2010s progress in batteries electric motors and power electronics has made electric cars more feasible than during the 20th century as a means of reducing tailpipe emissions of carbon dioxide and other pollutants and to reduce the use of fossil fuels government incentives are available in many areas to promote the adoption of electric cars history electric motive power started in 1827 when hungarian priest nyos jedlik built the first rudimentary yet functional electric motor the next year he used it to power a small model car in 1835 professor sibrandus stratingh of the university of groningen in the netherlands built a miniature electric vehicle car and sometime between 1832 and 1839 robert anderson of scotland invented the first crude electric carriage powered by nonrechargeable primary cells american blacksmith and inventor thomas davenport built a toy electric locomotive powered by a primitive electric motor in 1835 in 1838 a scotsman named robert davidson built an electric locomotive that attained a speed of four miles per hour 6 kmh in england a patent was granted in 1840 for the use of rails as conductors of electric current and similar american patents were issued to lilley and colten in 1847 the first massproduced electric vehicles appeared in america in the early 1900s in 1902 the studebaker automobile company entered the automotive business with electric vehicles though it also entered the gasoline vehicles market in 1904 however with the advent of cheap assembly line cars by ford motor company the popularity of electric cars declined significantly due to a lack of electricity grids and the limitations of storage batteries at that time electric cars did not gain much popularity however electric trains gained immense popularity due to their economies and achievable speeds by the 20th century electric rail transport became commonplace due to advances in the development of electric locomotives over time the generalpurpose commercial use of electric cars was reduced to specialist roles as platform trucks forklift trucks ambulances tow tractors and urban delivery vehicles such as the iconic british milk float for most of the 20th century the uk was the worlds largest user of electric road vehicles electrified trains were used for coal transport as the motors did not use the valuable oxygen in the mines switzerlands lack of natural fossil resources forced the rapid electrification of their rail network one of the earliest rechargeable batteries the nickeliron battery was favored by edison for use in electric cars evs were among the earliest automobiles and before the preeminence of light powerful internal combustion engines ices electric automobiles held many vehicle land speed and distance records in the early 1900s they were produced by baker electric columbia electric detroit electric and others and at one point in history outsold gasolinepowered vehicles in 1900 28 percent of the cars on the road in the us were electric evs were so popular that even president woodrow wilson and his secret service agents toured washington dc in their milburn electrics which covered 6070 miles 100110 km per charge most producers of passenger cars opted for gasoline cars in the first decade of the 20th century but electric trucks were an established niche well into the 1920s several developments contributed to a decline in the popularity of electric cars improved road infrastructure required a greater range than that offered by electric cars and the discovery of large reserves of petroleum in texas oklahoma and california led to the wide availability of affordable gasolinepetrol making internal combustion powered cars cheaper to operate over long distances electric vehicles were seldom marketed as womens luxury car which may have been a stigma among male consumers also internal combustionpowered cars became evereasier to operate thanks to the invention of the electric starter by charles kettering in 1912 which eliminated the need of a hand crank for starting a gasoline engine and the noise emitted by ice cars became more bearable thanks to the use of the muffler which hiram percy maxim had invented in 1897 as roads were improved outside urban areas the electric vehicle range could not compete with the ice finally the initiation of mass production of gasolinepowered vehicles by henry ford in 1913 significantly reduced the cost of gasoline cars as compared to electric cars in the 1930s national city lines which was a partnership of general motors firestone and standard oil of california purchased many electric tram networks across the country to dismantle them and replace them with gm buses the partnership was convicted of conspiring to monopolize the sale of equipment and supplies to their subsidiary companies still it was acquitted of conspiring to monopolize the provision of transportation services the copenhagen summit conducted amid a severe observable climate change brought on by humanmade greenhouse gas emissions was held in 2009 during the summit more than 70 countries developed plans to reach net zero eventually for many countries adopting more evs will help reduce the use of gasoline in recent years the market for electric offroad motorcycles including dirt bikes has seen significant growth this trend is driven by advancements in battery technology and increasing demand for recreational electric vehicles experimentation in january 1990 general motors president introduced its ev concept twoseater the impact at the los angeles auto show that september the california air resources board mandated majorautomaker sales of evs in phases starting in 1998 from 1996 to 1998 gm produced 1117 ev1s 800 of which were made available through threeyear leases chrysler ford gm honda and toyota also produced limited numbers of evs for california drivers during this period in 2003 upon the expiration of gms ev1 leases gm discontinued them the discontinuation has variously been attributed to the auto industrys successful federal court challenge to californias zeroemissions vehicle mandate a federal regulation requiring gm to produce and maintain spare parts for the few thousand ev1s and the success of the oil and auto industries media campaign to reduce public acceptance of evs a movie made on the subject in 20052006 was titled who killed the electric car and released theatrically by sony pictures classics in 2006 the film explores the roles of automobile manufacturers oil industry the us government batteries hydrogen vehicles and the general public and each of their roles in limiting the deployment and adoption of this technology ford released a number of their ford ecostar delivery vans into the market honda nissan and toyota also repossessed and crushed most of their evs which like the gm ev1s had been available only by closedend lease after public protests toyota sold 200 of its rav4 evs they later sold at over their original fortythousanddollar price later bmw of canada sold off a number of mini evs when their canadian testing ended the production of the citron berlingo electrique stopped in september 2005 zenn started production in 2006 but ended by 2009 reintroduction during the late 20th and early 21st century the environmental impact of the petroleumbased transportation infrastructure along with the fear of peak oil led to renewed interest in electric transportation infrastructure evs differ from fossil fuelpowered vehicles in that the electricity they consume can be generated from a wide range of sources including fossil fuels nuclear power and renewables such as solar power and wind power or any combination of those recent advancements in battery technology and charging infrastructure have addressed many of the earlier barriers to ev adoption making electric vehicles a more viable option for a wider range of consumers the carbon footprint and other emissions of electric vehicles vary depending on the fuel and technology used for electricity generation the electricity may be stored in the vehicle using a battery flywheel or supercapacitors vehicles using internal combustion engines usually only derive their energy from a single or a few sources usually nonrenewable fossil fuels a key advantage of electric vehicles is regenerative braking which recovers kinetic energy typically lost during friction braking as heat as electricity restored to the onboard battery according to the international energy agencys global ev outlook 2024 more than 14 million new electric cars were sold worldwide in 2023 representing around 18 of total car sales for the year electricity sources evs are much more efficient than fossil fuel vehicles and have few direct emissions at the same time they do rely on electrical energy that is generally provided by a combination of nonfossil fuel plants and fossil fuel plants there are many ways to generate electricity of varying costs efficiency and ecological desirability evs can be made less polluting overall by modifying the source of electricity in some areas persons can ask utilities to provide their electricity from renewable energy therefore it gives the greatest degree of energy resilience connection to generator plants direct connection to electric grids as is common among electric trains trams trolleybuses and trolleytrucks see also overhead lines third rail and conduit current collection online electric vehicle collects power from electric power strips buried under the road surface through electromagnetic induction onboard generators and hybrid evs generated onboard using a diesel engine dieselelectric locomotive and dieselelectric multiple unit demu generated onboard using a fuel cell fuel cell vehicle generated onboard using nuclear energy nuclear submarines and aircraft carriers renewable sources such as solar power solar vehicle it is also possible to have hybrid evs that derive electricity from multiple sources such as onboard rechargeable electricity storage system ress and a direct continuous connection to landbased generation plants for purposes of onhighway recharging with unrestricted highway range onboard rechargeable electricity storage system and a fueled propulsion power source internal combustion engine plugin hybrid for especially large evs such as submarines the chemical energy of the dieselelectric can be replaced by a nuclear reactor the nuclear reactor usually provides heat which drives a steam turbine which drives a generator which is then fed to the propulsion see nuclear marine propulsion a few experimental vehicles such as some cars and a handful of aircraft use solar panels for electricity onboard storage these systems are powered from an external generator plant nearly always when stationary and then disconnected before motion occurs and the electricity is stored in the vehicle until needed full electric vehicles fev power storage methods include chemical energy stored on the vehicle in onboard batteries battery electric vehicle bev typically with a lithiumion battery kinetic energy storage flywheels static energy stored on the vehicle in onboard electric doublelayer capacitors batteries electric doublelayer capacitors and flywheel energy storage are forms of rechargeable onboard electricity storage systems by avoiding an intermediate mechanical step the energy conversion efficiency can be improved compared to hybrids by avoiding unnecessary energy conversions furthermore electrochemical batteries conversions are reversible allowing electrical energy to be stored in chemical form components the type of battery the type of traction motor and the motor controller design vary according to the size power and proposed application which can be as small as a motorized shopping cart or wheelchair through pedelecs electric motorcycles and scooters neighborhood electric vehicles industrial forklift trucks and including many hybrid vehicles battery an electricvehicle battery evb in addition to the traction battery specialty systems used for industrial or recreational vehicles are batteries used to power the propulsion system of a battery electric vehicle bevs these batteries are usually a secondary rechargeable battery and are typically lithiumion batteries traction batteries specifically designed with a high amperehour capacity are used in forklifts electric golf carts riding floor scrubbers electric motorcycles electric cars trucks vans and other electric vehicles lithiumion battery since their first commercial release in 1991 lithiumion batteries have become an important technology for achieving lowcarbon transportation systems most electric vehicles use lithiumion batteries liions or libs lithiumion batteries have a higher energy density longer life span and higher power density than most other practical batteries complicating factors include safety durability thermal breakdown environmental impact and cost liion batteries should be used within safe temperature and voltage ranges to operate safely and efficiently increasing the batterys lifespan decreases effective costs and environmental impact one technique is to operate a subset of the battery cells at a time and switching these subsets in the past nickelmetal hydride batteries were used in some electric cars such as those made by general motors these battery types are considered outdated due to their tendencies to selfdischarge in the heat furthermore a patent for this type of battery was held by chevron which created a problem for their widespread development these factors coupled with their high cost has led to lithiumion batteries leading as the predominant battery for evs the prices of lithiumion batteries have declined dramatically over the past decade contributing to a reduction in price for electric vehicles but an increase in the price of critical minerals such as lithium from 2021 to the end of 2022 has put pressure on historical battery price decreases electric motor the power of a vehicles electric motor as in other machines is measured in kilowatts kw electric motors can deliver their maximum torque over a wide rpm range this means that the performance of a vehicle with a 100 kw electric motor exceeds that of a vehicle with a 100 kw internal combustion engine which can only deliver its maximum torque within a limited range of engine speed efficiency of charging varies considerably depending on the type of charger and energy is lost during the process of converting the electrical energy to mechanical energy usually direct current dc electricity is fed into a dcac inverter where it is converted to alternating current ac electricity and this ac electricity is connected to a 3phase ac motor for electric trains forklift trucks and some electric cars dc motors are often used in some cases universal motors are used and then ac or dc may be employed in recent production vehicles various motor types have been implemented for instance induction motors within tesla motor vehicles and permanent magnet machines in the nissan leaf and chevrolet bolt energy and motors electric motors are mechanically very simple and often achieve 90 energy conversion efficiency over the full range of speeds and power output and can be precisely controlled motion is provided by a rotary electric motor however it is possible to unroll the motor to drive directly against a special matched track these linear motors are used in maglev trains which float above the rails supported by magnetic levitation this allows for almost no rolling resistance of the vehicle and no mechanical wear and tear of the train or track in addition to the highperformance control systems needed switching and curving of the tracks becomes difficult with linear motors which to date has restricted their operations to highspeed point to point services electric traction allows the use of regenerative braking in which the motors are used as brakes and become generators that transform the motion of usually a train into electrical power that is then fed back into the lines this system is particularly advantageous in mountainous operations as descending vehicles can produce a large portion of the power required for those ascending and in startandstop city use this regenerative system is only viable if the system is large enough to use the power generated by descending vehicles they can be finely controlled and provide high torque from stationarytomoving unlike internal combustion engines and do not need multiple gears to match power curves this removes the need for gearboxes and torque converters evs provide quiet and smooth operation and consequently have less noise and vibration than internal combustion engines while this is a desirable attribute it has also evoked concern that the absence of the usual sounds of an approaching vehicle poses a danger to blind elderly and very young pedestrians to mitigate this situation many countries mandate warning sounds when evs are moving slowly up to a speed when normal motion and rotation road suspension electric motor etc noises become audible electric motors do not require oxygen unlike internal combustion engines this is useful for submarines and for space rovers vehicle types it is generally possible to equip any kind of vehicle with an electric powertrain ground vehicles pureelectric vehicles a pureelectric vehicle or allelectric vehicle is powered exclusively through electric motors the electricity may come from a battery battery electric vehicle solar panel solar vehicle or fuel cell fuel cell vehicle hybrid evs there are different ways that a hybrid electric vehicle can combine the power from an electric motor and the internal combustion engine the most common type is a parallel hybrid that connects the engine and the electric motor to the wheels through mechanical coupling in this scenario the electric motor and the engine can drive the wheels directly series hybrids only use the electric motor to drive the wheels and",
