    "from 2026 in the uk and eu crypto is going to as centralised and regulated if not more than traditional banks looking at the new regulations due to come into effect in january 2026 if you value your privacy youd want to be removing your coins from exchanges and putting them in cold storage tldr under dac 8 and carf aligned frameworks eu jurisdictions will require cryptoasset service providers to disclose user data along with their transaction data to tax authorities the eu approach means these obligations will be not just domestic but crossborder service providers in one jurisdiction may have to report for users resident elsewhere the rules specifically state any user data and any transaction data to competent authorities basically the difference from then and now is if the competent authorities want your information and data they need a court order or warrant but from 2026 on they need absolutely nothing in fact they dont even have to request it the exchange will automatically provide it to them the pros it should reduce the amount of scams money laundering criminality associated with crypto carried out by criminals in the eu following the money will be a lot easier for the authorities in an investigation although id imagine tax is their main motive with these new rules the cons your privacy is totally wiped once your coins are bought sold moved the government will know all about it yes there is always p2p but if its facilitated through any 3rd party business which most are its no longer anonymous i dont do anything illegal and pay my taxes but i do value my privacy i dont like the idea of people knowing exactly what and when i buy and sell",

of all id like to remind you that if you really want to do your part for monero one of the simplest ways is to get in touch with your merchantservice provider and request for it to accept monero directly as payment ask the service provider to visit the official website and our communication channels if he or she needs help with system integration that being said the community has been recommending two services in particular changenow and sideshiftai these services are only recommendations which change over time and are operated by entities outside the control of the monero project dyor and be diligent how do i mine monero and other mining questions the correct place to ask questions and discuss the monero mining scene is in the dedicated subreddit rmoneromining that being said you can find a list of pools and available mining software in the getmoneroorg website 2 wallet cli gui why i cant see my balance where is my xmr before any action there are two things to check 1 are you using the latest available version of the wallet a new version is released roughly every 6 months so make sure youre using the current release compare the release on getmoneroorg with your wallets version on settings under debug info 2 is your wallet fully synchronized if it isnt wait the sync to complete because monero is different from bitcoin wallet synchronization is not instant the software needs to synchronize the blockchain and use your private keys to identify your transactions check in the lower left corner gui if the wallet is synchronized you cant send transactions and your balance might be wrong or unavailable if the wallet is not synced with the network so please wait if this is not a sufficient answer for your case and youre looking for more information please see this answer on stackexchange how do i upgrade my wallet to the newest version this question is beautifully answered on stackexchange why does it take so long to sync the wallet for the first time you have decided to use moneros wallet and run a local node congratulations you have chosen the safest and most secure option for your privacy but unfortunately this has an initial cost the first reason for the slowness is that you will need to download the entire blockchain which is considerably heavy 70 gb and constantly growing there are technologies being implemented in monero to slow this growth however it is inevitable to make this initial download to run a full node consider syncing to a device that has an ssd instead of an hdd as this greatly impacts the speed of synchronization now that the blockchain is on your computer the next time you run the wallet you only need to download new blocks which should take seconds or minutes depending on how often you use the wallet i dont want to download the blockchain how can i skip that the way to skip downloading the blockchain is connecting your wallet to a public remote node you can follow this guide on how to set it up you can find a list of public remote nodes on moneroworld be advised that when using a public remote node you lose some of your privacy a public remote node is able to identify your ip and opens up a range for certain attacks that further diminish your privacy a remote node cant see your balance and it cant spend your xmr how do i restore my wallet from the mnemonic seed or from the keys to restore your

    "how masterminds built a 26 billion crime network that nobody can stop 17yearold jordan demay was having the conversation of his life it was march 2022 a beautiful girl had started messaging him on instagram she was interested flirty she wanted to see him and jordan like any teenage boy who suddenly finds himself the centre of attention from someone attractive was thrilled they talked for hours she sent photos he sent photos back it was normal teenage stuff except the girl wasnt real the photos were stolen from someones social media and the person on the other end of those messages was a 24yearold man named samuel ogoshi sitting in nigeria running what he and his brother called a business within hours of sending those photos jordan received a message that changed everything pay me 1000 or i send these pictures to everyone you know your family your school everyone jordan panicked he didnt have 1000 he tried to explain he begged he told them he was thinking about killing himself and samuel ogoshi the man whod spent hours pretending to be a teenage girl whod manipulated jordan into trust who was now extorting him typed back good do it ill wait six hours later jordan demay shot himself in the head samuel and his brother samson had been running this scam on over 100 victims eleven of them were minors jordan was the one who couldnt take it anymore the ogoshi brothers were eventually caught extradited from nigeria and sentenced to 175 years in us federal prison we all though justice served right except heres what nobody wants to talk about the ogoshi brothers werent masterminds they were foot soldiers entrylevel operators in a massive sophisticated criminal network that spans 50 countries generates an estimated 26 billion per year and has been operating with increasing sophistication for over two decades and the people who designed this system who created the scripts the ogoshi brothers used who trained them who launder the billions who coordinate operations across continents are completely invisible this is the story of the most successful unsolved crime of the 21st century and its still happening right now lets go back to where this really started before we can understand how this criminal empire works we need to understand something critical this is not a new scam that suddenly appeared this is an evolution a deliberate strategic evolution from something you probably remember the nigerian prince emails remember those dear sirmadam i am prince whoever from nigeria and i have 25 million trapped in a bank account if you help me transfer it i will give you 10 everyone laughed at those emails they became a joke who would fall for that people asked and the writing was terrible the stories were absurd and the whole thing seemed obviously fake but heres what most people missed those emails worked not on everyone not even on most people but on enough people the fbi estimated that nigerian 419 scams named after the nigerian criminal code section generated hundreds of millions of dollars annually throughout the 1990s and early 2000s the scammers running those operations learned something valuable western people with money could be manipulated into sending cash if you pushed the right psychological buttons greed worked but greed had limits people got suspicious they told friends they reported to authorities so around the mid2000s as online dating platforms exploded and social media made it easy to create fake identities someone and we still dont know who had a brilliant terrible idea what if instead of targeting peoples greed we targeted their loneliness what if instead of promising them money we promised them love what if we spent weeks or months building emotional connections before asking for anything what if we made them fall in love with us first so that when we finally asked for money theyd want to help that innovation targeting emotional vulnerability instead of financial greed created the romance scam industry and it changed everything the architecture of emotional destruction let me show you how sophisticated this has become there are warehouses in nigeria they call them hustle kingdoms or yahoo schools where this is taught as a profession not like a criminal operation like a trade school like youd learn carpentry or plumbing these facilities have computer labs with 2050 stations highspeed internet training materials and standardized scripts instructors called ogas who teach manipulation techniques room and board for trainees young men usually 1825 years old from regions with 40 youth unemployment enroll in these schools they pay no tuition fee upfront instead they agree to give 2040 of everything they steal to the oga until theyve paid back their training costs after that they pay 1030 forever the oga provides everything scripts for different victim types widows divorcees single mothers elderly men stolen photos from real peoples social media accounts fake identity templates instructions on cryptocurrency and money laundering psychological manipulation techniques software tools for managing multiple victims simultaneously and there is one thing that should terrify you these scripts are incredibly sophisticated im talking about documents that are thousands of words long containing 3060 sequential exchanges designed to systematically break down a victims skepticism and build emotional dependency these are not improvised these are engineered psychological weapons a typical script includes how to introduce yourself often as military personnel oil rig workers doctors working for ngos professions that explain long absences specific compliments designed to make victims feel valued religious language to establish moral authority god brought us together timed escalation of intimacy when to say i love you when to discuss future plans predetermined responses to common objections why cant we video chat my camera is broken and im deployed overseas escalation protocols for when victims get suspicious exact wording for financial requests and the craziest part is these scripts are publicly available theyre on tiktok youtube telegram scribd people sell premium versions there are entire communities of scammers sharing tips reviewing each others approaches trading stolen photos like baseball cards the threetier invisible pyramid you know what is truly disturbing this is not just random criminals doing random crimes this is an organized hierarchical system with three distinct tiers tier 1 the streetlevel scammers the visible layer these are the guys actually messaging victims young men usually 1830 years old sitting in internet cafes or hustle kingdoms managing 510 fake identities simultaneously theyre the ones having the conversations building the relationships asking for money when they get caught and thousands do get caught every year it makes news nigerian scammer arrested romance fraud ring busted governments celebrate the fbi issues press releases but arresting these guys accomplishes nothing because for every one arrested two more are being trained these are replaceable parts in a machine removing them doesnt damage the machine tier 2 the middle management the operational layer these are the hustle kingdom proprietors guys whove been successfully scamming for 510 years and have accumulated enough wealth to transition from doing the work themselves to teaching others to do it they recruit they train they take their cut a single oga managing 2050 active scammers can make 100000500000 per month over a career were talking 550 million in earnings very very few of these people ever get arrested they operate in communities where this is semiaccepted as legitimate business local police are often paid off theyre insulated from direct contact with victims so evidence linking them to specific crimes is hard to establish tier 3 the architects the invisible layer and then theres the top tier the people we know almost nothing about these are the people who 1 design the psychological manipulation scripts 2 coordinate money laundering networks across multiple countries 3 establish relationships with cryptocurrency exchanges and banking systems 4 make strategic decisions about which victim demographics to target 5 develop new technologies like the deepfake video calls that started appearing in 2022 6 integrate operations with organized crime syndicates we dont know their names we dont know how many there are we dont know where they operate from we know they exist because the system is too sophisticated too coordinated too resilient to be the product of independent operators but theyve designed the system so that they have zero direct contact with victims no evidence trail no witnesses who can identify them theyre insulated by layers of operational separation when police arrest a streetlevel scammer they cant identify the oga who trained them when they arrest an oga they cant identify the architects because hes never met them communication happens through encrypted channels money moves through cryptocurrency identities are compartmentalized its brilliant its terrifying and it works we dont know the masterminds but can we guess i dont think they are sitting somewhere in africa and designing and running a sophisticated game like this whats your guess the numbers that should keep you awake lets talk about scale because i dont think people understand how massive this is romance scams alone cost us victims 1 13 billion in 2022 2 114 billion in 2023 3 median individual loss 4400 4 but many victims lose 50000500000 thats just reported losses in just one country most victims never report because of shame so real losses are probably 23x higher but romance scams are just one product line the same infrastructure and personnel also run business email compromise bec scams cryptocurrency investment fraud sextortion the thing that killed jordan demay gift card scams money laundering operations when you add it all up nigerianbased cybercriminals extract an estimated 26 billion annually worldwide to put that in perspective thats more than the gdp of 50 countries thats more than nikes annual revenue thats a midsized nations economy built entirely on fraud and its growing every year losses increase every year more sophisticated techniques emerge every year more victim demographics get targeted when romance scams evolved into murder around 20202021 something changed the architects of this system realized theyd been leaving money on the table romance scams required weeks or months of building relationships before asking for money thats labourintensive timeconsuming what if there was a faster way enter sextortion the model is brutally simple create fake profile of attractive young woman target teenage boys on instagram snapchat tiktok quickly escalate to sexual conversation convince victim to send explicit photosvideo immediately demand payment or threaten to send content to victims family friends school the timeline collapses from months to hours a scammer can run 1020 simultaneous sextortion attempts in a single day hit rate is lower but volume makes up for it and here is something even darker the perpetrators discovered that teenage boys are extraordinarily vulnerable to this attack because they have no experience recognizing manipulation theyre terrified of social humiliation they dont have money so they panic and borrow from parents or consider suicide theyre ashamed to tell anyone so they suffer alone the numbers are staggering 1 1000 increase in sextortion cases in 18 months 20222023 2 26718 financial sextortion reports in 2023 alone 3 at least 30 documented suicides linked to sextortion since 2021 jordan demay wasnt alone there are many 1 ryan last 17 california 2 royce parkinson 17 australia 3 numerous others whose families are still processing the trauma and heres what makes this especially evil when jordan told the ogoshi brothers he was suicidal they encouraged him do it fast ill wait because they knew that if he killed himself thered be no witness no testimony just a dead teenager and grieving parents who wouldnt understand what happened the money trail that goes nowhere so where does 26 billion go thats the question that haunts investigators because tracking the money should in theory be possible money has to move through financial systems even cryptocurrency leaves traces follow the money find the criminals its simple right except the system is designed to make that impossible heres how it works step 1 victim sends money usually through wire transfers harder to trace cryptocurrency even harder gift cards nearly impossible theyre like cash once used payment apps zelle venmo cash app step 2 money mules scammers recruit money mules often unwitting accomplices who are told theyre helping with business transactions mules receive funds take a small cut and forward the rest this creates separation between scammer and victim step 3 cryptocurrency conversion funds converted to bitcoin ethereum or more obscure cryptocurrencies through exchanges with varying verification requirements one transaction becomes 510 transactions across multiple wallets step 4 international layering crypto moves through wallets in singapore switzerland cayman islands uae bouncing between exchanges with different jurisdictional authorities step 5 cashout finally converted back to local currency through offshore exchanges and withdrawn as cash or transferred to final accounts the sophistication lies in decentralization theres no single chokepoint disrupt one exchange and they route through others arrest one money mule and ten more are recruited seize one wallet and funds are already distributed across 50 others and heres the terrifying part when governments announce big seizures we recovered 3 million in assets it sounds impressive until you realize thats 001 of annual proceeds its a rounding error black axe when crime becomes corporate now let me introduce you to the most sophisticated player in this ecosystem black axe black axe officially the neo black movement of africa started as a college fraternity in nigeria in 1977 but over decades it evolved into something far darker a transnational organized crime syndicate operating in 50 countries with an estimated 30000 members black axe is what happens when romance scam infrastructure meets organized crime sophistication 1 hierarchical structure with defined ranks and roles 2 violent enforcement capability members who cooperate with police or steal from the organization are murdered 3 integrated financial operations with professional money laundering 4 political connections and corruption networks 5 international coordination in apriljuly 2024 interpol ran operation jackal iii specifically targeting black axe and affiliated groups 1 300 arrests across 21 countries 2 3 million in seized assets 3 720 frozen bank accounts does this sound successful except interpols own assessment concluded that black axe remains one of the most prominent west african transnational organized crime syndicates the operation barely dented their capabilities and heres a number that should terrify you canadian authorities identified a single black axelinked money laundering operation that had processed over 5 billion in illicit proceeds one operation five billion dollars and it was only discovered because someone got sloppy how many other 5 billion operations are running that havent been discovered the convictions that dont matter lets talk about the arrests and convictions because this is where the systems genius really shows every year headlines announce 100 scammers arrested romance fraud ring dismantled major cybercrime operation shut down and its true thousands of arrests happen annually convictions follow people go to prison but heres what nobody mentions 96 of convictions are streetlevel perpetrators the guys actually talking to victims the replaceable foot soldiers when researchers analysed 100 convicted cases in nigeria 96 were primary scammers lowest tier 4 were middletier operators 0 were highlevel organizers or architects and of those arrests what happens a 22yearold gets sentenced to 25 years in prison he serves his time when he gets out he goes right back to scamming now with more experience and better connections from meeting other scammers in prison meanwhile while that one guy serves his sentence the hustle kingdom that trained him has recruited and trained 50 more the net effect of law enforcement is negative its like trying to stop a forest fire by arresting individual trees the fbis stunning admission in 2024 an fbi official made a statement that should have been frontpage news but got buried in routine crime coverage weve only successfully indicted three highlevel sextortion masterminds despite the 1000 increase in cases think about that three out of thousands of operations out of tens of thousands of perpetrators out of a 26 billion industry theyve successfully prosecuted three people at the organizational level the ogoshi brothers are two of those three and theyre not even that high up in the hierarchy they were just two guys running a midlevel operation what about the actual architects still invisible the technology now heres where this story takes a turn into genuine science fiction nightmare territory in 2022 scammers started using something new realtime deepfake video calls previously the reason scammers avoided video calls was obvious they couldnt look like the photos theyd been sending theyd make excuses my camera is broken the connection where i am is too slow for video military regulations prohibit video calls but now they can do video calls where their face is completely convincingly fake heres how it works 1 two phones 2 faceswapping app freely available online 3 phone 1 shows the fake face on the call 4 phone 2 captures scammers real face and movements 5 software swaps the faces in realtime the victim sees a beautiful woman or handsome man talking to them expressions matching the voice perfectly looking exactly like the photos except its completely fabricated the person doesnt exist and the technology is getting better exponentially better every month the faceswapping gets more convincing the lag decreases the glitches get fixed within 23 years this technology will be so good that even experts wont be able to reliably detect it youll be able to have hourlong video conversations with someone who looks sounds and moves like a real person except theyre completely fabricated how do you combat that how do you tell someone the person youve been video calling for six months is not real when they can literally see them the jurisdictional nightmare lets talk about why nobody can stop this the fundamental problem is that romance scams are international by design the perpetrator is in nigeria the victim is in california the money goes through accounts in singapore and switzerland before being converted to cryptocurrency and laundered through exchanges in the cayman islands which country has jurisdiction who prosecutes and under what laws to prosecute in the us you need to extradite from nigeria except nigeria and the us have an extradition treaty with massive loopholes nigeria can refuse extradition if 1 the crime is not considered serious enough they have their own problems 2 the evidence doesnt meet their standards 3 the suspect is a nigerian citizen they rarely extradite their own 4 officials are bribed to delaydeny the request and even if you get extradition approved you need cooperation from every country where money passed through each jurisdiction has different evidence standards legal procedures cooperation agreements the corruption enabler but theres another layer to this that makes it even harder corruption in nigeria ghana and other west african countries where these operations flourish cybercrime is often a semiaccepted part of the economy not legally accepted but socially accepted in regions with 40 youth unemployment where formal education is inaccessible and legitimate jobs pay 50month scamming represents one of the few paths to wealth young men who successfully scam can build houses for their families pay for siblings education become respected community members the unanswered questions 1 who designed the original romance scam scripts someone somewhere around 20052008 figured out that emotional manipulation was more powerful than greedbased scams someone wrote the first sophisticated romance scam script someone tested it refined it turned it into a teachable methodology who was that person are they still active did they realize they were creating a blueprint that would destroy thousands of lives and generate billions in losses or was it just a clever innovation they didnt think would scale this large we dont know nobody knows but if you notice the sophistication in the entire design can you guess 2 how much money is actually missing governments have recovered maybe 12 billion total across all years all countries all efforts but annual losses are estimated at 26 billion over 20 years were talking about 300500 billion stolen where is it thats not hidden in a swiss bank account money thats entire nations gdp money thats build cities buy governments fund armies money 3 why arent tech companies doing more facebook instagram snapchat tiktok these platforms are where the scams happen they have ai that can detect copyrighted music in videos uploaded from bedrooms they can identify faces analyze speech patterns track behavior across billions of users but romance scammers and sextortion operations run openly on their platforms using stolen photos that appear in hundreds of fake accounts following predictable patterns that should be trivially easy to detect 4 whats the ultimate endgame this system has been operating and growing for 20 years annual proceeds increase technology improves victim demographics expand the operation becomes more sophisticated whats the longterm trajectory 5 how many people have died we know of at least 30 suicides linked to sextortion we know many elderly victims who lost their life savings suffered health crises from stress we know some victims became suicidal but how many people have actually died directly or indirectly as a result of romance scams suicide heart attacks strokes from financial devastation health problems from stress nobody tracks this nobody counts but given the millions of victims over 20 years the number is probably in the thousands maybe tens of thousands 6 why cant we stop this this is the question that summarizes everything we know how the system works we know approximately where it operates from we know the infrastructure required we know the financial pathways we know the technology used but after 20 years and thousands of arrests the system is bigger than ever is it fundamentally impossible to stop have we reached a point where transnational cybercrime is simply too complex too distributed too adaptive for traditional law enforcement to combat i am just raising these basic question without giving any probable theory like a conspiracy theorist the invisible empire nobodys fighting let me bring this home with a final disturbing thought right now at this exact moment there are probably 1000050000 people sitting at computers in nigeria ghana south africa and other countries actively scamming victims running romance scams on lonely widows extorting teenage boys manipulating people into crypto investment fraud building relationships that will destroy lives and bank accounts and somewhere in offices in homes in places well never see there are the architects the people who designed this system who coordinate it who profit most from it who have elevated fraud to an industrial scale theyve built a 26 billion empire that spans 50 countries employs tens of thousands destroys millions of lives and operates with effective immunity from prosecution theyve weaponized human loneliness and sexual desire as tools of financial extraction theyve created training systems that turn desperate young men into professional manipulators theyve integrated organized crime cryptocurrency ai and deepfake technology into a nightmare fusion of exploitation and we cant stop them we cant even find them they built an empire out of loneliness and shame and theyre winning the question is not whether this system can be stopped its whether anyone is actually trying to stop the right people because right now theyre ghosts and ghosts dont fear arrest warrants",

    "a cryptocurrency colloquially crypto is a digital currency designed to work through a computer network that is not reliant on any central authority such as a government or bank to uphold or maintain it however a type of cryptocurrency called a stablecoin may rely upon government action or legislation to require that a stable value be upheld and maintained individual coin ownership records are stored in a digital ledger or blockchain which is a computerized database that uses a consensus mechanism to secure transaction records control the creation of additional coins and verify the transfer of coin ownership the two most common consensus mechanisms are proof of work and proof of stake despite the name which has come to describe many of the fungible blockchain tokens that have been created cryptocurrencies are not considered to be currencies in the traditional sense and varying legal treatments have been applied to them in various jurisdictions including classification as commodities securities and currencies cryptocurrencies are generally viewed as a distinct asset class in practice the first cryptocurrency was bitcoin which was first released as opensource software in 2009 as of june 2023 there were more than 25000 other cryptocurrencies in the marketplace of which more than 40 had a market capitalization exceeding 1 billion as of april 2025 the cryptocurrency market capitalization was already estimated at 276 trillion history in 1983 american cryptographer david chaum conceived of a type of cryptographic electronic money called ecash later in 1995 he implemented it through digicash an early form of cryptographic electronic payments digicash required user software in order to withdraw notes from a bank and designate specific encrypted keys before they could be sent to a recipient this allowed the digital currency to be untraceable by a third party in 1996 the national security agency published a paper entitled how to make a mint the cryptography of anonymous electronic cash describing a cryptocurrency system the paper was first published in an mit mailing list october 1996 and later april 1997 in the american law review in 1998 wei dai described bmoney an anonymous distributed electronic cash system shortly thereafter nick szabo described bit gold like bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies that would follow it bit gold not to be confused with the later goldbased exchange bitgold was described as an electronic currency system that required users to complete a proof of work function with solutions being cryptographically put together and published in january 2009 bitcoin was created by pseudonymous developer satoshi nakamoto it used sha256 a cryptographic hash function in its proofofwork scheme in april 2011 namecoin was created as an attempt at forming a decentralized dns in october 2011 litecoin was released which used scrypt as its hash function instead of sha256 peercoin created in august 2012 used a hybrid of proofofwork and proofofstake cryptocurrency has undergone several periods of growth and retraction including several bubbles and market crashes such as in 2011 2013201415 20172018 and 20212023 in august 2014 the uk announced its treasury had commissioned a study of cryptocurrencies and what role if any they could play in the uk economy the study was also to report on whether regulation should be considered its final report was published in 2018 and it issued a consultation on cryptoassets and stablecoins in january 2021 in june 2021 el salvador became the first country to accept bitcoin as legal tender after the legislative assembly had voted 6222 to pass a bill submitted by president nayib bukele classifying the cryptocurrency as such in august 2021 cuba followed with resolution 215 to recognize and regulate cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin in september 2021 the government of china the single largest market for cryptocurrency declared all cryptocurrency transactions illegal this completed a crackdown on cryptocurrency that had previously banned the operation of intermediaries and miners within china in september 2022 the worlds second largest cryptocurrency at that time ethereum transitioned its consensus mechanism from proofofwork pow to proofofstake pos in an upgrade process known as the merge according to the ethereum founder the upgrade would cut both ethereums energy use and carbondioxide emissions by 999 on 11 november 2022 ftx trading ltd a cryptocurrency exchange which also operated a crypto hedge fund and had been valued at 18 billion filed for bankruptcy the financial impact of the collapse extended beyond the immediate ftx customer base as reported while at a reuters conference financial industry executives said that regulators must step in to protect crypto investors technology analyst avivah litan commented on the cryptocurrency ecosystem that everythingneeds to improve dramatically in terms of user experience controls safety customer service formal definition according to jan lansky a cryptocurrency is a system that meets six conditions the system does not require a central authority its state is maintained through distributed consensus the system keeps an overview of cryptocurrency units and their ownership the system defines whether new cryptocurrency units can be created if new cryptocurrency units can be created the system defines the circumstances of their origin and how to determine the ownership of these new units ownership of cryptocurrency units can be proved exclusively cryptographically the system allows transactions to be performed in which ownership of the cryptographic units is changed a transaction statement can only be issued by an entity proving the current ownership of these units if two different instructions for changing the ownership of the same cryptographic units are simultaneously entered the system performs at most one of them in march 2018 the word cryptocurrency was added to the merriamwebster dictionary altcoins after the early innovation of bitcoin in 2008 and the early network effect gained by bitcoin tokens cryptocurrencies and other digital assets that were not bitcoin became collectively known during the 2010s as alternative cryptocurrencies or altcoins sometimes the term alt coins was used or disparagingly shitcoins paul vigna of the wall street journal described altcoins in 2020 as alternative versions of bitcoin given its role as the model protocol for cryptocurrency designers a polytechnic university of catalonia thesis in 2021 used a broader description including not only alternative versions of bitcoin but every cryptocurrency other than bitcoin as of early 2020 there were more than 5000 cryptocurrencies altcoins often have underlying differences when compared to bitcoin for example litecoin aims to process a block every 25 minutes rather than bitcoins 10 minutes which allows litecoin to confirm transactions faster than bitcoin another example is ethereum which has smart contract functionality that allows decentralized applications to be run on its blockchain ethereum was the most used blockchain in 2020 according to bloomberg news in 2016 it had the largest following of any altcoin according to the new york times significant market price rallies across multiple altcoin markets are often referred to as an altseason stablecoins stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable level of purchasing power notably these designs are not foolproof as a number of stablecoins have crashed or lost their peg for example on 11 may 2022 terras stablecoin ust fell from 1 to 26 cents the subsequent failure of terraform labs resulted in the loss of nearly 40b invested in the terra and luna coins in september 2022 south korean prosecutors requested the issuance of an interpol red notice against the companys founder do kwon in hong kong the expected regulatory framework for stablecoins in 202324 is being shaped and includes a few considerations memecoins memecoins are a category of cryptocurrencies that originated from internet memes or jokes the most notable example is dogecoin a memecoin featuring the shiba inu dog from the doge meme memecoins are known for extreme volatility for example the recordhigh value for a dogecoin was 73 cents but that had plunged to 13 cents by mid2024 scams are prolific among memecoins physical crypto physical cryptocurrency coins have been made as promotional items and some have become collectibles some of these have a private key embedded in them to access crypto worth a few dollars there have also been attempts to issue bitcoin bank notes the term physical bitcoin is used in the finance industry when investment funds that hold crypto purchased from crypto exchanges put their crypto holdings in a specialised bank called a custodian these physical representations of cryptocurrency do not hold any value by themselves these are only utilized for collectable purposes for example the first incarnation of the bitcoin casascius coins made of silver brass or aluminum sometimes with gold plating or titan bitcoin which in silver or gold versions are sought after by numismatists architecture cryptocurrency is produced by an entire cryptocurrency system collectively at a rate that is defined when the system is created and that is publicly stated in centralized banking and economic systems such as the us federal reserve system corporate boards or governments control the supply of currency in the case of cryptocurrency companies or governments cannot produce new units and have not so far provided backing for other firms banks or corporate entities that hold asset value measured in it the underlying technical system upon which cryptocurrencies are based was created by satoshi nakamoto within a proofofwork system such as bitcoin the safety integrity and balance of ledgers are maintained by a community of mutually distrustful parties referred to as miners miners use their computers to help validate and timestamp transactions adding them to the ledger in accordance with a particular timestamping scheme in a proofofstake blockchain transactions are validated by holders of the associated cryptocurrency sometimes grouped together in stake pools most cryptocurrencies are designed to gradually decrease the production of that currency placing a cap on the total amount of that currency that will ever be in circulation compared with ordinary currencies held by financial institutions or kept as cash on hand cryptocurrencies can be more difficult for seizure by law enforcement blockchain the validity of each cryptocurrencys coins is provided by a blockchain a blockchain is a continuously growing list of records called blocks which are linked and secured using cryptography each block typically contains a hash pointer as a link to a previous block a timestamp and transaction data by design blockchains are inherently resistant to modification of the data a blockchain is an open distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way for use as a distributed ledger a blockchain is typically managed by a peertopeer network collectively adhering to a protocol for validating new blocks once recorded the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all subsequent blocks which requires collusion of the network majority blockchains are secure by design and are an example of a distributed computing system with high byzantine fault tolerance decentralized consensus has therefore been achieved with a blockchain nodes a node is a computer that connects to a cryptocurrency network the node supports the cryptocurrencys network through either relaying transactions validation or hosting a copy of the blockchain in terms of relaying transactions each network computer node has a copy of the blockchain of the cryptocurrency it supports when a transaction is made the node creating the transaction broadcasts details of the transaction using encryption to other nodes throughout the node network so that the transaction and every other transaction is known node owners are either volunteers those hosted by the organization or body responsible for developing the cryptocurrency blockchain network technology or those who are enticed to host a node to receive rewards from hosting the node network timestamping cryptocurrencies use various timestamping schemes to prove the validity of transactions added to the blockchain ledger without the need for a trusted third party the first timestamping scheme invented was the proofofwork scheme the most widely used proofofwork schemes are based on sha256 and scrypt some other hashing algorithms that are used for proofofwork include cryptonote blake sha3 and x11 another method is called the proofofstake scheme proofofstake is a method of securing a cryptocurrency network and achieving distributed consensus through requesting users to show ownership of a certain amount of currency it is different from proofofwork systems that run difficult hashing algorithms to validate electronic transactions the scheme is largely dependent on the coin and there is currently no standard form of it some cryptocurrencies use a combined proofofwork and proofofstake scheme mining on a blockchain mining is the validation of transactions for this effort successful miners obtain new cryptocurrency as a reward the reward decreases transaction fees by creating a complementary incentive to contribute to the processing power of the network the rate of generating hashes which validate any transaction has been increased by the use of specialized hardware such as fpgas and asics running complex hashing algorithms like sha256 and scrypt this arms race for cheaperyetefficient machines has existed since bitcoin was introduced in 2009 mining is measured by hash rate typically in ths a 2023 imf working paper found that crypto mining could generate 450 million tons of co2 emissions by 2027 accounting for 07 percent of global emissions or 12 percent of the world total with more people entering the world of virtual currency generating hashes for validation has become more complex over time forcing miners to invest increasingly large sums of money to improve computing performance consequently the reward for finding a hash has diminished and often does not justify the investment in equipment and cooling facilities to mitigate the heat the equipment produces and the electricity required to run them popular regions for mining include those with inexpensive electricity a cold climate and jurisdictions with clear and conducive regulations by july 2019 bitcoins electricity consumption was estimated to be approximately 7 gigawatts around 02 of the global total or equivalent to the energy consumed nationally by switzerland some miners pool resources sharing their processing power over a network to split the reward equally according to the amount of work they contributed to the probability of finding a block a share is awarded to members of the mining pool who present a valid partial proofofwork as of february 2018 the chinese government has halted trading of virtual currency banned initial coin offerings and shut down mining many chinese miners have since relocated to canada and texas one company is operating data centers for mining operations at canadian oil and gas field sites due to low gas prices in june 2018 hydro quebec proposed to the provincial government to allocate 500 megawatts of power to crypto companies for mining according to a february 2018 report from fortune iceland has become a haven for cryptocurrency miners in part because of its cheap electricity in march 2018 the city of plattsburgh new york put an 18month moratorium on all cryptocurrency mining in an effort to preserve natural resources and the character and direction of the city in 2021 kazakhstan became the secondbiggest cryptocurrency mining country producing 181 of the global exahash rate the country built a compound containing 50000 computers near ekibastuz gpu price rise an increase in cryptocurrency mining increased the demand for graphics cards gpu in 2017 the computing power of gpus makes them wellsuited to generating hashes popular favorites of cryptocurrency miners such as nvidias gtx 1060 and gtx 1070 graphics cards as well as amds rx 570 and rx 580 gpus doubled or tripled in price or were out of stock a gtx 1070 ti which was released at a price of 450 sold for as much as 1100 another popular card the gtx 1060 6 gb model was released at an msrp of 250 and sold for almost 500 rx 570 and rx 580 cards from amd were out of stock for almost a year miners regularly buy up the entire stock of new gpus as soon as they are available nvidia has asked retailers to do what they can when it comes to selling gpus to gamers instead of miners boris bhles pr manager for nvidia in the german region said gamers come first for nvidia mining accelerator chips numerous companies developed dedicated cryptomining accelerator chips capable of priceperformance far higher than that of cpu or gpu mining at one point intel marketed its own brand of crypto accelerator chip named blockscale wallets a cryptocurrency wallet is a means of storing the public and private keys address or seed which can be used to receive or spend the cryptocurrency with the private key it is possible to write in the public ledger effectively spending the associated cryptocurrency with the public key it is possible for others to send currency to the wallet there exist multiple methods of storing keys or seed in a wallet these methods range from using paper wallets which are public private or seed keys written on paper to using hardware wallets which are hardware to store your wallet information to a digital wallet which is a computer with software hosting your wallet information to hosting your wallet using an exchange where cryptocurrency is traded or by storing your wallet information on a digital medium such as plaintext anonymity bitcoin is pseudonymous rather than anonymous the cryptocurrency in a wallet is not tied to a person but rather to one or more specific keys or addresses thereby bitcoin owners are not immediately identifiable but all transactions are publicly available in the blockchain still cryptocurrency exchanges are often required by law to collect the personal information of their users some cryptocurrencies such as monero zerocoin zerocash and cryptonote implement additional measures to increase privacy such as by using zeroknowledge proofs a recent 2020 study presented different attacks on privacy in cryptocurrencies the attacks demonstrated how the anonymity techniques are not sufficient safeguards in order to improve privacy researchers suggested several different ideas including new cryptographic schemes and mechanisms for hiding the ip address of the source economics cryptocurrencies are used primarily outside banking and governmental institutions and are exchanged over the internet block rewards proofofwork cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin offer block rewards incentives for miners there has been an implicit belief that whether miners are paid by block rewards or transaction fees does not affect the security of the blockchain but a study suggests that this may not be the case under certain circumstances the rewards paid to miners increase the supply of the cryptocurrency by making sure that verifying",
