    "daikin thermostat app even worse after switching to skyport hi everyone over the summer i got a new daikin variable speed heat pump installed while the unit itself is terrific and has saved me a ton of money in the warm climate i live in i could pretty easily make the argument that the daikin issued smart thermostat is probably the least dependable iot device in my home the thermostat itself provides a ton of useful data to ha and i love it in that regard but im having a difficult time getting it to stay online in midoctober daikin made the switch from their apps previous host to using skyport at first i was excited about the change because i thought no way it could get worse i was wrong dead wrong it got worse previously after setting a static ip in my old isp router to the thermostat it got a little better maybe one drop a week that required a refresh at the same time daikin was migrating hosts i ended up doing a network overhaul in my home and upgraded to a better router hardware setup and can say with conviction that my home wireless network is absolutely much better than before however if im lucky if i can get the thermostat to stay connected for a day now my thermostat always shows as connected to my ssid but not connected to the daikin cloud which stops everything anyone else going through it or have any workarounds since my unit is a variable speed heat pump im more or less bound to the daikin thermostat to my knowledge there is no other compatible thermostat that would work with my unit thank you",

    "in memory of dr gao yaojie a great woman who fought against aids opposed government secrecy and cared for the weak on december 10 2023 dr gao yaojie a 95yearold chinese aids prevention activist and the whistleblower of the henan hiv epidemic passed away there have been many reports and commentaries about her here i offer some of my own memories and reflections to commemorate this great woman from central china i first heard her name in the early 2000s on the radio during that relatively open period of chinese public opinion even some official media such as china national radio reported on her deeds her courage in resisting a blackbox government and speaking up for the people deeply shocked my young mind and profoundly influenced my values and life choices dr gao was born in shandong province but from the age of twelve until 2009 for about seventy years she studied worked lived and fought in henan province i am also from henan so i regard her as my fellow native therefore i feel an even deeper connection to her and to the bloodplasma aids disaster in henan to which she devoted her entire life during the 1990s and 2000s chinas economy was growing rapidly but after decades of wars and political movements most people still lived in poverty farmers in henan an agricultural province were among the poorest of the poor when i was a child i saw peasants in my hometown toiling in the fields yet barely surviving unable to afford meat for their daily meals lacking spare clothes to change into and often unable to send their children to school despite this farmers still had to pay agricultural taxes and various arbitrary levies bearing a heavy burden corruption was rampant amid poverty and the absence of the rule of law it was in such circumstances that henans blood disaster occurred some local officials colluded with medical institutions encouraging poor farmers to sell their blood to make money the officials and doctors resold the blood for profit taking most of the earnings medical conditions were extremely poor shared bloodcollection and transfusion equipment caused widespread crossinfection of the hiv virus many villagers became infected the spread was worsened by issues such as drug abuse and prostitution some villages like wenlou village in shangcai county later known nationwide through media exposure saw nearly all men women and children infected yet when the epidemic spread the henan local government like other chinese authorities when facing local scandals suppressed information about the infections banned victims from seeking justice and even confined aids patients in socalled aids villages leaving them to die in isolation patients and their families received no basic medical or living support tens of thousands died from illness or suicide and those still alive lived lives worse than death the governments coverup prevented public awareness and understanding of aids hindering prevention and treatment and leading to even wider infection and death most of these victims men women and children from henans rural villages might have died in silence like their fathers who perished in the great famines decades earlier or like their ancestors over the centuries who died from hunger floods droughts and wars on this disasterstricken land they would have been buried in the yellow earth forgotten in both life and death some aids victims especially women were slandered as prostitutes who died of filthy diseases suffering double humiliation discrimination in life and insult after death government officials and medical staff largely turned a blind eye some even profited enormously from the dirty blood trade even the few who had a conscience chose to remain silent at that time dr gao yaojie a physician at a major hospital in henan courageously stood up for the powerless those infected through blood selling induced by government corruption and deception denied basic treatment and stigmatized by society using her medical expertise dr gao informed chinas central government the world health organization and domestic and international media about the severity of the aids epidemic in henan the despair of the patients and their families and orphans and the urgent necessity of open and transparent aids prevention efforts the resistance she faced was immense the authoritarian regime would not allow the spread of information that might damage its image nor would it take responsibility for policies that had driven farmers to sell blood and caused uncontrollable infection dr gao was placed under house arrest threatened harassed and treated unjustly yet she persisted and never stopped speaking out even when her family and friends were forced to distance themselves under pressure she continued to fight alone strictly speaking she was not the only one who spoke out another henan doctor dr wang shuping also exposed the aids epidemic and government negligence and was similarly persecuted but compared with the silent majority dr gao and dr wang were lonely voices dr gaos outcry was eventually heard by more and more people some conscientious individuals in china and abroad began helping her giving her platforms and amplifying her voice members of the media legal circles political dissidents and some international friends played vital roles in supporting her and drawing attention to the aids crisis compared with the henan local governments concealment and suppression chinas relatively more open central government gradually thanks to dr gaos persistence acknowledged the seriousness of the henan aids problem and the dereliction of duty by local authorities it dispatched investigative teams initiated patient relief and began efforts to remove the stigma surrounding aids thenstate councilor and minister of health wu yi made major contributions to hiv prevention and treatment tens of thousands of patients received lifesaving treatment many more learned how to prevent infection and those who had already died found at least some measure of posthumous justice as saving one life is better than building a sevenstoried pagoda the number of lives dr gao saved is beyond counting her contribution to aids prevention in china is immeasurable yet she was never treated kindly by the government even after the authorities admitted the problem she had exposed she remained under surveillance as a stabilitymaintenance target unable to live or work normally after many further ordeals she was finally forced to leave her homeland and go to the united states there are many reports detailing the henan aids crisis dr gaos appeals and the persecution she suffered so i will not repeat them here dr gaos actions embody several of the rarest and most urgently needed qualities in todays china a commitment to truth courage a sense of responsibility and compassion in a social climate filled with selfinterest lies and apathy it is extraordinarily difficult to uphold these basic virtues that should be natural in any normal society dr gao did it she was like a beacon in the darkness bringing a glimmer of hope to a dim and silent world universal silence is the accomplice of evil a righteous person who dares to speak out is more beautiful than an angel more than twenty years have passed since the henan blood disaster yet people across mainland china and in central henan still live with suffering whether it is the covid19 pandemic and lockdowns unfinished housing projects floods and droughts or unequal access to education the people continue to endure torment todays china is plagued by countless problems and urgently needs change tragically however the people remain largely silent the nations politics and policies remain opaque and the media is even more absent than during the blood disaster years faced with injustice most people prefer to sweep the snow only from their own doorsteps clinging to selfinterest particularly the social elites those with status resources and the power to speak show indifference to public affairs and the vulnerable deepening chinas social cynicism and darwinian cruelty it is heartbreaking yet helpless and it further underscores dr gaos greatness a hero is one who stands up in adversity does what others dare not do and speaks for all humankind in great droughts people long for clouds and rain in national crisis for virtuous generals todays china needs heroes like dr gao more than ever beyond heroes what china needs even more is political reform a sound system of democracy and rule of law and better social security only these can bring true national rejuvenation prosperity and happiness to the people yet in the foreseeable future i am pessimistic about chinas prospects for real change or escape from its predicament though dr gao lived in the united states for more than a decade she never forgot her homeland or her people when she arrived in america she was already over eighty yet she tirelessly wrote lectured and met with people from all walks of life devoting herself to raising global awareness of chinas aids crisis and the governments corruption concealment and negligence the hundreds of millions of people in her native central plains region of china have for centuries been humiliated and trampled by rulers and invaders deprived of rights and dignity and often despised by their own compatriots many having suffered such humiliation have sunk into despair living like walking corpses apathetic and submissive but she never despised or abandoned them she never became cynical or hateful toward her country instead she cared deeply for the suffering treating them as her own children in this alone dr gaos virtue towered to the heavens her heart was purer than water and her love for her country and people burned hotter than fire until the final days of her life she continued to think of her homeland in letters to friends she mentioned the aids orphans children who had lost their parents to the epidemic hoping they would be cared for and grow up healthy in her will she asked that her ashes be scattered in the yellow river she never forgot her country or her home dr gaos memoirs recount her extraordinary life through the eras of the republic of chinas founding the japanese invasion the civil war the communist rise to power the great famine the cultural revolution and the reform and opening period through the deng jiang hu and wen years her recollections are precious revealing the truth of histories long buried or distorted whether describing the cultural vibrancy of the republic and the destruction of war or the horrors of the famine and the cultural revolution that scarred millions her stories are vivid and deeply moving her life is a documentary of a century of chinese suffering a living fossil of the spirit of the central plains and a testament to the resilience of chinese women who have endured storms and hardship she is gone but her spirit lives on i am proud that my homeland produced such a heroic woman though i am humbled by my own lack of her courage and depth her deeds and character touched me deeply in childhood and surely moved countless others in china and around the world the soul of dr gao yaojie is immortal her example and her spirit will continue to inspire generations of chinese sons and daughters to fight and sacrifice for the prosperity and progress of their country and the welfare of its people",

short answer yes that is a safe accurate and strategically precise way to frame cop30s most pressing issue and it aligns cleanly with bridge360 metatheory below is a fully grounded explanation through the bridge360 lens giving you a clean articulation you can later reuse in substack or policy briefs why promising weak convergence is the core issue of cop30 across all cop cycles there is a tension between grand declarations highentropy fragile truthattractor style commitments and operational pathways lowentropy navigable slowmoving weak convergence cop30 is the first cop where the gap is so large that only weak convergence is realistically attainable weak convergence here means 1 directional agreement not uniform commitments 2 shared gradients not identical policies 3 entropybounded trajectories not truthclaim targets 4 incremental navigation not sweeping resolutions 5 multiple attractors competing but some emerging as stable enough to coordinate global behavior that is exactly the bridge360 definition of weak convergence at cop30 this is visible in five domains 1 global south financing architecture everyone agrees the current system is broken but no single replacement is feasible weak convergence blended finance local industrial policy risksharing schemes debt swaps 2 methane reductions uniform global caps are impossible national incentives diverge weak convergence

adaptation and resilience metrics universal adaptation targets are incoherent different risks cultures budgets weak convergence a global resilience index trending toward common data ontology bridge360 interpretation in bridge360 language cop30s actual function is to identify the next stable attractors axiom19 entropybounded mapping says truthattractor agreements high fragility high entropy cost weak convergence low entropy high navigability high operational survivability thus this is exactly what you mean by promising weak convergence from which everyone can take cue going forward political interpretation every nation enters cop30 constrained by domestic politics energy security economic recession risks aitransition uncertainty thus strong agreement is politically impossible weak convergence is the only form of global alignment that survives the next 35 years this matches your q4 2026q1 2027 recession forecast when recession risk is high entropy budgets shrink and global governance becomes weakconvergence dominated conclusion for quoting or posting yes the most pressing issue at cop30 is determining the stable weakconvergence pathways that can survive political

    "mdickie game idea the future concept for it coming soon i actually really love this idea and have more ideas for games as we know mdickie said that infinite lives is his final game in 3d and hell likely return to 2d games whether or not they have the same developments as the previous 2d games we dont know but this opens the door for new games and possibilities rather than remastering former games which would put it all into a loop again speaking of loops lets talk about back wars as i previously stated in my mdickie lore theories it causes loads of problems to the timeline that eventually causes the 3d timeline obviously a back wars 3d wouldve been cool after infinite lives but we wont have that maybe a remaster in the new 2d maybe but back wars introduced an element that could be expanded on that is the future most of the community has always wanted a life sim and the future is the perfect way to make it i dont know what the ambition for this game could be maybe similar to extra lives and wrecked where you would have to survive actually this game could just be remastered wrecked and i guess back wars too but only this time you have to survive in the past as somebody from the future to try to get out theres already a handful of characters mdickie can just send from back wars to the future so he doesnt have to work even more for that maybe old characters can return but it wouldnt make sense so it would be even cooler to see their descendants or something we could see even more new futuristic weapons or even upgraded weapons maybe there could be a cool way to go back in time and go to only a couple of locations from the past to meet ancestors maybe killing those ancestors would also kill them in the future maybe with syringes you could even stab somebody from the past and turn them into a zombie causing zombies in the future as well this has loads of potential maybe with another type of syringe you could inject yourself or somebody and give you or them superpowers though not as many superpowers as infinite lives i would say causing the future to turn into a smallerscale yet futuristic version of super city i could see a 2099 parody here also similar to wrecked i could see a few events for example the past vs the future similar to wrecked the tribe from the island attacks the city here i could see the past stumbling into the future and attacking it causing an altercation similar to back wars floods could also happen as well as extreme heat that does damage to you over time causing battles to be genuine fights to survive this could be climate change and the game would have factions including the loners civilians soldiers masters protestors and ai working with soldiers as well if you are caught doing crimes soldiers but more likely ai will find you and take you to the court if you are sentenced to time in prison you will stay in the futuristic prison with other inmates where future weapons are also there you could try to escape and cause even more chaos you can also be sentenced to execution similar to the you testament but you could actually fight back and escape execution causing even more chaos if you went back in time as any faction other than a soldier or ai you will be wanted for trespassing in the past and especially wanted even more if you caused something that causes zombies or superhumans or anything else that changes the future there could also be a feature where you could create your own ai and he would be your sidekick that would help fight against enemies with weapons and a very own superpower of your choice if he dies there will be sad final words from him theres a lot of potential with this idea and it would serve as a good reboot to the mdickie as just like in real life mdickie starts over again with another era of games",

    "us taxpayer dollars fuel covert operation to silence pesticide critics a public relations firm vfluence secretly profiled over 3000 organizations and 500 individuals including environmental health journalists scientists and advocates in an effort to undermine global resistance to pesticides and genetically modified crops the operation was partially funded by the us agency for international development the firm created a private social network called bonus eventus accessible to about 1000 members primarily from the agrochemical industry academia and government agencies serving as a repository for detailed profiles that often included sensitive personal information this scandal is part of a longer history of corporate influence and government collusion in the agricultural sector drawing parallels to the monsanto papers which revealed how the agricultural giant had manipulated science and public opinion to protect its profits following exposure vfluence has shut down the bonus eventus platform but questions remain about the potential misuse of personal information and the impact on those profiled the firm and its leader jay byrne are named as codefendants in a lawsuit against syngenta the manufacturer of paraquat a highly toxic herbicide linked to parkinsons disease environmental and health advocates are calling for a thorough investigation and stricter regulations to prevent such abuses of power in the future emphasizing the ongoing need for vigilance in safeguarding the integrity of scientific research and public discourse in a chilling revelation that echoes cold warera paranoia it has come to light that a public relations firm vfluence secretly profiled over 3000 organizations and 500 individuals including environmental health journalists scientists and advocates in a concerted effort to undermine global resistance to pesticides and genetically modified gm crops the operation funded in part by the us agency for international development usaid has now been shut down following widespread public outcry and media scrutiny the dark side of bonus eventus vfluence led by jay byrne a former communications director at monsanto created a private social network called bonus eventus named after the roman god of agriculture this shadowy platform accessible to about 1000 members primarily from the agrochemical industry academia and government agencies served as a clandestine repository of detailed profiles these profiles often included sensitive personal information such as home addresses phone numbers and even the names and house values of family members its a clear violation of privacy and a fundamental attack on the principles of democratic discourse said arthur grimonpont of reporters without borders this kind of manipulation is designed to silence voices that challenge the status quo and should be condemned in the strongest possible terms a legacy of corporate influence and government collusion the revelation of vfluences activities is not an isolated incident but part of a longer history of corporate influence and government collusion in the agricultural sector in the 1980s and 1990s similar tactics were used by tobacco companies to downplay the health risks of smoking more recently the fossil fuel industry has been accused of funding think tanks and advocacy groups to cast doubt on climate change science the current scandal draws parallels to the monsanto papers a trove of internal documents that revealed how the agricultural giant had manipulated science and public opinion to protect its profits the documents showed that monsanto had ghostwritten scientific papers funded favorable research and attacked critics who raised concerns about the safety of its products particularly the herbicide roundup the people who run vfluence should search their consciences and ask themselves how the organization serves society and humankind said professor michael antoniou a geneticist whose work on the safety of gm crops has been repeatedly targeted their sole purpose seems to be to undermine the honest work of individuals and organizations whose aim is to research and educate about the risks posed by gmos and pesticides the aftermath legal and ethical questions abound following the exposure of vfluences activities by the guardian and other media partners the company has made significant staff cuts and shut down the bonus eventus platform however the damage has already been done and many of those profiled remain concerned about the potential misuse of their personal information those of us who were profiled still do not know who accessed the information and how it was used antoniou added did it hinder us in our careers or close doors that otherwise may have been open to us the fact that vfluence and the industries it serves resorted to these underhanded methods shows that they were unable to win on the level of the science moreover vfluence and byrne are named as codefendants in a lawsuit against syngenta the manufacturer of paraquat a highly toxic herbicide linked to parkinsons disease the lawsuit alleges that vfluence helped syngenta suppress information about the health risks of paraquat and neutralize its critics a call to action the shutdown of vfluences profiling operation is a significant victory for transparency and accountability but the broader issue of corporate influence in policymaking remains a pressing concern environmental and health advocates are calling for a thorough investigation and stricter regulations to prevent such abuses of power in the future the practice of profiling and spreading rumors that could harm journalists integrity should never be allowed to flourish in a democratic state grimonpont emphasized a thorough investigation must be conducted to bring to justice all those involved in these outrageous violations of privacy and the reputation of environmental journalists as the dust settles the vfluence scandal serves as a stark reminder of the ongoing need for vigilance in safeguarding the integrity of scientific research and public discourse the fight against corporate influence and government collusion is far from over and the voices of those advocating for a safer more sustainable future must continue to be heard",

    "we have no hr confused on expectations idk how to navigate this stuff i was given feedback by my manager a month ago to not be so friendly which i dont think im too friendly he thought i was being too personal with people asked me to reflect on my words actions because in a short time period i reported to ethics a racist comment another manager made as well as two associates having relations on the clock both got fired both were managers involved with regular associates im a manager btw he asked how im getting wrapped up into things or why people feel comfortable enough to talk to me about these things i truly dont know people have always told me wild shit since i was young i even set verbal boundaries people just shrug me off i dont know what im doing wrong i want to throw in here i dont reveal anything about my life or personal stuff except for the fact im in college i have cats im on a strict diet due to my weight loss journey i spoke with management about my recent family emergency these are things that have came up during small talk i do not speak or hang out with anyone outside of work i have always kept that boundary because it was apart of my training when i was a store leader with another company i excelled in im naturally investigative i have extreme pattern recognition i know when employees are doing wrong things this doesnt mean i snitch on everyone only when it affects the workflow or my ability to maintain an inclusivesafefair environment however as a manager the last thing i want to do is have half of my team myself work 10x as hard because a manager our associate is smoking weed making out on the clock in a car in the parking lot for an hour last thing i want is for another manager to make a racist comment which leads to one of our associates bursting into tears leaving work early because english isnt her first language she simply dont understand what the manager on duty was requesting of her i explained these things to my manager who gave me this feedback but he still looped me back to people being too comfortable with me idk how its my fault or howwhy i come off that way because he wasnt specific here i am today i had perfect attendance since starting this job in march always a half hour early to greet everyone read emails before jumping in to my tasks in the last 2 weeks ive called off twice was late twice all of a sudden i just feel so stressed out sick after that feedback my manager gave me ive taken it seriously anytime someone comes to me with something that doesnt immediately compromise safety i shut it down very firmly because i take accountability that neurotypicals might see me as being overly friendly idk but this has now led to the team not trusting me treating me with indifference the energy has shifted my mom had a heart attack two weeks ago i begged to leave early to be with her the manager on duty who couldve taken over the keys was an hour late which if she wasnt i couldve left a half an hr early which was good enough for me i called called the other managers long story short i ended up working ot despite my emergency not even a good morning or an apology when they came in either tonight i worked with a girl who is the same management level as me who leaves often because shes tired which i dont care because i know im capable of getting the job done short staffed or not im tired too a lot so i dont blame her because all of us have different thresholds however tonight she told me i could leave early because we were overstaffed i was gracious of this because truly im so worn down i was up 12 hours before going to work which i work 10 hour shifts didnt sleep well the night before due to stress being sick with a sinus infection i was estatic however right after telling me i could leave she suddenly had to leave because our upper manager went to another job site when he clocked out when i came into work got punched at another store he visited ive been picking up on the two of them for weeks they are both married but are likely seeing each other because the girl spills too many hints from my pattern recognition i believe he got into a fight with another associate that was hitting on her however of course i have turned a blind eye to it all trying to respect the feedback from my manager keep my blinders on i dont care try not to let it affect me again i dont care if they are together im scared the bias this dynamic will affect me she is all about drama i feel like i have to agree with her because she is highly emotional ive noticed the few times i didnt agree she changes her entire persona towards me for the rest of shift anyways i texted her asking if she would be back to work just to set my own expectations if i can still leave early or not no reply because she left it in the air then two hours later the manager that apparently got punched called the store to tell me she would be back after dropping him off at the hospital she gets back shes instantly hostile towards me face red wont hardly speak i ask her if everything is okay she ignores me i tell her i dont mind still working she basically pressures me to still leave early everyone else on the clock treats me different as soon as she walked in too no joking or laughing or friendly conversation like usual all except for one girl i feel like this was wildly unprofessional annoying the girl that left also texted me yesterday while i was off the clock about drama but never provided context saying someone was calling for me trying to start shit but wouldnt say why when i asked her this made me anxious all night wondering what i did wrong or who it was someone please give me feedback i feel like this is going to fall back on me again tomorrow anytime i mention problems im treated like im the problem or that im a sensitive flower cant handle stuff i dont care if they have a relationship what i care about is my level of respect how these things impact my job nobody respected me when i had a genuine family emergency im not trying to have a lack of empathy if our manager truly got punched but also hes a grown man starting fights at other stores whos married i dont understand why someone else in his life couldnt have came to his rescue i dont understand why their business needs to impede on my job i dont understand why when i have legitimate reasons to leave im always thrown on the back burner treated different can someone help me out here im sure ill get a talking to tomorrow my stomach hurts so bad she told me i could leave but when i actually left i didnt say anything because she made me feel so uncomfortable due to her hostility so im scared shes going to frame it as i walked out the manager that got punched has a say in my employmentwrite ups ect im so sad because i really like this job too theres just so many emotional components to this its hard to navigate im scared ill get fired because im the odd one out it feels like nobody seems to see things from my perspective at all ive been a store leader at another job before this for 8 years straight mind you im only 24 handling much larger mental loads during my time there however i had greater amounts of support from management my peers where we had a structured way of handling these things it was against policy to have these personal relations or biases towards other employees especially as a higher manager hr would shut it down immediately or consequences ensue at my current job the feedback i received from that manager a month ago was the only feedback ive received at all since starting work in march i just feel stagnant so maybe my brain expects the same thing at my current place of employment i want to fit in so bad besides my poor attendance of this past week im perfect on paper but it feels like im failing if i join the drama my team likes me but my managers dont if i stay out of it my team turns on me i feel like a black sheep some of the managers like me some still dont i guess im seeking validation common experiences even advice if anyone else can share im desperate im so stressed im scared im going to lose my job which i cant afford in this current economical climate but i cant just keep hanging my head low being treated some type of way i feel lost",

leader with another company i excelled in im naturally investigative i have extreme pattern recognition i know when employees are doing wrong things this doesnt mean i snitch on everyone only when it affects the workflow or my ability to maintain an inclusivesafefair environment however as a manager the last thing i want to do is have half of my team myself work 10x as hard because a manager our associate is smoking weed making out on the clock in a car in the parking lot for an hour last thing i want is for another manager to make a racist comment which leads to one of our associates bursting into tears leaving work early because english isnt her first language she simply dont understand what the manager on duty was requesting of her i explained these things to my manager who gave me this feedback but he still looped me back to people being too comfortable with me idk how its my fault or howwhy i come off that way because he wasnt specific here i am today i had perfect attendance since starting this job in march always a half hour early to greet everyone read emails before jumping in to my tasks in the last 2 weeks ive called off twice was late twice all of a sudden i just feel so stressed out sick after that feedback my manager gave me ive taken it seriously anytime someone comes to me with something that doesnt immediately compromise safety i shut it down very firmly because i take accountability that neurotypicals might see me as being overly friendly idk but this has now led to the team not trusting me treating me with indifference the energy has shifted my mom had a heart attack two weeks ago i begged to leave early to be with her the manager on duty who couldve taken over the keys was an hour late which if she wasnt i couldve left a half an hr early which was good enough for me i called called the other managers long story short i ended up working ot despite my emergency not even a good morning or an apology when they came in either tonight i worked with a girl who is the same management level as me who leaves often because shes tired which i dont care because i know im capable of getting the job done short staffed or not im tired too a lot so i dont blame her because all of us have different thresholds however tonight she told me i could leave early because we were overstaffed i was gracious of this because truly im so worn down i was up 12 hours before going to work which i work 10 hour shifts didnt sleep well the night before due to stress being sick with a sinus infection i was estatic however right after telling me i could leave she suddenly had to leave because our upper manager went to another job site when he clocked out when i came into work got punched at another store he visited ive been picking up on the two of them for weeks they are both married but are likely seeing each other because the girl spills too many hints from my pattern recognition i believe he got into a fight with another associate that was hitting on her however of course i have turned a blind eye to it all trying to respect the feedback from my manager keep my blinders on i dont care try not to let it affect me again i dont care if they are together im scared the bias this dynamic will affect me she is all about drama i feel like i have to agree with her because she is highly emotional ive noticed the few times i didnt agree she changes her entire persona towards me for the rest of shift anyways i texted her asking if she would be back to work just to set my own expectations if i can still leave early or not no reply because she left it in the air then two hours later the manager that apparently got punched called the store to tell me she would be back after dropping him off at the hospital she gets back shes instantly hostile towards me face red wont hardly speak i ask her if everything is okay she ignores me i tell her i dont mind still working she basically pressures me to still leave early everyone else on the clock treats me different as soon as she walked in too no joking or laughing or friendly conversation like usual all except for one girl i feel like this was wildly unprofessional annoying the girl that left also texted me yesterday while i was off the clock about drama but never provided context saying someone was calling for me trying to start shit but wouldnt say why when i asked her this made me anxious all night wondering what i did wrong or who it was someone please give me feedback i feel like this is going to fall back on me again tomorrow anytime i mention problems im treated like im the problem or that im a sensitive flower cant handle stuff i dont care if they have a relationship what i care about is my level of respect how these things impact my job nobody respected me when i had a genuine family emergency im not trying to have a lack of empathy if our manager truly got punched but also hes a grown man starting fights at other stores whos married i dont understand why someone else in his life couldnt have came to his rescue i dont understand why their business needs to impede on my job i dont understand why when i have legitimate reasons to leave im always thrown on the back burner treated different can someone help me out here im sure ill get a talking to tomorrow my stomach hurts so bad she told me i could leave but when i actually left i didnt say anything because she made me feel so uncomfortable due to her hostility so im scared shes going to frame it as i walked out the manager that got punched has a say in my employmentwrite ups ect im so sad because i really like this job too theres just so many emotional components to this its hard to navigate im scared ill get fired because im the odd one out it feels like nobody seems to see things from my perspective at all ive been a store leader at another job before this for 8 years straight mind you im only 24 handling much larger mental loads during my time there however i had greater amounts of support from management my peers where we had a structured way of handling these things it was against policy to have these personal relations or biases towards other employees especially as a higher manager hr would shut it down immediately or consequences ensue at my current job the feedback i received from that manager a month ago was the only feedback ive received at all since starting work in march i just feel stagnant so maybe my brain expects the same thing at my current place of employment i want to fit in so bad besides my poor attendance of this past week im perfect on paper but it feels like im failing if i join the drama my team likes me but my managers dont if i stay out of it my team turns on me i feel like a black sheep some of the managers like me some still dont i guess im seeking validation common experiences even advice if anyone else can share im desperate im so stressed im scared im going to lose my job which i cant afford in this current economical climate but i cant just keep hanging my head low being treated some type of way i feel lost",
    "workplace dramaissues not sure how to navigate advice i was given feedback by my manager a month ago to not be so friendly which i dont think im too friendly he thought i was being too personal with people asked me to reflect on my words actions because in a short time period i reported to ethics a racist comment another manager made as well as two associates having relations on the clock both got fired both were managers involved with regular associates im a manager btw he asked how im getting wrapped up into things or why people feel comfortable enough to talk to me about these things i truly dont know people have always told me wild shit since i was young i even set verbal boundaries people just shrug me off i dont know what im doing wrong i want to throw in here i dont

    "we need to talk about youth politics in singapore singapore media dsa bullying jc mergers all schools are good schools mental health well im back with more postsyes even after one yesterday lol yes another one less than 2 weeks after my last one i guess i just feel kinda inspired after some recent events and felt that i needed to let my thoughts out through here haha just a short disclaimer before going forward ill try to be as nonpartisan as possible here given the nature of this post that said im definitely not perfect and some of my biases will definitely be evident here that said ill try my absolute best to stay politically neutral and objective and neither oppose nor endorse any political parties listed tldr youth even in singapore do have the power to inspire political change and change in general if were more politically engaged context this kinda starts all the way back at the start of the year when i came across an ig reel from then new york city assembly member zohran mamdani running for the democratic nomination for city mayor as i continued watching more and more reels from him i realised how much he tried to appeal to younger first time voters by not only advocating for policies popular with youths and first time voters like free bus rides and rent freezes but also stayed relevant with popular reels and online content that attracted such first time voters after that day i followed his story and rise to fame closely from his poll defying win during the primary to his eventual win this wednesday even i personally woke up early that day to watch the election results live and got so happy when he won by 9 points there were so many emotions running through me pride joy elation but at the bottom of it all curiosity according to ap news mamdani performed overwhelmingly with first time voters and young voters younger than 30 have politicians in singapore done the same to appeal to youth voters and could a mamdani type arise here under the right conditions during the next general election youths primary concerns according to ntuc youth the 4 main concerns of youths today here in singapore are 1 financial worries and overall uncertainty 2 mental health online 3 family problems 4 sexual violence a keen eye might notice that the most prominent issues that youths face currently are an increasingly difficult financial landscape and if you observed this years general election the top issue addressed by parties and candidates across the board are cost of living issues thats not to say the rest of these issues can somewhat be helped by government policies as well this goes to show that many of what singaporean youth desire and are concerned about can be addressed and helped with through politicians and thus a government that serves their needs and especially since political awareness and even engagement is on the rise thanks to social media engaging with youths as a voting bloc is becoming more important than ever even though the voting age in singapore is at the high 21 years old so what has been done to engage with students and thus youths as a whole youth politics in singapore first most established political parties in singapore have youth wings of their parties these are basically avenues for these parties to engage with youth voters and allow youths to volunteer with their parties the most prominent examples are the youth pap which regularly engages with youths and younger voters on their most important issues for those more interested in opposition politics theres the sdp young democrats which were recently involved in crafting a policy roadmap to follow for future general elections and the workers party holds the biennial youth conference which aims to bring together youth volunteers and interested youth voters alike secondly even in the most recent general election major parties have made major strides in attempting to appeal to youth and first time voters as mentioned earlier most political candidates during the last general election proposed policies that aimed to alleviate the cost of living crisis which as mentioned was the primary concern of youthand most voters heading to the general election not only that but some political parties even go as far as to propose policies that are directly relevant to students as a whole in singapore the main example of this is the workers party proposal for later school start times to allow students to have more needed sleep why are youth not getting involved firstly is that some youth are simply disinterested in politics think about it how many of the people you know actively debate politics or even kept up with this years election most students do not regularly debate or talk about singaporean politics to each other and its easy to see why with most students and thus youths more concerned for studying for their exams and other hobbies its easy to disregard politics here especially since they have little stake furthermore even attempts to integrate local political awareness to the syllabus such as social studies english and gp overall did not do well to inspire students to research more into politics if anything many view these subjects as a burden given the multiple complaints about the humanities and ss in particular as well as gp secondly some youth feel pressured to not partake in it especially due to the paps electoral dominance the pap has repeatedly dominated every single election since independence even during the 2025 general election the pap gained vote share to 6557 which is a vast increase from their 6124 in 2020 such electoral dominance has various effects namely that youth who prefer opposition policies over those proposed by the establishment may see no purpose in properly engaging with local politics given that the pap is likely to win regardless which is especially true in smcs or grcs which are not held by opposition parties why should the average student get involved well the answer here is extremely simple youth and thus all of us here are the future of this country each and every one of us here has a role to play in singapores future even if it may not seem so now we are responsible for the development and growth of our country we are responsible for taking care of an ever ageing population here and for the guys especially were responsible for the defense of our country as well as such it is imperative that our needs and concerns are addressed by those in power even if we dont have the right to vote just yet yes even if your desired policies are best seen in opposition parties its still important to engage with the established government as well as thats the only way they can be made aware of the issues facing youths here today opinion what should be done to engage more with voters and how can youths engage more one especially those more so engaged in opposition politics might just easily propose that the pap establishment allow opposition parties more opportunities to compete such as through more proportionate distribution of time during televised debates or even through more fair redistricting this would theoretically encourage more to engage in politics even if they are far out from the but this simply isnt possible in my opinion given the sheer landslide that the pap has won year after year it is unlikely for the opposition to make significant gains at least to the threshold to block constitutional amendments furthermore it can also be argued that political parties are already doing what they can to engage with younger voters for instance many mps already frequently engage with the local community taking part in local events and create online content inspired by their gen z staff as such it can also be argued that many in power are already doing as much as they can to so what can be done instead well the onus has to be on the youth themselves yes we should become more politically engaged with the happenings of singaporean politics but how could the average youth do so firstly for those who are extremely keen on joining a political party early on most established political parties have aforementioned youth wings that are open for volunteers volunteering for a political party can make one more aware of the issues in society today and is generally a great avenue to find friends and connect with politicians early on the main downside of doing so however is being affiliated to a political party early on and that many political parties have minimum ages to volunteer the pap being 17 and the workers party at 18 respectively secondly and whats far more feasible for many students and youth is to simply keep up with the latest parliamentary debates for instance cna frequently covers parliamentary debates as they go with important talking points being shared in their articles keeping up with whats relevant in the government today boosts ones understanding of the society around them not just that but asking questions on what was being debated and conducting civil discussions with those around you can help bring about awareness on these issues as well conclusion so given what ive mentioned here could a politician like mamdani someone who is apt in engaging with younger voters with youth centric policies and viral social media outreach rise in singapore personally given how the political climate is like we likely wont get a one to one copy of mamdani with the exact same policies however a candidate which aims to connect with youth through advocating for their interests like mental health awareness and financial worries online and reaching the algorithm can definitely be possible as social media becomes more vital to politicians to garner votes i feel its likely that many politicians even those in singapore might want to increase their presence online given the power of social media seen in mamdanis win but whats more important than any one individual candidate is our attitude to accept and demand for change through the proper channels from joining and volunteering for political parties the peoples association or even small things like reading up on the latest political developments every step helps to create a more politically conscious youth which can thus make their voices and votes heard when the elections come by so yes every small step counts towards crafting a better future for us all but with that im curious what are your opinions on youth political engagement in singapore and what can be done to make politics more appealing for more to take part in closing and thats the end of yet another post as you could probably tell this post was heavily inspired by mamdanis win in new york on wednesday and plus ive always wanted to tackle civil discourse and politics through this series as well and i felt like his win was the best time to do so anyways with os ending and as ongoing all the best in your exams",

of 94 an inference that their influence grew during the cold war to be in such a position what do we know about johnny he was born in college station tx on nov 16th 1988 he was sold to a group of nomads for a pack of cigarettes when he was 4 that he joined the army in mid2002 to fight in the 2nd central american war by 2003 he had lost a friend that had saved his life in combat lost an arm and deserted the military along with many others my headcanon robert john linder was born in college station tx on november 16th 1986 1 young johnnys mom was young herself in late 1985 she had in her 17yearold wisdom told her family to fuggoff and ran away to a town far far away full of pretty pretty boys by february 1986 she found herself pregnant in college station johnnys soontobe dad decided he needed to get his shit together to support this little family he had made and enrolled at the local university which also happened to be the largest nonstatesponsored military academy in the world johnnys dad threw himself into figuring out how to manage just enough college to keep in the rotc program whilst running himself ragged and neglecting his girlfriend and his sonand he smoked a lot his father died of lung cancer shortly after johnnys fourth birthday his mother alone with no support network and a 4yearold child was forced to reconcile with her family all the while 4yearold johnny is dealing with losing his hero soldier father this impression was mostly in johnnys mind but his age ensured that the impression was deep johnnys mom moves back to the hills and sticks of eastern oklahoma where she grew up probably around sallisaw or pocola this is in early 1991 johnny spent the next 3 years figuring out what this new life is all about and not liking all the sharp social edges that tore at the way his father had trained his mind to work 2 he took up one of his cousins guitars to escape from the redneck hillbilly hell that gnawed at his ego the world went to shit after the crash of 94 what that meant for the hillbillies of the ozarks and the ouachitas was that if you wanted to do business with texas you had to fight your way through the gauntlets they set up along i44 i35 i40 and i20 rumor has it that the coonasses closed down i10 too 3 these people who would go on to become a part of the mythological incarnation that came to be called nomad clans had shot out onto the desertified plains from springfield missouri to tyler and the outskirts of dallas they survived by raiding the highways the fuggin mad max pirates of america had their first goaround with the us forces trying to enforce the federal martial law decree out of mcconnell vance tinker and altus air force bases and the armor from forts sill and leonard wood johnny got a front row seat to watch his grandfather lead these pos punk motherfuggers in a noholdsbarred throwdown with the us military all across the crosstimbers 4 the american sahel by this point there was the raid on the enormous ammunition factory in mcalester and the doomed raid on the wolf creek nuclear plant in the spring of 2002 that saw johnnys mother mortally wounded blaming his grandfather for his mothers death and possessed with a rage learned from years of scraping by on the edge of civilization johnny cast off this counterfeit identity that his mothers horrible family had molded him into to follow that gleaming glorious honorable path that his 4yearold mind imagined his father had been on in the buildup for the second central american war which broke out in january 2003 johnny hotwired the first ride he could find to get his ass across the red river and into a recruiting station it didnt matter that he was underage he already had a beardenoughand they needed him 5 once the us diverted resources to central america the resistance to the nomad expansion disappeared they became a known quantity throughout the world the american cowboy reborn once yondu threatened a young peter quill that the crew would eat you were it not for yondus intervention a trauma reinforced sense of dependence johnnys grandpa tried to dissociate johnny from his dad by joking that johnnys dad had sold him to the nomads for a pack of cigarettes maybe less graceful than obiwans very similar lie it was true from a certain point of view how do i know thats a bs line in the immortal and timeline divergence immune words of bob saget marijuana is not a drug i used to suck dick for coke now thats an addiction you ever suck some dick for marijuana nobody is going to sell a child for a pack cigarettes but if you want your 5yearold grandchild to forsake that part of himself that he had to leave behind i can guess thats what he came up with 6 by the time he was telling his buddies in the army it was a funny joke then the not funny thing happened johnny got his arm blown off in a battle that took his best friends life while in recovery the real story behind the war set in for johnny the political desperation to mobilize people to shore up national support for the faltering government that he had believed in the pervasive intrusion of the militaryindustrial complex bent on stoking conflict and ultimately suffering for no better reason than profit it left johnny desperately conflicted between the shining sigil held forth by the memory of his father and the fugg erebody attitude imparted on him by his mother and grandfather a month after deserting from the va johhny was on the balcony of a hotel in pacifica screaming at the universe for a path forward hearing nothing johnny figured that the only path to walk then was his own the only way he knew to walk it was the path he had followed to survive this fugged upside down world the rebel path im certain that it was less than coincidence that samurais first gig was at the red dirt 1 i can believe that johnny lied to get into the military at 16 nearly 17 hes an exceptionally rare specimen that can hang with an infantry company at 15 2 the special dissonance that connects the larger texhoma region from wichita to austin is balanced on a pass through two of the oldest mountain ranges left on earth the wichita and ouachita ranges where all that is green and good lie to the south and all that is otherwise unattached stretches out northward like a nice porch its quite nice but its not the house the mangy runt thats tolerated because its part of the pack but is constantly reminded that its the mangy runt its a large chip on many shoulders 3 texas would have become economically isolated to some degree the inability of the federal government to keep the highways open and viable consistently would have isolated texas to some degree likely informing the decision to leave the us a situation not unlike the borders of between england and scotland before james vi became james i kinda the same people too 4 an oak savannah between the eastern forests and the great plains some of the oldest growth forest in the usonly because it has almost no economic value 5 i practically dove into the uniform 6 afterall my own grandfather lifted himself up on his last hospital bed at the ringing of my uncles cell phone to inform the room that i wouldnt have one of those damn things up my ass if i had room for a steam engine ah yes",

    "operating at the quantum limit with dr dana anderson july 4th 2025 operating at the quantum limit with dr dana anderson dr dana anderson cofounder and chief strategy officer of infleqtion formerly coldquanta presents a comprehensive vision of quantum technologys evolution from laboratory curiosity to practical commercial applications his perspective bridges fundamental physics engineering innovation and strategic market development in the emerging quantum ecosystem the foundation from quantum optics to cold atoms andersons journey began as an applied physicist trained in quantum optics working at the university of colorados jila institute alongside colleagues who won the 2001 nobel prize for demonstrating boseeinstein condensates this achievementcreating a new state of matter where atoms cooled to near absolute zero merge into a single quantum statebecame the technological foundation for infleqtions platformyoutubenewsmit1 the cooling mechanism itself represents an elegant application of quantum mechanics lasers absorb specific wavelengths of light from atoms removing kinetic energy through photon recoil anderson compares this to throwing ping pong balls at carsindividual photons dont carry much momentum but sufficient laser bombardment from all directions can halt atomic motion entirely reducing temperatures to microkelvin scales critically only the atoms become cold while surrounding apparatus remains at room temperature enabling practical deployment outside traditional cryogenic laboratory environmentsyoutube atomtronics a new technological paradigm anderson introduces atomtronics as the conceptual framework unifying infleqtions diverse product portfolio this paradigm draws direct parallels to electronics where atoms flowing through laserdefined pathways replace electrons moving through wires the atoms internal quantum states provide additional richness beyond conventional electronic circuits enabling applications spanning computation sensing and precision measurementsixfivemedia the advantages of neutral atoms as quantum platforms include their perfection as natures qubitsevery atom of a given element is identical and unchanging unlike fabricated superconducting circuits requiring clean rooms neutral atoms need no manufacturing process laser beams trap manipulate and address individual atoms with extraordinary precision holding them in optical lattices with forces reaching thousands of times earths gravity this robustness enables operation in harsh environments including vehicles autonomous systems and even spacebased platformsquantumworldcongress2 commercial strategy sensing leads the way anderson articulates a pragmatic path to quantum commercialization that diverges from the universal quantum

    "prologue of epica chapter 1 the planck epoch imagine a sentient world a universe capable of thought and feeling at his birth time and space were created and his expansion began from a singular hot point there was one unified force until he began to cool for billions of years he remained comatose unknowing of his own existence the universe was beginning its infancy and as things began to settle he gained sentience much like a baby becoming selfaware his body was the universe though he was able to explore his own reaches through a concentrated avatar from pure thought his avatar being made of his consciousness allowed him to transport himself across the universe in mere moments though he wasnt omnipresent his body was proportional to that of anyone elses one may not know what happens with every single cell in their body but possesses a general awareness oriion had a general awareness of how large he was and the forces that existed within him realizing he was alive billions of years into existence came an innate yearning to make up for the time lost at the moment of his awakening he did what any young being sprawled into a new world would do venture throughout his explorations he mostly saw an indescribable emptiness nothing persisted but eventually he saw fantastic celestial objects he numbered each of them until he lost count he observed planets and noted their features he saw the dust of nebulae collapse into burning stars he studied how each particle interacted with each other and started gaining an understanding of elements as time progressed he began assessing the threshold of his own power he discovered that he possessed the ability to move the objects in his own universal body with ease manipulate forces like gravity and electromagnetism influence the local laws of physics and possess a general omniscience of what happens within his cosmos with these abilities came an innate understanding to conduct this power with due regard this understanding would influence his interactions in the future chapter 2 the archean age throughout his travels hed make contact with the first signs of life on a planet designated terras in a star system located in the outer edges of the universe terras existed as a larger teal planet with strong gravity the climate was harsh with diamond rain and snow storms being a common occurrence it had an icy surface but was warm enough to host life that originated in caves terras resided in the habitable zone of its star system and possessed a thick atmosphere rich in alien elements the planets colossal mass allowed its atmosphere to persist furthermore a magnetic field protected terras from cosmic radiation which allowed its early lifeforms to evolve at a given pace with ease since terras bears a strong gravitational force its lifeforms evolved to be shorter in size for the ancestors of the terrakin the protokin that meant their general heights would be up to 4 feet in stature until theyd grow taller as they evolved as they originated in caves to keep warm they fed on lesser cave beings like terracytes and terrafins which are the aquatic life found in caves or their oceans when they became more civilized and technological theyd farm on mudgrain or geofruit which would eventually become their general sources of energy prior to their advancements they sported a short frame but robust body they possessed four limbs like a humanoid which was effective for traveling long distances and handling tools they were a unique classification of life adorned with silver colored skin that was thick enough for traversing rough terrain the strongest of the protokin had the strength to punch up to two tons which was useful for getting boulders out of the way protokin had poor eyesight due to the dark caves they dwelled in but in turn they were able to sense infrared and gravity fields as time passed most would lose those senses as they adapted to other climates climates they wouldnt have ventured in if not for the help of oriion himself he first made contact with them in their early beginnings exploring the desolate parts of terras oriion was perplexed at seeing life for the first time he was used to the abiotic characteristics of all the objects he observed but not the biotic ones for the first time he realized he wasnt alone and at that moment he felt the sentiment of solace of course in the perspective of the protokin they initially feared his looming avatar he would shorten his avatar in size so that they would be more familiar with them as if he were one of them and would go on to take the form of a humanoid as oriion observed them they became more familiar with him they saw similarities in him and began to trust him more oriion helped them in their endeavors to expand their populations as there were a mere several thousand of them at the time any severe weather that occurred near them oriion would merely cast away not only that he would reshape the planet to be more suitable for biodiversity readjusting its orbit and manipulating their homestars magnetic field so that it may last longer this allowed the protokin to be fruitful and flourish oriion would go on to show them what hed learn of the universe like a cosmic guide he helped them discover new foods like geofruit and mudgrain to expand their diets geofruit in particular was a specialized fruit created by crystallike plants rooted deep in the soil that siphoned energy from geothermal sources its mere nutrients slowly changed the physiology of the protokins over time via its own biochemicals unlocking a gene which allowed them to possess unique abilities amongst themselves protokins would exhibit different traits and started becoming more dissimilar from one another one protokins gene allowed them to possess super strength that allowed them to punch with 10 tons of force others genes allowed them to run at faster speeds up to 200 mph the gene would become the staple of modern terrakins and their uniqueness amongst other species and as centuries passed oriion and the protokin learned together the protokin steadily changed but oriion remained stagnant he led their people into new territories and ages leading them on expeditions across terras building them structures and sharing knowledge about the universe with them oriion brought resources and foreign samples that they could analyze for him while oriion would venture to find more studying them gave further insight into local biology physics chemistry cosmology and the overall science of oriion their numbers would steadily grow and they would utilize crystalline structures used for shelter and advanced machinery that allowed for transportation health and more advanced versions of spaceships wormhole generators and space suits were used to traverse the cosmos oriion with the help of the protokin would develop language that would later on to become universal amongst all species that inhabited oriion with all the knowledge oriion had gained since allying with the protokin came abrupt oblivion new information would replace old information and oriion would therein experience the plight of forgetfulness which typically posed an issue with many creatures possessing the characteristic of longevity as oriion forgot things the protokin soon noted them down for him which would in turn become the catalyst that forms the archives of oriion this was a colossal database that stored information and secrets only known to that of oriion himself oriion entrusted a select number of genius and wise people with his erudition designating them as members of the council of oriion chapter 3 the stelliferous era the council of oriion is the most intelligent beings chosen to moderate oriion the protokin realized that oriion possessed godlike power and some of them worried that he may abuse it in the future in a coup against them to ensure their trust oriion established the council so that they may manage any major decision in truth the council knew there was no way to truly enforce any edicts onto oriion but as long as oriion complied he would be in good graces with the protokin which was always subject to change oriion respects the council so that they may respect him he treats them as his leader even if he may not agree with them from time to time even if he could theoretically destroy them at any given whim factions of the protokin wanted oriion to leave them to their own destinies while most others welcomed his aid since oriion assigned the council the responsibility to safeguard all of his buried knowledge this would lend more credence to oriions loyalty to the protokin oriion transported an exoplanet from a nearby sector and placed it within the orbit of the terras system this planet would be known as sophus which stored the database for the archives of oriion and was heavily guarded by the council with this being established the process of delegating the members of the council of oriion included examinations that evaluated their intellect in regards to biology physics and science in general as the protokin evolved into the terrakin they spread their influence to intergalactic scales with the help of oriion they ventured through the universe and soon found more life after more exploration there were the etherians of etheria who were capable of absorbing lightning as energy then there were the gaians of gaia who lived on a supercontinent of a green planet they made contact with more intelligent societies and offered them a haven on their newly terraformed home planet previously known as terras now known as nexus cultures and communities throughout the cosmos were accepted into the protection of the terrakin and oriion with the dawn of this new age rising came new tensions accusations of speciesism became common seeing that oriion spent most of his time lending aid to the terrakin for centuries whilst races such as the etherians were left to their own crises like the deadly electric storms that nearly brought their kind to extinction oriion would frequently refute these allegations citing that he was unaware of the existence of foreign life yet many would doubt his responses he would ultimately embody contrition for not coming to the aid of the new species sooner to foreign species the terrakin were seen as coddled their civilization had a head start as opposed to others despite this notion the terrakin would regard it with high esteem extraterrestrials began populating nexus and it became the home planet for many species though as societies merged came new rules of law the mission of the council is referred to as two duties reduce suffering and promote felicity the council of oriion has determined that these unique endeavors be prohibited time travel via reversing and forwarding time other than the typical process of its linear progression towards the future is forbidden to ensure proper stability of the spacetime continuum seeing as most of the council are not familiar with the subject nor its prospective outcomes bioengineering in any sense which includes but is not limited to interspecies breeding cloning and gene editing is forbidden to ensure no one can abuse its capabilities artificial intelligence whether lesser or of superior intellect is forbidden to ensure that no reasoning entity may be enslaved nor have their capabilities be abused mass surveillance via observing intelligent lifeforms without their expressed consent or strict understanding of the party being there is forbidden though is mainly applied to oriion himself resurrection of any dead lifeform is forbidden unless naturally caused to ensure the veneration and inviolability of the dead finally physical harm outside of defense which includes but is not limited to murder is forbidden to ensure the reduction of suffering across all forms of life these are the current forbidden acts that all species under the protection of oriion and the council must abide by certain subsets of endeavors are also prohibited interspecies relationships promote offspring of hybrid origin and so this act is deemed as bioengineering and therefore barred indubitably many lifeforms disregard this particular prohibited activity due to emotional interests typically those relationships are made secret so as to not be made subject to punitive action there are exemptions in regards to few rules in which the council typically vote in which situation the prohibited activities may be used if it can contribute to the mission of reducing suffering and promoting felicity or if the perceived subsets of certain prohibited activities do not fall under the definition of said prohibited activity computers and probes contain information but do not fall under the definition of artificial intelligence which is of mere sentient intelligence regardless of rules most living beings strive for pleasure this collective effort requires a focused organization that may enforce these values and so this would be the beginnings of venturia prime these would become the heroes defenders and explorers of oriion chapter 4 the diamond age venturians are typically assigned to protect life explore unknown territories and recruit new venturians these assignments make it so that oriion isnt the only one to carry out these operations and may delegate time to more prioritized duties the council prefers to keep advanced technology out of the hands of venturians and commonfolk but will allow it in certain conditions such as for language translators life suits or super ships their reasoning is that revolutionary technology could potentially be abused generally speaking rules are not utilized in the effort to enforce order but rather a guideline which is to reduce suffering if someone under venturian rule purposefully performs a decision that leads to suffering they may be subject to punishment after a report is filed for the innumerable amount of duties tasked to the venturians are where trials are required new recruits are poised to undergo tests to determine their limits whether that be if they can survive the vacuum of space and for how long cope with extreme temperatures ranging from cold to hot withstand cosmic radiation endure physical forces or resist the overloading of senses depending on how they fare they will be given missions that they may or may not accept depending on the scale of their strengths and weaknesses after theyve earned the title of venturian they will undergo irregular competitions to further determine their levels of power whether these championships are held annually quarterly or daily as well as the amount members of the championship are at the discretion of the council of oriion these championships will determine who may be the strongest venturian among them all and those strongest will be referred to as the adventurians these members are held to the highest regard of venturia prime and interact with the council of oriion much often they will be considered for the most crucial missions those who choose to quit will not be punished but are typically looked down on by other venturians these championships require immense space so that collateral damage will be minimized therefore the colossal sand planet designated xerath would be placed in the terras system by oriion himself it would be one of many planets added to the terras system with the ark planets joining in to be continued",

    "what is the purpose of barnaby joyce barnaby joyce has always talked a story about himself bigger than the brim on his hopalong cassidy hat he is a oneman plot line but his achievements for the people he professes to represent are slim to infinitesimal even joyces former campaign manager mayor of tamworth russell webb told local television barnaby cant get anything done somehow he is being rewarded for all this his threats to leave the nationals have put him in the headlines he so adores and helped end his partys commitment to net zero in the process hes possibly destroyed the coalition rarely has a man of such little substance had so much consequence if joyce makes good on his promise and leaves politics at the next election what would it mean for the people of new england and for australian politics more broadly in my view it is good news for new england there is no doubt the joyce brand has resonated with many particularly his antiparty party stance and there has been plenty of colour and movement to distract people on the ground however very little has been happening in the seat since he was elected in 2013 he has always been more interested in politics than people and new england was just a runway to ambition next to no infrastructure has been built in the electorate in the past decade other than the illthoughtout relocation of the australian pesticides and veterinary medicines authority to armidale the man who promised to build 100 dams has built net zero in fact the only real infrastructure changes and the jobs that go with them have been renewable energy projects dismissed and denigrated by joyce as eyesores and factories with little social licence these renewable projects have become a major part of the rationale joyce uses to explain his estrangement from the nationals he claims he must act to stop this scourge moving across the landscape to protect farmland of course the sentiment is wrongheaded but its also hypocritical thats joyces two modes in one position his criticism of renewable projects stands in stark contrast to his inaction on santoss coal seam gas developments on the liverpool plains also within the seat of new england which will wreak havoc on farmland the liverpool plains have some of the best soil in the world outside ukraine and are also part of the largest subartesian groundwater resource in the murraydarling system in addition they are adjacent to the great artesian basin which is the lifeblood of 24 per cent of australias landmass critical issues for the local mp one would think but silence from the man in the hat it is worth noting that the windmills used to pump water from underground have been replaced by solar pumps the windmills were never considered a blight on the horizon but a sign of progress and prosperity for the driest continent on earth joyces distaste for renewable energy and his silence towards coal seam gas highlights his real agenda driven by gina rinehart and others it puts the farming community in a very difficult position one that farm leaders will need to think about very seriously im writing this at the same time environment minister murray watt tries to walk both sides of the street in revamping the nations dysfunctional environment laws what has not been well noticed is a new provision to walk back the water trigger julia gillard inserted into environment law in the dying days of her prime ministership watt is seeking to have it revert to the states whose record on water is mixed to be generous last week the premier of new south wales chris minns popped up threatening the compulsory acquisition of farmland to get a gas pipeline through to the santosbacked narrabri gas project against the determined and persistent opposition of local landholders the premier would well know the santos proposal which currently has signoff on extracting gas above the great artesian basin needs to have subtle guarantees from government that if it begins work at narrabri it will have access to the liverpool plains in future to make the project economical the pipeline is the head of the snake from barnaby joyce radio silence i wonder why in short then does the farming community submit to the populist view of the world being espoused by one nation and many in the nationals and that of the great climate scientist tony abbott that climate change is absolute crap or do they embrace the opportunities and challenges of the next century and recognise they will experience profound benefits if australia leads the way on renewable energy and sustainable farming systems here are the raw politics of this debate first the coalition is out of government for at least two terms longer if the nationals continue their farce on net zero joyce and his cronies will have next to no chance of achieving any substantive outcomes other than pandering to lazy media in the hope of attracting attention second china will become the dominant player in the world and will take the lead on addressing climate change thus enhancing its economic strength as the united states declines the popular narrative used by climate deniers that there is no point acting if china doesnt will fade very quickly and once again china will be ahead of the rest third europe and other affluent parts of the world will demand food that is produced in countries wishing to reduce global emissions tariffs and other charges are already being contemplated by many countries like it or not they are becoming a significant part of international trade if farmers fall for the siren song of joyce rinehart and one nation they run the risk of being seen as climate deniers and the political impacts of this stance populist as it may be would be massively damaging to country people this would be their brexit the pain of which will be felt long after the good idea at the time caravan disappears over the dusty horizon we already have witnessed domestic political upheaval from joyces anticlimate rhetoric which has damaged the coalition and propelled the teals and other independents into parliament polling suggests independents could win up to six more seats at the next election city dwellers have always had a somewhat romantic view of rural and remote australia tinged with great regard and respect for those producing good food at a good price in a relatively harsh environment and for others who live and work in those communities most australians do not live far from the coast that situation is not changing so the likelihood of any country ginger group taking over our parliaments is remote to say the least we are not trumps america regard and affection for our inland inhabitants is demonstrated by governments of all persuasions encouraged by our metropolitan communities assisting the farm sector and country people generally in times of flood fire drought and cyclones i have always read it as a way of saying thanks for what you do for us and the economy in the good times yet as climate change has turbocharged the weather systems many people in australia are more and more concerned about the future of generations to come this will be reflected in the way they vote and the policies that will apply to regional australia over time if farmers and regional people follow the joyce and abbott line of doing nothing about climate change the victims of extreme climate events will be themselves and they may no longer be able to rely on citybased governments being prepared to wear the cost agriculture would risk losing the social licence it has always enjoyed it was interesting to watch some of the recent tamworth defectors from the nationals to one nation explaining their motivation by decrying renewables and climate change as major reasons these are the same people who would be in my office when i was in politics asking for financial assistance any time an adverse weather event occurred do they really expect that to keep happening if they deny the science and australias part in the remedies on offer cheaper cleaner more reliable energy the coastal majority may well be impacted by climate change but not to the same extent as the agricultural sector abatements in the cities might involve more barricades on the coastline where storm surges occur larger airconditioning units and maybe ironically an extra solar panel or two or a battery in the garage for farmers climate change takes down the entire business model australia has led the world on dryland farming systems and has been part of the development of renewable energy technology we should be proud of those achievements and build on them we should not listen to shortterm selfserving narcissists the nationals are in retreat they lost the seat of calare at the last election failed to pick up bendigo despite a milliondollar campaign and helped the coalition lose the seat of bullwinkel by running against the liberals there dividing communities against each other and against their best interests can only encourage more country people to look elsewhere for genuine representation the question is only whether that happens before the metropolitan majority declare themselves unprepared to help communities that wont help themselves",
    "need some help optimizing for an academic research use case hi all so first time poster somewhat recently arrived lurker have been building my own computers forever including my current workstation but am getting to the point now where a constellation of changes in my workloads and having more people working under me has made me finally willing to invest in a more performant and scalable compute system this is where im hoping the sub can come to my rescue the problem im part of a lab at an r1 university that works with a combination of very highresolution spatial and climate data think daily 1km or even sub1km resolution for that is then processed for use in downstream causal inference and dataset generation both steps being done internally by our lab though often by different groups of people our lab also routinely generates our own data using the downstream products using modern but light ml architectures think rf gradient boosted decision trees etc we have access to highperformance computing through the university but it is not feasible for some lab members to use hpc clusters due to lack of permissions or lack of expertise and pushing my ras onto the hpc tends to massively increase turnaround time because of how much it slows the ability to iterate scripts quickly and writing code that produces very detailed and informative console output that can be used for effective debugging is not a skill most of my ras have prototyping on local machines is typically prohibitively costlycomplex and it is often the case that problems wont crop up on the relatively small portion of data they pull in while working locally when pushing stuff to the hpc we also are always having to contend with culling what data is being housed in the university data center because of pretty low limits there the data security and admin needs of such a universitywide hpc are also very cumbersome for us since we work with data that is publicly available and not subject to any securityprivacy risk tldr building our own compute resource that allows at least a couple lab members at a time to work directly from the gui in a live ide session especially for debugging as a script is being run at scale for the first time makes a lot of sense compute and storage needs we have basically two kinds of workflows both entirely cpubound or memorybound no one in the lab has any facility with writing code that can utilize modern gpus and that code would not be very reproducible by the broader community so assume very little can be pushed onto the gpu except what is possible passively under the hood in linux via stuff like using nvidia nvblas the first is very memory intensive but not incredibly coreintensive typical workflows here would be something like 510gbworker these workflows require ondemand access to one or more hires data products ranging between 50500gb per product typical workflows parallelize over subsets of these products with a subset of the product loaded in by each worker because of this data io is a huge bottleneck and the use of nvme drives here is basically mandatory these workflows are typically handled by me but thats because i built a workstation specially designed to do this the second is very coreintensive but not especially memory intensive think big dataframes with lots of matrix operations closer to 1gbworker the main bottleneck here is cores although of course if you pushed the cores up enough youd have to contend with memory bottlenecks eventually but at that point our runtimes would be plenty fast enough the workflows are typically sequential the ramintensive processing happens first then the coreintensive downstream tasks after both workflows require ondisk access to anywhere from 2tb to 10tb at a time needless to say all of this very quickly outstrips what can be done on the local machines that people come to the lab with typically overpriced mac laptops and the like the one thing we have going in our favor is that we have a ton of cloud storage on our enterprise account 75tb of which about 30tb is currently being used the proposed solution so this is where you guys come in hoping for some feedback here im basically building this off my own dime due to the budget cuts so im trying to work with what i already have which is essentially 2 rigs in addition to providing a much easier development environment for people in the lab it also arbitrages off the one thing we have working for us free electricity from the uni building so while component costs are a real constraint the power footprint can be anything reasonable trx40 aorus master threadripper 3960x w 420mm aio cooler for sustained allcore loads 256gb 3200mhz corsair vengeance lpx unfortunately this is max on tr40 boards 3090 fe essentially completely useless except for some light ml applications 2tb boot drive 2x 4tb gen4 nvme main drives run in raid0 in a m2 hyperx card with pcie bifurcation no scratch drive at the moment looking to add one as we speak 1200w psu the second rig which im building out right now and paying through the nose to max out the ram on is supermicro smc x11dpht 2x xeon gold 6240 128gb ddr4 2666mhz 16x8gb 1tb nvme ssd boot drive no scratch or storage drives yet my plan is to split our pipelines into two pieces the initial processing pipeline which will be handled by the threadripper machine this would eventually be replaced by an epyc machine with 512gb of ddr4 once prices come down and the downstream analysisdataset generation pipeline which will be handled by dual xeon rig to avoid having to build out a bunch of storage on each machine my plan was to just add a scratch drive to the second rig and then build out a storage rack that would essentially be a local mirror of our cloud account chatgpt is telling me to house the nas on the dual xeon rig to cut down costs seems reasonable it has to be fast enough to pull something like 13tb onto the scratch drive in a reasonable amount of time lets say a couple hours and write the output back without bottlenecking things too badly but because all our data will be mirrored in the cloud im not too worried about building tons of redundancy here was thinking raidz2 or raid10like so my first question is does this make sense or is it really dumb for some reason i dont fully understand my second question is supposing this isnt dumb what is the optimal way to access both machines our lab has members in multiple countries and on multiple continents so an ideal solution would be one that doesnt require a ton of setup on the user side andor that isnt too complexfragile but also lets them have lowlatency so that it isnt too painful to do build out scripts in a remote environment my third question is assuming this setup is reasonable what is the best storage solution ive been doing lots of research but this is by far the area where i know the least and rather than say some buzzword shit i dont really understand hba synology blah blah blah id rather just hear what you all think cost is a pretty serious constraint here as all of the storage hardware will need to be purchased but everything will be bought used in an attempt to hit the desired throughput to the compute rigs without breaking the bank if you got to the end thanks for reading all this and apologies if any of this comes off as stupidly misguided i am basically a researcher and very light pc enthusiast who is trying to get us the functionality we need so im definitely not the hero we need but im the one we got hoping you guys have some good ideas thanks in advance",

    "billingsley construction completes futr haus a new benchmark for sustainable home builders in vancouver the team at billingsley construction has acted as luxury home builders in vancouver for 30 years our reputation was built by carefully combining precision construction and craftsmanship to help our clients realize their vision for refined homes built to exacting standards on the west coast over the years weve seen a transition theres still plenty of demand for luxury home construction but with an emphasis on greener builds people want sustainable home builders to create spaces that will have a positive impact on their familiesand the people in their communities futrhaus was completed at 1156 east 13th avenue in vancouvers mount pleasant neighbourhood in 2019 designed by b squared architecture inc our team at billingsley home construction was brought in to build the homes the threeunit multiplex residence sits on a previous singlefamily lot to meet muchneeded demand for threebedroom family housing in vancouver additionally the multiplex housing had to be built to passive house energy standards aligning with the city of vancouvers goal for sustainability up to 90 energy savings through superior construction futrhaus went on to become one of vancouvers first residential developments to combine a singlehome to multiunit housing conversion with passive house green building technology however it was also built to luxury standards including hardwood flooring high ceilings elegant gourmet kitchens featuring large islands topoftheline appliances and beautiful indoortooutdoor transitions leading to large balconies and patios its a project that not only emphasizes living sustainably but living well with all the amenities needed for a comfortable and luxurious family home what set this project apart was adherence to the highperformance passive house standard we were able to achieve through construction choices like thickened walls tripleglazed windows solar orientation and a heatrecovery ventilator hrv system we tempered these choices with systems for air filtration to remove dust and pollen so while the house is tightly sealed it still feels fresh clean and airynot stuffy which has been a criticism for passive homes without the right planning together these features not only resulted in a comfortable energyefficient homethey resulted in energy savings of up to 90 compared to conventional construction sustainable home builders in vancouver today more people are willing to pay a premium for ecofriendly properties to realize substantial longterm savings on energy and water bills due to features like highperformance insulation tripleglazed windows and energyefficient appliances additionally green homes are likely to have a higher resale value and sell faster than conventional homes making them a sound investment in the competitive vancouver real estate market as experienced sustainable home builders in vancouver we work with architects investors and families collaborating on projects that range from family homes to multiplex projects that are redefining sustainability and comfort at home some of the benefits of our passive and sustainable builds include longterm cost savings energy efficiency with energyuse reductions up to 90 as in futrhaus homeowners face significantly lower heating and cooling bills in a region with rising utility costs and growing interest in reducing monthly expenditures this is a clear advantage health and comfort a sealed wellinsulated building envelope paired with hrv systems means fewer drafts more consistent indoor temperatures and cleaner air climate action regulatory alignment the city of vancouver has committed to ambitious emissionsreduction and buildingperformance goals sustainable construction practices align with these regulatory motions while also appealing to buyers who care about environmental impact projects meeting passive house or similar standards are increasingly seen as part of the solution futureproofing property value sustainable homes may hold their value better over time as energy standards tighten and consumer preferences shift in a competitive market like vancouvers offering a home built to high environmental standards is a differentiator responding to densification and changing housing needs with the city encouraging missing middle housing and more efficient use of singlefamily lots highperformance multiunit conversions like futrhaus address both sustainability and housing supply where luxury meets sustainability at

    "presentday climate change includes both global warmingthe ongoing increase in global average temperatureand its wider effects on earths climate system climate change in a broader sense also includes previous longterm changes to earths climate the current rise in global temperatures is driven by human activities especially fossil fuel coal oil and natural gas burning since the industrial revolution fossil fuel use deforestation and some agricultural and industrial practices release greenhouse gases these gases absorb some of the heat that the earth radiates after it warms from sunlight warming the lower atmosphere carbon dioxide the primary gas driving global warming has increased in concentration by about 50 since the preindustrial era to levels not seen for millions of years climate change has an increasingly large impact on the environment deserts are expanding while heat waves and wildfires are becoming more common amplified warming in the arctic has contributed to thawing permafrost retreat of glaciers and sea ice decline higher temperatures are also causing more intense storms droughts and other weather extremes rapid environmental change in mountains coral reefs and the arctic is forcing many species to relocate or become extinct even if efforts to minimize future warming are successful some effects will continue for centuries these include ocean heating ocean acidification and sea level rise climate change threatens people with increased flooding extreme heat increased food and water scarcity more disease and economic loss human migration and conflict can also be a result the world health organization calls climate change one of the biggest threats to global health in the 21st century societies and ecosystems will experience more severe risks without action to limit warming adapting to climate change through efforts like flood control measures or droughtresistant crops partially reduces climate change risks although some limits to adaptation have already been reached poorer communities are responsible for a small share of global emissions yet have the least ability to adapt and are most vulnerable to climate change many climate change impacts have been observed in the first decades of the 21st century with 2024 the warmest on record at 160 c 288 f since regular tracking began in 1850 additional warming will increase these impacts and can trigger tipping points such as melting all of the greenland ice sheet under the 2015 paris agreement nations collectively agreed to keep warming well under 2 c however with pledges made under the agreement global warming would still reach about 28 c 50 f by the end of the century there is widespread support for climate action worldwide and most countries aim to stop emitting carbon dioxide fossil fuels can be phased out by stopping subsidising them conserving energy and switching to energy sources that do not produce significant carbon pollution these energy sources include wind solar hydro and nuclear power cleanly generated electricity can replace fossil fuels for powering transportation heating buildings and running industrial processes carbon can also be removed from the atmosphere for instance by increasing forest cover and farming with methods that store carbon in soil terminology before the 1980s it was unclear whether the warming effect of increased greenhouse gases was stronger than the cooling effect of airborne particulates in air pollution scientists used the term inadvertent climate modification to refer to human impacts on the climate at this time in the 1980s the terms global warming and climate change became more common often being used interchangeably scientifically global warming refers only to increased global average surface temperature while climate change describes both global warming and its effects on earths climate system such as precipitation changes climate change can also be used more broadly to include changes to the climate that have happened throughout earths history global warmingused as early as 1975became the more popular term after nasa climate scientist james hansen used it in his 1988 testimony in the us senate since the 2000s usage of climate change has increased various scientists politicians and media may use the terms climate crisis or climate emergency to talk about climate change and may use the term global heating instead of global warming global temperature rise temperatures prior to presentday global warming over the last few million years the climate cycled through ice ages one of the hotter periods was the last interglacial around 125000 years ago where temperatures were between 05 c and 15 c warmer than before the start of global warming this period saw sea levels 5 to 10 metres higher than today the most recent glacial maximum 20000 years ago was some 57 c colder this period has sea levels that were over 125 metres 410 ft lower than today temperatures stabilized in the current interglacial period beginning 11700 years ago this period also saw the start of agriculture historical patterns of warming and cooling like the medieval warm period and the little ice age did not occur at the same time across different regions temperatures may have reached as high as those of the late 20th century in a limited set of regions climate information for that period comes from climate proxies such as trees and ice cores warming since the industrial revolution around 1850 thermometer records began to provide global coverage between the 18th century and 1970 there was little net warming as the warming impact of greenhouse gas emissions was offset by cooling from sulfur dioxide emissions sulfur dioxide causes acid rain but it also produces sulfate aerosols in the atmosphere which reflect sunlight and cause global dimming after 1970 the increasing accumulation of greenhouse gases and controls on sulfur pollution led to a marked increase in temperature ongoing changes in climate have had no precedent for several thousand years multiple datasets all show worldwide increases in surface temperature at a rate of around 02 c per decade the 20142023 decade warmed to an average 119 c 106130 c compared to the preindustrial baseline 18501900 not every single year was warmer than the last internal climate variability processes can make any year 02 c warmer or colder than the average from 1998 to 2013 negative phases of two such processes pacific decadal oscillation pdo and atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo caused a short slower period of warming called the global warming hiatus after the hiatus the opposite occurred with 2024 well above the recent average at more than 15 c this is why the temperature change is defined in terms of a 20year average which reduces the noise of hot and cold years and decadal climate patterns and detects the longterm signal a wide range of other observations reinforce the evidence of warming the upper atmosphere is cooling because greenhouse gases are trapping heat near the earths surface and so less heat is radiating into space warming reduces average snow cover and forces the retreat of glaciers at the same time warming also causes greater evaporation from the oceans leading to more atmospheric humidity more and heavier precipitation plants are flowering earlier in spring and thousands of animal species have been permanently moving to cooler areas differences by region different regions of the world warm at different rates the pattern is independent of where greenhouse gases are emitted because the gases persist long enough to diffuse across the planet since the preindustrial period the average surface temperature over land regions has increased almost twice as fast as the global average surface temperature this is because oceans lose more heat by evaporation and oceans can store a lot of heat the thermal energy in the global climate system has grown with only brief pauses since at least 1970 and over 90 of this extra energy has been stored in the ocean the rest has heated the atmosphere melted ice and warmed the continents the northern hemisphere and the north pole have warmed much faster than the south pole and southern hemisphere the northern hemisphere not only has much more land but also more seasonal snow cover and sea ice as these surfaces flip from reflecting a lot of light to being dark after the ice has melted they start absorbing more heat local black carbon deposits on snow and ice also contribute to arctic warming arctic surface temperatures are increasing between three and four times faster than in the rest of the world melting of ice sheets near the poles weakens both the atlantic and the antarctic limb of thermohaline circulation which further changes the distribution of heat and precipitation around the globe future global temperatures the world meteorological organization estimates there is almost a 50 chance of the fiveyear average global temperature exceeding 15 c between 2024 and 2028 the ipcc expects the 20year average to exceed 15 c in the early 2030s the ipcc sixth assessment report 2021 included projections that by 2100 global warming is very likely to reach 1018 c under a scenario with very low emissions of greenhouse gases 2135 c under an intermediate emissions scenario or 3357 c under a very high emissions scenario the warming will continue past 2100 in the intermediate and high emission scenarios with future projections of global surface temperatures by year 2300 being similar to millions of years ago the remaining carbon budget for staying beneath certain temperature increases is determined by modelling the carbon cycle and climate sensitivity to greenhouse gases according to unep global warming can be kept below 20 c with a 50 chance if emissions after 2023 do not exceed 900 gigatonnes of co2 this carbon budget corresponds to around 16 years of current emissions causes of recent global temperature rise the climate system experiences various cycles on its own which can last for years decades or even centuries for example el nio events cause shortterm spikes in surface temperature while la nia events cause short term cooling their relative frequency can affect global temperature trends on a decadal timescale other changes are caused by an imbalance of energy from external forcings examples of these include changes in the concentrations of greenhouse gases solar luminosity volcanic eruptions and variations in the earths orbit around the sun to determine the human contribution to climate change unique fingerprints for all potential causes are developed and compared with both observed patterns and known internal climate variability for example solar forcingwhose fingerprint involves warming the entire atmosphereis ruled out because only the lower atmosphere has warmed atmospheric aerosols produce a smaller cooling effect other drivers such as changes in albedo are less impactful greenhouse gases greenhouse gases are transparent to sunlight and thus allow it to pass through the atmosphere to heat the earths surface the earth radiates it as heat and greenhouse gases absorb a portion of it this absorption slows the rate at which heat escapes into space trapping heat near the earths surface and warming it over time while water vapour 50 and clouds 25 are the biggest contributors to the greenhouse effect they primarily change as a function of temperature and are therefore mostly considered to be feedbacks that change climate sensitivity on the other hand concentrations of gases such as co2 20 tropospheric ozone cfcs and nitrous oxide are added or removed independently from temperature and are therefore considered to be external forcings that change global temperatures before the industrial revolution naturally occurring amounts of greenhouse gases caused the air near the surface to be about 33 c warmer than it would have been in their absence human activity since the industrial revolution mainly extracting and burning fossil fuels coal oil and natural gas has increased the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere in 2022 the concentrations of co2 and methane had increased by about 50 and 164 respectively since 1750 these co2 levels are higher than they have been at any time during the last 14 million years concentrations of methane are far higher than they were over the last 800000 years global humancaused greenhouse gas emissions in 2019 were equivalent to 59 billion tonnes of co2 of these emissions 75 was co2 18 was methane 4 was nitrous oxide and 2 was fluorinated gases co2 emissions primarily come from burning fossil fuels to provide energy for transport manufacturing heating and electricity additional co2 emissions come from deforestation and industrial processes which include the co2 released by the chemical reactions for making cement steel aluminium and fertilizer methane emissions come from livestock manure rice cultivation landfills wastewater and coal mining as well as oil and gas extraction nitrous oxide emissions largely come from the microbial decomposition of fertilizer while methane only lasts in the atmosphere for an average of 12 years co2 lasts much longer the earths surface absorbs co2 as part of the carbon cycle while plants on land and in the ocean absorb most excess emissions of co2 every year that co2 is returned to the atmosphere when biological matter is digested burns or decays landsurface carbon sink processes such as carbon fixation in the soil and photosynthesis remove about 29 of annual global co2 emissions the ocean has absorbed 20 to 30 of emitted co2 over the last two decades co2 is only removed from the atmosphere for the long term when it is stored in the earths crust which is a process that can take millions of years to complete land surface changes around 30 of earths land area is largely unusable for humans glaciers deserts etc 26 is forests 10 is shrubland and 34 is agricultural land deforestation is the main land use change contributor to global warming as the destroyed trees release co2 and are not replaced by new trees removing that carbon sink between 2001 and 2018 27 of deforestation was from permanent clearing to enable agricultural expansion for crops and livestock another 24 has been lost to temporary clearing under the shifting cultivation agricultural systems 26 was due to logging for wood and derived products and wildfires have accounted for the remaining 23 some forests have not been fully cleared but were already degraded by these impacts restoring these forests also recovers their potential as a carbon sink local vegetation cover impacts how much of the sunlight gets reflected back into space albedo and how much heat is lost by evaporation for instance the change from a dark forest to grassland makes the surface lighter causing it to reflect more sunlight deforestation can also modify the release of chemical compounds that influence clouds and by changing wind patterns in tropic and temperate areas the net effect is to produce significant warming and forest restoration can make local temperatures cooler at latitudes closer to the poles there is a cooling effect as forest is replaced by snowcovered and more reflective plains globally these increases in surface albedo have been the dominant direct influence on temperature from land use change thus land use change to date is estimated to have a slight cooling effect other factors aerosols and clouds air pollution in the form of aerosols affects the climate on a large scale aerosols scatter and absorb solar radiation from 1961 to 1990 a gradual reduction in the amount of sunlight reaching the earths surface was observed this phenomenon is popularly known as global dimming and is primarily attributed to sulfate aerosols produced by the combustion of fossil fuels with heavy sulfur concentrations like coal and bunker fuel smaller contributions come from black carbon from combustion of fossil fuels and biomass and from dust globally aerosols have been declining since 1990 due to pollution controls meaning that they no longer mask greenhouse gas warming as much aerosols also have indirect effects on the earths energy budget sulfate aerosols act as cloud condensation nuclei and lead to clouds that have more and smaller cloud droplets these clouds reflect solar radiation more efficiently than clouds with fewer and larger droplets they also reduce the growth of raindrops which makes clouds more reflective to incoming sunlight indirect effects of aerosols are the largest uncertainty in radiative forcing while aerosols typically limit global warming by reflecting sunlight black carbon in soot that falls on snow or ice can contribute to global warming not only does this increase the absorption of sunlight it also increases melting and sealevel rise limiting new black carbon deposits in the arctic could reduce global warming by 02 c by 2050 the effect of decreasing sulfur content of fuel oil for ships since 2020 is estimated to cause an additional 005 c increase in global mean temperature by 2050 solar and volcanic activity as the sun is the earths primary energy source changes in incoming sunlight directly affect the climate system solar irradiance has been measured directly by satellites and indirect measurements are available from the early 1600s onwards since 1880 there has been no upward trend in the amount of the suns energy reaching the earth in contrast to the warming of the lower atmosphere the troposphere the upper atmosphere the stratosphere would also be warming if the sun was sending more energy to earth but instead it has been cooling this is consistent with greenhouse gases preventing heat from leaving the earths atmosphere explosive volcanic eruptions can release gases dust and ash that partially block sunlight and reduce temperatures or they can send water vapour into the atmosphere which adds to greenhouse gases and increases temperatures these impacts on temperature only last for several years because both water vapour and volcanic material have low persistence in the atmosphere volcanic co2 emissions are more persistent but they are equivalent to less than 1 of current humancaused co2 emissions volcanic activity still represents the single largest natural impact forcing on temperature in the industrial era yet like the other natural forcings it has had negligible impacts on global temperature trends since the industrial revolution climate change feedbacks the climate systems response to an initial forcing is shaped by feedbacks which either amplify or dampen the change selfreinforcing or positive feedbacks increase the response while balancing or negative feedbacks reduce it the main reinforcing feedbacks are the watervapour feedback the icealbedo feedback and the net cloud feedback the primary balancing mechanism is radiative cooling as earths surface gives off more heat to space in response to rising temperature in addition to temperature feedbacks there are feedbacks in the carbon cycle such as the fertilizing effect of co2 on plant growth feedbacks are expected to trend in a positive direction as greenhouse gas emissions continue raising climate sensitivity these feedback processes alter the pace of global warming for instance warmer air can hold more moisture in the form of water vapour which is itself a potent greenhouse gas warmer air can also make clouds higher and thinner and therefore more insulating increasing climate warming the reduction of snow co",
