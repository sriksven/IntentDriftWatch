at anseo mo bheirt mhac mo fhearchile mo dheirfiracha mo dhearthireacha thaisteal siad cheann ceann an domhain atlanta georgia ceanada toronto agus mle buochas go chuir siad an dua sin orthu fin i stand before you humbly and proudly as the 10th president of this beautiful country the people have spoken and have given their president a powerful mandate to articulate their vision for a new republic a republic worthy of its name where everyone is valued and diversity is cherished where sustainable solutions are urgently implemented and where a home is a fundamental human right the change that led to this joyful day began with a small group of elected representatives and volunteers facing what appeared to be insurmountable challenges we were led to believe that it was too great a leap that our ideas were too far out too left at odds with the prevailing narrative in shared conversations all over the country however it became evident that the dominant narrative did not reflect or represent peoples values and concerns time and time again people spoke of how it served to silence to other to label to exclude and to stifle critical thinking along with that however along with meaningful engagement we saw the emergence of hope we saw the emergence of joy along with the courage and determination of people to use their voices to shape a country that we can be proud of as president of ireland i will ensure that all voices are represented heard and valued and promote a public discourse that nourishes inclusivity tolerance and active citizenship previous presidents faced different challenges reflecting the dominant issues of the day in 1990 when mary robinson and i want to welcome mary robinson and her husband nick when mary was elected the parameters of geopolitics were shifting following the fall of the berlin wall the previous year and the dissolution of the soviet union while at home ireland was undergoing its own seismic changes laying the foundation for a modern and inclusive society in 1997 one year before the good friday agreement the former president mary mcaleese and again i want to welcome the former president and husband martin was elected in the midst of the ongoing peace process a landmark event in shaping a shared vision for the future of ireland in 2011 michael d higgins assumed office and again i want to pay tribute to his courage and his work michael d assumed office as a global financial collapse shook ireland and the world the reverberations of that crisis continue to impact upon and shape peoples lives and our economy now in 2025 as i assume the privilege of office we face the existential threat of climate change and the threat of ongoing wars both of course are inextricably linked as i speak i am acutely conscious of the 165 million people currently forcibly displaced from their homes and countries due to war famine and climate change we cannot turn back the clock nor close our eyes to these realities these are the challenges of our times and our actions or inaction will determine the world our children and grandchildren will inherit it is both an individual and a collective challenge and one which obliges us to reflect on the way we live and interact with our world and with each other it is also the responsibility of those entrusted with public office to come together both nationally and internationally to lead and to create the conditions for a sustainable existence on our planet it is significant that today is remembrance day the eleventh of the eleventh 2025 it is significant on so many levels but it gives us an opportunity to pause and reflect on the horrors of war in a world where unfortunately we have all become witnesses to ongoing wars and genocide given our history the normalisation of war and genocide has never been and will never be acceptable to us as a sovereign independent nation with a long and cherished tradition of neutrality and an uninterrupted record of peacekeeping since 1958 ireland is particularly well placed to lead and articulate alternative diplomatic solutions to conflict and war indeed our experience of colonisation and resistance of a catastrophic manmade famine and forced emigration gives us a lived understanding of dispossession hunger and war and a mandate for ireland to lead we can and should take real pride in the success of the good friday agreement knowing that this is recognised far and wide and is a model for peaceful resolution of conflict we also know that this journey of peace and reconciliation was the result of meticulous and methodical work over a long period of time and this work continues to this day i look forward to paying my first official visit to the north and meeting with people from all communities and celebrating the rich heritage and traditions of all who live there i am particularly conscious of article 3 of the constitution which sets out in detail the firm wish of the irish people the irish nation to have a united ireland albeit in the conditions set out very clearly in the article on consent as president i will foster an inclusive and open dialogue across the island in a manner that highlights and recognises our similarities and respects our differences i want to acknowledge our large and growing diaspora there is hardly a family on this island that does not have a personal experience of migration on every continent our emigrants have put their ingenuity and hard work at the service of new homelands yet they have kept their love of ireland and its culture deep in their hearts i hope over the next 7 years that there will be many opportunities for me to celebrate with them and share our experiences i have never believed more in the spirit of this country having travelled the length and breadth of the island i have witnessed it in every county in every corner of ireland i have heard it in the music the literature and the dance of our people in the deep tradition of solidarity and decency that continues to be the dominant force behind our people i have felt it in the quiet dignity and stoicism of those who simply keep going despite the very real challenges that they face is sibhse muintir na tre cosmhuintir na tre a casadh orm agus m ar fud na tre a spreag m agus a spreag mfhoireann le linn an fheachtais sibhse a chuaigh agus a thann i ngleic

    "deception what is deception according to the cambridge dictionary deception is the act of hiding the truth especially to gain an advantage in the world we live in where we are kept ignorant by the established control structures we are deceived all the time in order to place our trust in them they find and use new ways to deceive us all the time their aim of course is to keep us ignorant in order to manipulate us without our knowledge to achieve their agenda whatever that may be the greatest deception was carried out by the master of deception satan himself the greatest trick the devil ever pulled was to convince the world that he doesnt exist ignorance is bliss knowledge is power if a person has cancer and does not know it then the cancer will eventually result in definite death if that same person became aware of the cancer then at least there is a fighting chance that the cancer will be defeated the world today is suffering so many issues are running unabated due to our ignorance the wars are a significant cause for the climate change we see and we are distracted with replacing gas gazzling vehicles the political class is empowered simply to keep us distracted by whatever means possible democracy is a system which gives the illusion of self determination and control while in reality we see that it does nothing for the people who are duped by elections the status quo carries on or becomes much worse and the cycle continues who benefits just as satan has greater power when he is believed to be imaginary the servants of satan also use deception to empower themselves for the sole purpose elevating themselves above the rest how they benefit depends on what their objective is the war mongers get more war the power hungry get more power the greedy take more the system they have worked tirelessly to impose on us in secret over centuries had reached the pinnacle of operation humanity is enslaved by invisible shackles and kept distracted so that true freedom is always out of reach like a hamster in a wheel humanity is kept in this situation of subservience why true freedom would mean that humanity would become much greater than it currently is our limits would extend beyond this planet all problems would be solved there would be no hunger there would be no suffering there would be no inequality no illness no conflict how throughout time since the dawn of creation there has been a battle a struggle light vs darkness the prince of darkness had always had an agenda to prove to the source of light god it relates to the real story of creation and adam pbuh when god had placed the soul within the physical body of adam and commanded the angels to prostrate to him one stood tall a refused since then he satan has been on a mission to prove that his creation mankind was unworthy of being submitted to despite there being a soul within from god god is the finest of planners it was always gods plan to overcome the satanic agenda light was always going to defeat darkness this plan always revolved around the very same concept god always blew his spirit in to one man a man who represents god in every day and age all creation would submit to this man who carried the will of god today that man is calling the world to support him against the satanic agenda he had come with the will of god he is empowered by it it has been ordained that this man will be victorious where no man had before darkness will fall at his feet deception will end when this man the riser of the family of muhammad establishes the kingdom of heaven on earth justice and peace will be implemented all problems will be solved no human will go hungry no animals will suffer the climate will return to good health all illnesses will be cured development will accelerate beyond imagination space will be attainable to the masses not just the privileged the only requirement is acceptance and support will you accept the leadership of truth will you support he who is empowered by god to guide what would you give to see the world fixed on every level",

    "understanding your ideal body weight maintaining a healthy weight is one of the most important aspects of overall wellness but what exactly is your ideal weight its not about fitting into a specific number its about achieving the right balance between body composition health and lifestyle in this post well explore how gender age height and even lifestyle or location influence your ideal weight and how to find the number that truly reflects your healthiest self 1 what is ideal body weight the ideal body weight ibw is a theoretical value used to estimate the healthiest weight for a person based on their height gender and body composition its commonly used in medicine and fitness to assess whether a persons weight is within a healthy range though it should be viewed as a guideline not a strict rule popular formulas for ibw include devine formula most used men 50 kg 23 kg for each inch over 5 feet women 455 kg 23 kg for each inch over 5 feet men 480 kg 27 kg per inch over 5 feet women 455 kg 22 kg per inch over 5 feet example for a woman 55 tall 455 23 5 57 kg approx 125 lbs 2 how gender affects ideal weight biological differences between men and women naturally influence weight men typically have more muscle mass and less body fat their healthy weight range is usually higher for the same height women naturally have more body fat especially around the hips and thighs for hormonal and reproductive health their healthy weight range is slightly lower for the same height note this doesnt mean one gender is healthier than the other just that body composition varies 3 the role of age in ideal weight as we age our metabolism and muscle mass change which affects how our body stores and burns fat younger adults 1830 generally have higher metabolism and muscle tone ideal weight tends to be leaner middle age 3050 muscle mass gradually declines body fat tends to increase especially around the abdomen older adults 50 a slightly higher weight can sometimes be protective maintaining muscle strength and mobility becomes more important than the scale number 4 how location lifestyle affect weight where you live and how you live can influence your ideal weight range due to diet climate and daily activity by region or climate tropical regions diets are lighter often plantbased average healthy weights are slightly lower cold climates people may naturally maintain a bit more body fat for warmth and energy storage by lifestyle active lifestyles farmers athletes laborers more muscle mass higher ideal weight sedentary jobs office workers lower muscle mass lower healthy weight range example two people of the same height can have a 510 kg difference in ideal weight depending on muscle density and activity levels 5 bmi a useful but limited tool bmi body mass index is widely used to estimate healthy weight ranges based on height and weight bmi formula textbmi fractextweight kgtextheight m2 bmi categories category bmi range underweight below 185 normal weight 185 249 overweight 25 299 obesity 30 and above however bmi doesnt account for muscle mass bone density or fat distribution so its not always accurate for athletes or elderly individuals 6 how to maintain your ideal weight once you know your healthy range the goal is to maintain it through balanced habits practical tips eat whole nutrientdense foods focus on lean proteins vegetables and whole grains exercise regularly combine cardio strength training and flexibility exercises monitor progress weigh yourself occasionally but dont obsess stay hydrated and sleep well manage stress chronic stress can affect hormones that control appetite and fat storage consistency and balance matter more than perfection 7 key takeaway your ideal weight depends on multiple factors gender age height activity level and even your environment instead of chasing a number aim for the weight where you feel energetic strong and healthy the best weight is the one that supports your longterm wellbeing physically mentally and emotionally",

    "test summary is at the top would love to hear all of your views on this one this one is longer because there was quite a bit of contradictory information and controversial views on her so i wanted to capture her in full february 3 1821 may 31 1910 the first woman to formally become a doctor in the modern western era the first women to earn a formal medical degree in the usa and the first woman to be listed on the british medical register a founder of the first womens hospital and the first womens medical university in both the usa and england she was also a woman of seeming contradictions she believed that most women were not welleducated enough to have a political voice but she fought to get more education for women she was anticontraception and antivaccine but she was a pioneer in sex education she was horrified by the idea of abortion deeming it a gross perversion and destruction of motherhood but she encouraged women to focus on their career and passions rather than marrying she didnt originally want to be a doctor but she wanted women to have the right to be a doctor and she was appalled that the term female physician at the time was used only to refer to abortionists she entertained romantic attractions but she was intentional not to marry this is her story elizabeth was born february 3 1821 in an old gabled house at counterslip near bristol england she was the third of nine children 5 girls 2 older and 4 boys her parents were quakers and politically liberal yet socially conservative abolitionists rare for the time her father provided an excellent home education for his girls with private tutors and a governess and instilled in them progressive views on social issues and elizabeth developed a love of reading at a young age her family is reported to have ardently been opposed to slavery even though her father one of bristols leading businessmen was a refiner of slaveproduced sugar the blackwell children took it upon themselves to give up sugar consumption an antislavery strategy that was practiced widely in 1832 when elizabeth was 11 her fathers sugar refinery in bristol burned down and they immigrated to the usa settling in new york to seek better economic opportunities and more social freedom in the usa young elizabeth displayed unusual academic talents read voraciously learned french and german became proficient in music dabbled in art and enjoyed frequent romantic attachments in new york the family became actively involved in the abolitionist movement and elizabeth attended antislavery meetings and participated in fundraising events in 1835 the family moved from new york to jersey city new jersey and in 1838 her father moved the blackwells moved to cincinnati ohio to pursue a venture in beat sugar production as an alternate means to slave produced cane sugar but within two months of their arrival in cincinnati when elizabeth was 17 her father aged 38 died of malaria leaving the family penniless during the height of a national financial crisis off to work in the antebellum period teaching was one of the only career paths available to women so elizabeth her 2 older sisters and her mother began working as teachers to support the family in 1844 she took a teaching job in kentucky where she witnessed the horrors of slavery firsthand she returned to cincinnati after only six months and vowed to find some way to make the world a better place she then continued teaching in cincinnati but her life bored her and she longed for some supreme challenge that would help make a difference the start of a dream in 1845 she went to see mary donaldson a family friend dying of what was probably uterine cancer my friend blackwell later recalled died of a painful disease the delicate nature of which made the methods of treatment a constant suffering to her a lady doctor donaldson told her young visitor would have spared her the embarrassment of having male physicians examine her you are fond of study elizabeth said the dying woman you have health leisure and a cultivated intelligence why dont you study medicine elizabeth was originally repelled by the idea as she noted in her journal she loved the world of literature and philosophy and beauty not the grim discipline of science i hated everything connected with the body and could not bear the sight of a medical book my favourite studies were history and metaphysics and the very thought of dwelling on the physical structure of the body and its various ailments filled me with disgust yet she could not put the wild notion out of her mind donaldson said to me that she knew a woman doctor would have known what to do to save her that gave me pause becoming a doctor wasnt exactly what i had in mind after watching her suffer so badly i knew someone must step forward and make a difference every close friend tried to dissuade her blackwell was not discouraged by this advice rather she wrote the idea of winning a doctors degree gradually assumed the aspect of a great moral struggle and the moral fight possessed immense attraction for me soon her determination to become a medical doctor became an obsession which then became a dream to be a surgeon she pursued her impossible dream for several reasons 1 she was inspired by the challenge and the opportunities for service in a medical career 2 she was at heart a reformer and eager to increase opportunities for women 3 she possessed a powerful intellect 4 and she feared her romantic nature might lead her to an early marriage that would stifle her intellectual growth an 1846 diary entry confirms her fear of mental stagnation i felt more determined than ever to become a physician and thus place a strong barrier between me and all ordinary marriage i must have something to engross my thoughts preparing for medical school there were few medical colleges at the time in general and none that accepted women a few women had apprenticed and became unlicensed physicians but elizabeth insisted on getting a formal degree though she had no money for medical school even if she was accepted but she was determined to find a way she took teaching jobs under doctors to save money for medical school tuition in exchange for room and board and access to their medical libraries but these positions were in the south under slave owners the first was under a minister and former doctor in asheville north carolina dr john dickson he boarded her and gave her full use of his medical library in exchange she taught at his school for girls working there 10 or 12 hours a day while working at the female seminary in asheville blackwell began offering sunday school literacy lessons to enslaved people this was illegal until dr john dickson stopped her efforts when the school closed a year later she looked for a similar situation which she quickly found in johns brother dr samuel dickson in charlotte south carolina he also boarded her and let her spend every available hour in his medical library and gave her some elementary instruction sam dickson is known for his proslavery writings in which he expressed beliefs in polygenesis the separate evolution of races and the idea that africans were particularly suited to slavery and the southern climate in her journal elizabeth wrote being this face to face with slavery was almost more than she could bare but this access was crucial for her premedical studies as formal education for women in medicine was virtually nonexistent at the time she decided that becoming a doctor was the most important path based on her values getting into medical school by early summer of 1847 she had enough money and enough selfacquired knowledge to move on to the next step applying for entrance to medical school she went first to philadelphia whose four medical colleges were among the nations finest she was rejected by all of them several suggested that her only hope might be to go to paris disguise herself as a man and try for entrance there she defied convention ill not go in disguise she said ill make my way as a woman although one adviser warned her against going to paris because it was a city of sin and degradation if the path of duty led to hell elizabeth replied i would go there still hoping to gain acceptance at an american school she tried again and again elizabeth blackwell was rejected by 29 medical schools before being accepted into geneva medical college in 1847 a struggling little school as a practical joke elizabeth had won the support of a prominent dr warrington who sent a letter of recommendation to the dean of geneva for elizabeth the dean and his faculty unwilling to take full responsibility for offending dr warrington turned the matter over to the 150 male students if even 1 student voted no elizabeth would be rejected thinking it was a joke they all voted yes columbia would not admit female students to its medical school for another 70 years medical school elizabeth blackwell arrived at geneva on november 6 1847 and soon found herself a pariah in that little new york community professors forced her to sit separately at lectures and often excluded her from labs local townspeople shunned her as a bad woman for defying her gender role she couldnt find living space because apartment managers refused to rent to her believing in 1847 that only a mad or bad woman would try to become a doctor although she had joined her class late she caught up rapidly studying far into the night to earn the highest grades possible she starved herself in those early weeks at geneva partly because she had little money for food and partly to keep her cheeks pale so that she would be less likely to blush in a delicate class discussion of anatomy her professor first asked that she absent herself from any anatomy lab which might prove embarrassing for mixed company but she politely demanded the right to attend all such sessions and was eventually allowed to her journal entry of november 22 1847 casts some light on the private war she was waging that dissection was just as much as i could bearmy delicacy was certainly shockedi had to pinch my hand till the blood nearly came and call on christ to help me from smiling when the first term at geneva ended in january she applied for practical experience internship in several hospitals but each refused her finally philadelphias blockley almhouse an infirmary for the poor accepted her and she was assigned to the ward for female victims of venereal disease officials refused to call her an intern even though male medical students had the title doctors at blockley almshouse tried to sabotage blackwell theyd neglect to make diagnosis cards for the patients on purpose to shake her confidence blackwell was undeterred instead she looked at their nastiness as an opportunity it meant id have to figure out what was wrong without the doctors help she said later it pushed me way ahead again miss blackwells delicate sensibilities received a shock as much as she had studied she was not prepared for these horrors her introduction to the hideousness of modern fornication and its results led to a lifelong battle against venereal disease and the white slave traffic white slave is an archaic historical term for the sexual exploitation and forced prostitution of women and girls particularly associated with the early 20thcentury panic about the forced recruitment of white often immigrant women into prostitution sex trafficking of white women the moral panic surrounding white slavery in the us led to the passage of the whiteslave traffic act of 1910 commonly known as the mann act while intended to address forced prostitution the laws ambiguous language immoral purposes was disproportionately used to prosecute black people and racial minorities for consensual relationships with white women effectively policing black mobility and sexuality across state lines resident physicians and interns at blockley almshouse of course made her life there difficult they snubbed her openly and refused to enter diagnosis and treatment information on patients charts while she was in attendance even some of her patients resented her presence one destitute woman told her i may be poor and cast out by the lord into a paupers bed but ill have no woman to take care of me in my illness elizabeth graduated top of her class on january 23 1849 for her graduation she raided her dwindling savings to buy a black silk dress so that she might be a credit to my college and my sex she was now dr elizabeth blackwell md the first formal female medical doctor in the west public backlash her success caused outrage within the maledominated medical community geneva medical college immediately shut its doors to women following elizabeths graduation for over a decade in later years genevas colleges greatest claim to fame was its pioneering acceptance of the first woman into medical education the powersthatbe declared her a freak whose unnatural example ought not to be followed by other women the boston medical and surgical journal expressed regret that she had been led to aspire to honors and duties which by the order of nature and the common consent of the world devolve upon men britains humor magazine mocked her as well in rhyme secretly pleased over the attention showered on her she noted the press comments in her journal starting her career but the doors to her chosen profession remained as tightly closed as before unable to find a hospital that would permit her to gain clinical experience either in the united states or england she finally applied to paris famed lyingin hospital la maternite blackwell was accepted at la maternite in paris the biggest maternity hospital in the world there was one condition she could do the work of a doctor but she would not be called a doctor her family argued against it but blackwell insisted ill see more of one part of medicine in the three months there than id see in 10 years anywhere else she vowed there she entered midwife training on the same footing as any illiterate girl angry humiliated but still as determined as ever she bolstered her resolve with a journal entry work on elizabeth la maternite an ancient convent converted to hospital use treated its students much like the nuns of earlier centuries confined within its walls for weeks at a time elizabeth blackwell loved her rare free days roaming the streets of paris and surrounding herself with the beauty of luxembourg gardens a dream interrupted it was at la maternite that she suffered a catastrophe which threatened to end her medical career before it began her journal describes the tragic incident while treating an infant with conjunctivitis some of the water spurted into her own eye within hours her left eye had swollen shut and soon both eyes were sightless months of torture followed physicians at last removed her left eye and sight slowly returned to the other she wore a prosthetic eye for the rest of her life officials said her injury prevented her from becoming a surgeon yet blackwell remained focused i have my health brains and stubbornness ill journey a different way continuing on ever since her girlhood days in cincinnati when she became a close friend of harriet beecher stowe elizabeth blackwell exhibited a remarkable ability to meet and impress prominent people fun fact elizabeth blackwell and lady anne isabella noel byron ada lovelaces mom were friends and allies in their support for womens rights and education blackwell sought out lady byron as a patron and received her intellectual and philosophical support particularly regarding womens rights and the education of women physicians one such prominent friend was a highly respected male doctor who became sympathetic with her desire for more clinical experience he helped dr blackwell gain an unprecedented entry into st bartholomews hospital in london during the winter of 185051 after completing her internship at st bartholomews she decided to return to america in 1851 confident that she could now begin her medical practice launching her career but every effort to gain a hospital staff position in new york city met with scornful rebuff if dr blackwell was to practice medicine in new york she would have to do it alone so she began a private practice renting rooms at 44 university place across the hudson in jersey city she hung out her shingle and waited for patients to appear but she wrote later patients came very slowlyi had no medical companionship the profession stood aloof and society was distrustful of the innovation slowly success came dr blackwell was groundbreaking in her emphasis of preventative care and hygiene she had observed in her internships that male doctors often caused the spread of epidemics by failing to wash their hands between patients which highlighted the critical importance of sanitation seeking family reared in a large family and accustomed to having friends around her dr blackwell found those early years of new york practice among the loneliest of her life by this time she knew she would never marry so in 1854 at age 33 she decided to adopt a child the randalls island orphanage had several hundred waifs longing for a home but one bedraggled 7yearold named katherine barry captured her heart at first glance kitty as she became known from that time forward filled the emptiness in elizabeths life writing to a friend about the adoption she explained i have recognized the truth of this part of my nature and the necessity of satisfying its wants that i may be calm and free for the wider work her adoring kitty remained at her side until her death in 1910 a span of fiftysix years meanwhile elizabeth had been studying her younger sister emily decided to follow in her sisters footsteps and become a doctor emily was rejected by 12 medical schools including elizabeths alma mater before being accepted by rush college in chicago where she was only allowed to study for a year she was later accepted by case western reserve university in cleveland ohio where she graduated with honors in 1854 was able to gain entrance to the western reserve university medical school in cleveland and become americas second female physician in 1854 after additional study in scotland she joined her sister in her new york practice in 1856 that same year dr marie zackrzewska whom elizabeth had encouraged to take up medical studies at western reserve joined the sisters as well marie became blackwells ardent disciple as she later wrote in her autobiography on our delightful long walks on weehawken heights she was the speaker and her reasoning was so sound her determination so firm her love for humanity so true that she seemed to me a prophet of no ordinary insight and foresight a new beginning in may 1857 the intrepid trio rented a house at 64 bleecker street in a new york slum and launched the new york infirmary for women and children it was an exciting concept a hospital for women staffed entirely by women blackwell added a feature to her new york infirmary for women and children that no other hospital could claim an outpatient department to take care of her typically poor patients after they went home this new hospital provided poor women and children with quality medical care and gave female doctors and medical students a safe place to learn and practice medicine but nothing came easily for the new project many people still mistrusted lady doctors and they frequently spread gossip about the morals of these brazen women who defied the laws of nature despite public opposition to the idea of a hospital run entirely by women it became a big success expaning in england in 1859 elizabeth blackwell traveled to london to be the first woman registered with the united kingdoms medical register a feat achieved because the medical act of 1858 recognized doctors with foreign degrees her trip was also to lecture on the importance of women in medicine and she sought to start a parallel medical infirmary in britain during this visit she began discussions with reformer barbara bodichon and was introduced to elizabeth garrett anderson elizabeth garrett was an eager listener at one of blackwells 1859 london addresses miss garrett later became englands first female medical school graduate and a cofounder of londons new hospital for women garretts first impressions of elizabeth she looked like a demure little quaker in her plain bonnet and simple gray silkthe features framed by the blonde graying hair looked drawn and colorlessbut from the first word in the low resonant voice the first gesture of the slender expressive hands the girl was held captive civil war when the civil war broke out in 1861 there was a huge surge of women volunteering to help the war effort by raising money making supplies and nursing elizabeth recognized the incredible potential of all this enthusiasm and set out to organize and professionalize these efforts she founded the womens central association of relief wcar on april 25 1861 the wcar had three goals 1 to organize womens charity efforts and promote the creation of more 2 establish a working relationship with the us military so they could directly respond to the changing needs of the army 3 to select and train women as professional nurses who could be hired to work in military hospitals the education and training of women nurses was especially important to elizabeth she believed the war was an opportunity for women to assert themselves as respectable medical professionals dorothea dix was a medical activist like elizabeth but she thought that nursing was a natural extension of womens domestic responsibilities she believed nurses should be volunteers not paid professionals like elizabeth wanted dorotheas vision was more appealing to male organizers who wanted to preserve male dominance in the medical field dorothea was known for her strict rigid standards for nurses requiring them to be plainlooking single women between the ages of 35 and 50 and wear modest clothing her goal was to ensure moral integrity and avoid potential conflict with male doctors who resented the presence of women in military hospitals in june of 1861 the us government established the us sanitary commission ussc a private agency that would oversee all efforts to support wounded and sick soldiers appointed dorothea to be the superintendent of women nurses elizabeth and the wcar were sidelined because their vision of professionalizing womens work was deemed too radical even with this setback they continued to work with the ussc to improve conditions and provide relief at the war front expansion after the war elizabeth continued to promote the inclusion of women in medicine she established the womens medical college at the new york infirmary in 1867 her school was groundbreaking because it provided a place where women could get a comprehensive medical education without encountering constant prejudice and resistance the college required a fouryear course of study at a time when other medical colleges required only one year elizabeth and emily intended to offer an education that surpassed the standards at mens colleges making the fouryear curriculum an intentional and higher educational standard the new york infirmary hospital and college operated for more than a century her hospital up and running blackwell moved back to london in 1869 to continue the efforts to persuade medical schools to open their doors to women emily blackwell soon took over as the guiding force of the womens hospital in new york soon marie zackrzewska left too to open a womens hospital in boston back in london through the 1870s dr blackwell continued to rally support in great britain for acceptance of women in medicine on all hands we make converts she wrote triumphantly to emily and those who are indoctrinated make converts elizabeth blackwell sophia jexblake and elizabeth garrett anderson founded the london school of medicine for women in 1874 women were still denied entry into british medical schools at the time dr blackwell proudly accepted the chair of hygiene in the new medical school and worked as a professor of gynecology there until she retired in 1907 like sister school the course of study was much more rigorous than in most medical schools of the day and its graduates were turning doubters into believers medical education would never again be the same activism sex education there was still more pioneering ahead for dr elizabeth blackwell in countless public lectures she had shocked victorians by urging young ladies to learn more about their bodies and how to care for them in 1876 she wrote a treatise on a very forbidden subject sex education and titled it counsel to parents on the moral education of their children in relation to sex she submitted it to twelve different london publishers all of whom recoiled in horror from the subject matter and refused to print it but a courageous editor at hatchard and co london at last agreed to publish the explosive book no sooner had the manuscript been set in type however when the widow of the late bishop a late senior editor of the firm read the proofs and heaved them into the fire it was not until 1879 that the book was published both in london and new york with reaction ranging from outrage to cautious approbation dr blackwell did not actively practice medicine during the final two decades of her life but she was a tireless worker for a score of causes womens suffrage better hygiene the abolition of prostitution and white slavery morality in government and the liberalization of victorian prudery among others the liberalization of victorian prudery meant challenging the strict often hypocritical social norms surrounding discussions of sexuality and the body by advocating for sex education such topics were considered highly inappropriate for polite society and battling the sexual double standard she campaigned against the prevailing double standard where men could engage in sexual activity with few social or legal repercussions while women particularly those involved in prostitution faced severe condemnation and punitive measures like the contagious diseases acts but when it comes to elizabeths legacy as a victorian feminist she had contradictory views elizabeth didnt support the contemporary womens rights movements and believed that most women were not welleducated enough to have a political voice she was anticontraception and antivaccine she was also horrified by the idea of abortion deeming it a gross perversion and destruction of motherhood final years she wrote i am glad that i and not another have to bear this pioneer work i understand now why this life has never been lived before i would like a little fun now and then my life is altogether too sober she set up court at her home rock house at hastings england receiving a stream of prominent visitors from all over europe and america at 85 she was strong enough to make one last visit to america to see her family and visit her hospital in 1907 elizabeth blackwell was seriously injured when she fell down a flight of stairs while on vacation in scotland this fall resulted in a head injury that permanently impaired her mental and physical faculties she never recovered she died on may 31 1910 in hastings england at age 89 after suffering a paralytic stroke she was buried in kilmun scotland at st munns parish church graveyard because she had a strong fondness for the area after spending holidays there and specified it as her burial place in her will her legacy her battle had not been completely won but her successes had been monumental she had won the enthusiastic support of some prominent medical figuresand the grudging acceptance of women into medicine when she died at hastings on may 31 1910 a total of 7399 women had become licensed physicians and surgeons approximately 6 of the field in the united states today women account for approximately 36 to 38 of all active physicians and about 50 of medical students in the usa in 1958 hobart and william smith colleges established the elizabeth blackwell award for outstanding service to mankind the serious young rebel in the quaker bonnet is ranked among americas most honored medical pioneers my whole life is devoted unreservedly to the service of my sex the study and practice of medicine is in my thought but one

let us know if he contacts you you will cooperate in any operation designed to capture him is that understood the chairwoman stood straighter as she stared at the hologram she would have liked to conduct this meeting in person but the new acting un president of earth was adamant that he not need to leave the planet she already disliked him that sounds an awful lot like you trying to give me orders she said which seems rather interesting considering that the ga is not beholden to any one entity the mans face was morphing into a redder tone a color changing power she had noticed only in lighter colored humans made it easy to tell he was angry listen here you little sh ahem the ga and the un have a common interest in staying friendly to each other admiral vir committed treason and is a danger to us both you will help us to capture him and if you do he will be extradited back to earth am i understood she ground one of her knuckles into the floor and then pushed her weight onto her back feet to stand like the humans did it was a difficult almost acrobatic ability she had acquired over her tenure at almost six feet tall standing on all fours she could add more than a foot balancing on her back legs she had to think through this logically personally she did not trust the man he was anti alliance and had proven himself to be easy to anger and combative in most situations he was not someone she wanted to work with her intelligence analysts had been attempting to gather information on hunt since kellys death and there was plenty of information that inclined her to dislike him not to mention that there was some small connection between him and one of admiral virs attempted assassinations seemed odd that he would lose the popular vote but suddenly become president when kelly was murdered some called that a conspiracy but she wasnt willing to rule it out what was her play the ga was already dangerously on its way to being fractured both humans and celzex were threatening to pull out of the alliance as were the drev if the humans were to pull out all of their economies were likely to crash it was her hope that president hunt was now utterly aware of this he may have started his campaign as an isolationist but at this point he was probably coming to learn that the last two un presidents had done a good job intertwining their political wellbeing with those of everyone else in the galaxy we will be on the lookout for his ship and any communications he may attempt to make with previous contacts she said rather diplomatically while she intended to keep an eye out for him it was because she wanted to talk with him face to face herself and had absolutely no intention of trying to imprison him as her first strategy soemthing didnt seem right and she would rather have all the facts first the man grunted good and then he just hung up she would have said it was rude and been miffed about it but honestly he was an incorrigible person and she was glad that he hung up she slumped back onto her front limbs and sighed things were all falling apart not for the rundi or the tesraki luckily enough but the rest of the galaxy was reeling from news of the makers and leaked information on celzex capabilities there were outcries everywhere to demand justice from them which was completely ridiculous since the celzex were capable of blowing up their star if they tried hard enough she tilted her head to look up through one of the skylights past gently blowing blue sand and a green expanse beyond that adam i sure hope there is a good explanation for all of this he sat in his office on the omen surrounded by relics of the past the room hadnt been touched since he was labeled a traitor and a turncoat it still had his military commendations on the wall still hung with the un flag and even contained a climatecontrolled glass case with his four star dress uniform complete with epaulettes cords gloves hat and so on it took all that he had to even be able to sit in this room in his hands he held a picture it was an old image though you wouldnt have thought so the colors were just as vibrant and alive as they had been on that day during the academy when he had first met kelly in person they stood side by side in the picture shaking hands he as per usual had a goofy grin on his face to match his lanky and ungainly body captain kelly still managed to stay cool and composed though he fancied that he could see a small smile hovering at the corner of her lips how much he missed her her death had been like losing a close family member she had been his mentor his champion his friend he would even go as far as to say another one of his adoptive mothers kelly had always backed him up during the hard times supported his decisions and created an environment for the unsc to work in that was both productive and strict in a perfect balance she had known what her men needed and she had done it right she would have made a great president he was sure of it but now she was gone and he was on the run from the law what times they were having he sat the image on his desk and slumped back into his seat staring at it wish you were here now maybe you would be able to tell me how to go about this he sighed and closed his eyes trying to imagine what she would say to him he cracked an eye after a moment looking at her picture you would know why i did this i am sure of it you would tell me that there is nothing i can do about the past what is done is done while we can learn from past military actions we must face where to go on the future he paused and frowned sounded like soemthing kelly might say it was smart and she had been smart either that or he was just kidding himself after a moment of thought he chose not to believe that he leaned forward in his seat you would tell me to stop ruminating and get my head in the game as of now i am the only thing that is standing between humanity and the void whether they know it or not he was nodding to himself it had been almost a month since kellys death a month of being racked with grief and anger and internal crisis one after the other last night he hadnt been able to sleep left sunny alone in their room and came here to order his thoughts but something something had changed inside him he was still angry and sad but as he looked at her image he didnt feel the guilt so commonly associated with his personality this was not his fault he had done everything he could what sunnys mother had done had been a play out of left field and there was no way he could have stopped it there were plenty of things in the universe he couldnt control most things actually he was one man and the universe was vast and he would be lucky if he could completely control the actions of his own crew so why was he constantly punishing himself for things that were out of his scope answer no reason the only thing in the makers glowing universe that he could control was himself and instead of doing that he had been sitting there for the last month moping no no that was still self blame it was ok to grieve but now now was the time for actions now he was done grieving and ruminating and sitting there thinking about how things could be different whether or not it was ideal he now had an opportunity to do something of real value he could follow what he thought was right regardless of orders he was a free agent and for the first time in his life he could do what he wanted however he wanted he could focus on what was important and damn the rest sitting there in his office with only a picture of kelly for company that sudden realization hit him like a ton of bricks and when the bricks passed on the tide he felt a welling inside him a sudden change in the way that he thought like chains were snapping away and allowing him to rise to his feet it was the most liberating feeling he had ever experienced he stood unable to stay down as his body felt buoyed up by helium this was it there in that room he threw off the mantle of grief like a cloak and marched out into the hallway head up and a smile on his face an expression that hadnt graced him in a while his first mission breakfast when he walked into the mess hall he was not surprised to find he wasnt the only one up the room was packed with plenty of human and drev crew members alike quietly sitting at tables and clustered in small groups talking quietly he walked over to the breakfast bar hunting for some pancakes when a familiar face showed itself at the edge of his vision standing close to him in pretense of getting pancakes himself though adam knew better he turned on the spot eyebrow raised as he looked over at ramirez the man had taken to being a pirate better than the rest of them and used the opportunity to dress like one or so he said he wore his standard issue unsc acu pants with calf high black combat boots and no shirt to speak of though he had thrown on some pulse armor for his wrists and one shoulder like some sort of fantasy barbarian adam had no doubt the ensemble was intended to show off his admittedly adonislike physique ever since that time they trained with the spartans ramirez admittedly already great physique had improved even more adam rolled his eyes would it kill you to wear a shirt ramirez narrowed his eyes at adam he had allowed his hair to grow out from regulation length allowing his unruly curls to sprout in perfect disorder on the top of his head it was a look that worked well even with the dumb pirate outfit and adam was annoyed to find he was mildly jealous im worried about you ramirez began adam felt a smile creeping onto his face ramirez frowned upon seeing it i wanted to ask if you were ok this time adam couldnt hold back a smile as he pulled his friend closer and wrapped an arm around his shoulder honestly ive never been better it is a matter of perspective really upgrades ramirez upgrades he said turning the two of them towards the room and out past the view screen and the stars beyond ramirez didnt look convinced wait are you serious their conversation had attracted eyes around the room and the curious crew members peeked curiously at them from their seats at nearby tables neither adam nor ramirez were known for having quiet voices so their conversation wasnt hard to overhear but that was fine let them overhear yes im doing well i had a realization this morning go on ramirez urged his own curiosity peaking adam looked around the room at the waiting eyes and in them he saw hope or if not hope but the hope for hope the way they leaned forward in their seats told him a story about their dejection and sadness just as deep as his own they were looking for something he had only just found he made an executive decision taking a step upward onto one of the tables grabbing everyones attention now below him ramirez was frowning alright boys girls and those in between whether you are human or drev listen up as i sat in my office this morning i had a realization he said his voice loud enough to address the whole room one that i hope you will be able to share with me he looked around making eye contact with everyone in the room we cant change the past we cant expect ourselves to be able to predict the future but right now we have soemthing that we have never had before an opportunity they were eager for his words leaning forward in their seats freeedoooom he let it sit on the air for a moment and before you ask yes that was a reference but not only that its also a fact we now have utter freedom freedom to conduct ourselves however we want and whenever we want with no rules other than the ones we make for ourselves we have the ability to dictate what we think is important and act on it without rules without regulations without politics he felt his smile growing kazna may have taken almost everything from us but i know there is one thing she has given me they waited and he let the silence drag out for a moment she gave me a purpose their eyes were intent on him as he spoke for the past couple years we have been doing what generally taking care of the universe and doing some exploring but what else was there there was no purpose there was no drive other than to follow orders and do a good job well now now i say we have a real purpose and i hope maybe the rest of you will agree and align yourselves with me when i saw my purpose is to find kazna shove her body up the voids you know where and use their rolled up bodies to go bowling in hell his strange and rather awkward metaphor got laughs out of the group of them and even a few cheers i will protect and defend humanity and this galaxy until there is no more breath in my body his voice was rising fists were thrown into the air whooping and whistling and cheering he grinned allowing the cheers to die down and since we are pirates now i have a rule i would like to change they quieted cool pirate outfits are now mandatory i will leave that definition up to you but if we are going to be pirates then we are going to look damn good doing it none of that standard uniform shit anymore anyone who wears lame stuff will totally be expelled from the ship unless lame or standard look is what youre going for of course but what about casual tuesday and friday pajama evenings those will stay of course another wave of cheering from one side though the other side of mostly more than 6 ft tall multihanded crewmates seemed to not be that on board yet multiple clawed hands went up in the air to raise questions adam sighed so pirates are cannon interrupted him quite instantly we do know what pirates are and how they look there were plenty of great movies about these mighty warriors and their honor code at the weekly movie evening oh right yeah so why the questions cannon did the equivalent of a chuckle you did notice we drev dont wear clothes right and quite frankly eyepatches would hinder us more in battle than anything else hmmm good point i mean you dont have to do anything differently if now it was nairobis turn to chime in adam if i may headwear wouldnt be that much of a hindrance right headbands scarves around the head etc you can still be creative that seemed to get some of the drev on board cannon now lost in thought mumbled to himself note to self get me one of those cool big pirate hats like captain barbarossa through the crowd of mixed opinion drev dzara made her way forward walking upright and without pain due to the help of the braces but angrily trying to find her way to the front until she was finally close to adam no guys listen to me you dont get it the room quieted again consider the following badass warpaint or like scary face paint on our beaks the drev all looked at each other that was something totally new in their culture and something most of them hadnt thought of yet before this moment the whole drev crowd erupted in even louder cheers than the humans now and just like that it had been decided and everyone was on board with it adam was just standing there a smile on his lips seeping in the joy of the crowd until another person cleared her throat loudly most of them turned to see an angry simon standing in the doorway her pristine uniform kept exactly and perfectly to unsc regulation as much as could be jeffery the only pet allowed on the ship except waffles was resting on her shoulders admiral didnt you forget something adam smiled sheepishly alright alright listen up people also alien pets are totally allowed now because who the hell is going to stop us even more cheering well since we already started with multiple rule changes lets keep going since we arent part of the unsc anymore i dont have to follow the regulations openly or in private so crew fraternization is above board get out there you crazy kids i know you know we have all been doing it mostly me but now i dont have to pretend to give a shit this one definitely caused even more cheering from the human side the noise had drawn other members of the crew from deeper in the ship and he could see them clustering at the entryways waiting and watching he would come up with more cool pirate rules later and waved the group of them off as he stepped down from the table a figure standing off to the side caught his attention and he turned to look over at maverick who was standing by one of the doors a small smile on the corner of her mouth she was wearing sweatpants and an oversized long sleeve shirt and a beanie he hadnt seen her for what felt like weeks ramirez had told him she was fine enough but he was sure the loss of her job couldnt have been easy everything she knew and believed had turned out to be a lie her post as ship chaplain was pointless now he could see where she would have gotten lost he walked over to her as the others celebrated ramirez on his heels you doing alright he asked while she just smiled if your neurotic ass can be alright that so can i he held out a hand and she did too both gripping each other by the forearm and thats when he noticed metal he frowned and before she could move to stop him he grabbed her hand and turned it over where he found a thin exoskeleton moulded to her body se2 she was wearing the steel eye 2 armor he turned his head to look up at her eyes wide she sighed and rolled up her sleeves to show them the cage like exo structure look i wasnt sure how you were going to take it so thats why ive been avoiding you but now that i am no longer ship chaplain i thought might as well make myself useful and become heavy infantry he opened his mouth to chew her out tell her it was reckless and stupid but the hypocrisy of those words choked in his throat he understood it and for her the se2 wouldnt mean the same thing she didnt have the memories connected to it like he did she was going to be fine instead he smiled and looked at ramirez great now were all fucked dang it just when crew fraternization is finally openly allowed you become too heavy to sit on my face both adam and maverick rolled their eyes i could still hover doesnt mean i would ramirez chuckled aww shucks damn guess i have to find someone else from the crew to seduce then the three of them laughed again how is yours powered adam wondered looking at mavericks exoskeleton its a bit bulkier than yours especially in the legs and the arms uses the kinetic energy to power itself and some batteries on the backside to help out he nodded and clapped her on the shoulder as he stepped past you two get something to eat alight ill be with you in a minute and then he was heading towards another shape skulking in the doorway he reached out taking sunny by the hands forced to lean up on his toes to kiss her on the cheek he paused lingering there for a moment before dropping back onto his heels to look her in the eyes good morning my love how are you doing she did the drev equivalent of raising an eyebrow at him good morning he smiled join me for breakfast she blinked slowly at him it would be my pleasure he took her hand and walked back with her to the table where some of the others were waiting the room was alive with voices a new sense of purpose slowly spreading around the ship she squeezed his hand glad to have you back she said softly he smiled glad to be back previous first

    "new update myf17 church banned our youth worship leaderf20 for denouncing christian nationalism during service the rest of the band wants to stage a walkout the next time they play original post was made by uthrowrawalkaround when i reached out to oop for permission to post any updates to boru shortly after her first post was made to r relationships she asked if i could post her first post on her behalf to rtwohottakes because her attempt was picked up by the spam filter and her post to r relationships was removed i posted her first post to rtwohottakes on her behalf and she answered questions from her account when she made her update some time later she was able to post it to herself trigger warning religious excommunication religion and politics physical abuse mood spoiler sad but hopeful for the future of the kids original post july 9th 2024 my churchs youth group has a youth band that leads worship during youth but the church also has them lead worship on sunday mornings every few weeks to promote the youth band when the usual worship team has a week off im not in the band but i often help with lyric powerpoints along with another girl but not when the band plays on sundays the main singer of the youth band is the daughter of a youth assistant and the daughter is an assistant too well call her emma shes 20 im writing because of what happened the last time the youth band led sunday worship on 630 that led to emma and her family leaving the church inbetween one of the songs emma said she felt led to say that christian nationalism wasnt of god because forcing people to believe went against the basis of christianity because god gave free will and too many christians forgot that she also said there would be no short and narrow path if people were forced to walk it before saying project 2025 was advertised as christian but resembled nothing of god because god never forced people to believe in him no one confronted her or anything as it was brief and they played a few more songs along with the closing song after the pastor finished his sermon but when we got to youth on friday night emma and her mother werent there and we were later informed by the youth pastor that emma and her mom would no longer be helping the youth before a bunch of stuff about giving others the chance to be lead singers because emma had left the church however word got out from one of the bands players that emma told the band that she got banned during the week and that her parents left the church with her so they already knew before we found out at youth the reason im making this post is because of a conversation i had with the band and other powerpoint girl the same friday the youth pastor announced it and the conversation was private from the rest of the kids long story short the band is upset about what happened to emma and theyve been throwing around ideas on what to do the one theyre heavily considering is a walkout the next time theyre scheduled to play on sunday after playing the intro song service opens with an intro song before someone comes onstage to welcome everyone before worship continues and they would voice support for emma before walking out together they havent told anyone not associated with the band because they dont want anyone to spill the deets but the main thing were debating is repercussions from our parents and whether or not its worth the risk theres likely a few weeks until the band plays on sunday again and they still havent decided on a new lead singer yet i also wanna add that the church didnt upload the worship portion of the service with emma and only uploaded the sermon from that day they always include worship on their youtube upload of the service most of the concerns were around tuition punishments as some of them have their parents helping pay but they still want to do something and while im not in the band technically aside from coordinating powerpoint lyrics occasionally i figured the least i could do was get advice from other adults anonymously because we dont want to ask our parents for obvious reasons and maybe others could see more pros and cons that we can i appreciate any advice that anyone gives and will relay it to the band too thanks to anyone who read this too edit i forgot to add this detail in my post but the pastor of our church has used the pulpit to speak politics in the past and has even mentioned support of a presidential candidate on numerous occasions along with other political topics on occasion too roe v wade gay rights so while i agree that politics probably shouldnt be spoken in church some of the band said that emma was tired of the often political topics being brought up during sermons thus why she said what she said first update july 22nd 2024 i wanna thank everyone who commented on my original post because it was way more than i expected and many of you had really helpful advice this is a small update with some really surprising things that happened since first the band is still going through with the walkout and theyre keeping it within the band so that no other kids tell their parents who might tell leaders it wouldve been awesome to include others but the risk of the church catching wind was too great second we have a date of 84 when the youth band will do worship for the adults again third the youth pastor appointed a singer from within the group who will take turns singing on sundays with future participants in the coming weeks fourth the new singer agreed that the churchs handling of emma was bs fifth and most exciting two of the band members told nonreligious relatives about the situation and fear of punishment and they agreed to come to the service and let them head to their cars in the parking lot straight from the walkout for safety they wont leave the lot in case some parents try to claim kidnapping but well be in their cars if all goes well and the rest of us are going to ask our relatives too sixth one of the band members told a teacher they knew from school whos thinking about coming and walking out too and seventh one of the band members wrote a little something that the lead singer will read before they walk off stage and it would be great if anyone with editing experience could help to make it clearer or provide advice on what to add they tried to keep it short i will make a post about their writeup in the near future heres how we hope it happens the band will play the opening song which officially starts service and usually lets people know its starting many make their way from the foyer during the intro song and after someone gives the welcomeprayer after the opening song the lead singer will then give the speech before the band walks off stage and i will walk out with them from the pews along with relativesfriends one relative said she might bring some people she knows too which could make more of a statement to the church to see adults leaving too one of the relatives will also record the whole thing in case any parents dont react well to it and i will update after it happens if anyone has any further advice it would be appreciated and ill bring it to the band most of the band outside of two seniors arent old enough to vote this year but this is a chance to stand up for whats right against something that is adamantly infusing itself into christianity christian nationalism and making christianity lose all of its respect in our opinion we dont expect change to happen in the church as a result of our walkout but its a small thing we can do to say we did our part when faced with it ourselves another commenter put it best when she asked if wed be able to live with ourselves if we did nothing and the answer has been no for us so far i also wanna add something i forgot to clarify in my first post emma didnt say what she did out of the blue she had been vocal about the pastor talking politics for some time according to the band and ive seen much of it too however a lot of people sent dms disagreeing with the bands decision so before i get into it i wanna give specifics of what the pastor has done the pastor mentioned trump from the pulpit numerous times including the aftermath of the 2020 election to voice discontent over the results he has also celebrated roe v wades overturning from the pulpit pride month during june and even compared trumps legal trial to how jesus was persecuted leading up to his crucifixion things that have no place being vented about from the pulpit and this has happened over the course of a few years i received a few dms in the aftermath of my first post and some were encouraging while others not so much a few people who said they were christians said that emma was wrong to use the microphone to hijack the service with her words because she shouldve talked to the pastor first while calling her actions immature however when i showed the band the advice from my posts i also told them about the dms and they said that emma spoke to a leader about the pastors political sermons in the past but nothing came from it as he continued to speak politics from the pulpit frequently some people also said that our walkout wasnt godly because we like emma would be hijacking the service for a publicity stunt when church was supposed to be about god some people called us immature among harsher things but we disagree for two reasons first who is supposed to call out the misuse of the pulpit if not people who attend the same church where its misused a few dms said to do nothing and pray for god to change the pastors heart but hes been doing this for years and second the bible gives guidance on how to call out improper behavior in the church in matthew 181517 dealing with sin in the church 15 if your brother or sister sins go and point out their fault just between the two of you if they listen to you you have won them over 16 but if they will not listen take one or two others along so that every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses 17 if they still refuse to listen tell it to the church and if they refuse to listen even to the church treat them as you would a pagan or a tax collector emma has already talked to a leader oneonone and the band has voiced displeasure about emmas ban to the youth pastor only for him to disagree and say that emma was out of line regarding the part about tell it to the church i suppose the how might be up to interpretation maybe telling the church means telling a church leader instead of the congregation on stage but emma and the band have talked to various leaders including an elder too aside of our youth leader only for years of political rants from the pulpit to continue when jesus flipped tables in matthew 2112 we believe he did it because people were using the temple to sell things that had nothing to do with god and we believe that politics falls into the same boat someone commented a link in the comments of my first post that i never saw but i showed the band and we couldnt agree with it more pastor loran livingston talked about the role of politics in the church and how politics shouldnt be combined with christianity and ill leave the link here i still plan to speak with my parents ahead of 84 and ill share the writeup the band is working on really soon i really appreciate everyone who commented too lastly i wanna clarify that the walkout is the bands decision entirely i am not a member of the band i just do powerpoint lyrics during youth and im not even in the bands group chat with emma as some of the band members are contemplating punishments from parents two seniors who are concerned with their parents removing tuition help i will support whatever they decide while understanding that they have to take care of their future too as many commented if they decide to continue with the walkout i will support them and walk out from the pews but if they change their mind because repercussions are too great i will respect that and continue to support them second update august 17th 2024 i meant to get back to this sooner but some things happened on and after 84 since my previous post the band decided not go through with the walkout and emma was a big reason why the band told me that emma spoke to them a few days before 84 after she spoke to another bandmate who voiced concern the girl who spoke to emma was 15 and confided in her about physical abuse fears from her parents and emma spoke to the band on behalf of those fears emma also referenced some of the fears that the senior bandmates had about losing tuition support and told them that it wasnt worth risking their futures emma unlike the band had a fulltime job to support herself but some of the band was still tied to their parents for years she pretty much told them to go with their gut if they had fears about repercussions from their parents as the 15yearold girl had and the senior who feared losing tuition said that his parents threatened him with it in the past about something else which is why he thought of it i wasnt present when the band spoke to emma because im not a member of the band i only do powerpoint lyrics and they tell me what songs before youth group but they told me and the other powerpoint girl afterward so instead of playing on 84 the band collectively and privately resigned to the youth pastor at youth group the friday before 84 and none of them played on 84 they also told their parents that they would before doing so and a few of the bandmates said they were never forced to join the youth band by their parents they simply volunteered but that didnt mean they werent gonna say anything about emmas treatment they just wanted to in a safer environment that wouldnt risk embarrassing their parents in front of the congregation which could cost them privileges instead they decided to share their writeup with emma who was planning on posting her own explanation of her ban from the church emma posted her explanation along with the bands writeup to her socials on 84 regarding why the band collectively resigned and a few bandmates decided to repost it on their socials emma also tagged the churchs social in her post and believed that the walkout would do more harm to the band than good so the social media route was a slightly better alternative not as many people will see it but we believe potential rumors and gossip might do their thing a few of the bandmates also told their parents that they would no longer attend that specific church and while a few of them argued with their parents perhaps it was less than the wouldvebeen backlash of embarrassing them with a church walkout the 15yearold girl ended up attending church on 84 but the seniors didnt although they ended up returning the following sunday none of them including myself have attended youth group since the friday right before 84 and i didnt attend on 84 either two unexpected things also happened i received a dm from someone who said that they were from a christian news outlet and while i never heard of their outlet before they asked permission to share the bands story in one of their newsletters anonymously not including the bands names or the churchs and the band said theyll pray on it and weigh the decision additionally a pastor reached out in dms and said that he was encouraged by their story he also said that pastors were supposed to hold each other accountable and asked for the name of the church so that he could reach out pastortopastor to talk but emma and the band are undecided on this at the moment they said theyre going to pray on it along with how its important to make sure its a real pastor and that no harm will come to the church and i told the pastor that ill get back to him emma also told the band that her parents havent talked to her much since her church statements and thats because of arguments that they had some people thought that emmas parents left the church in support of their daughter getting banned but that wasnt the case her parents were banned too and emma said they didnt appreciate being blindsided by emmas statement and received some backlash for them emma still stands by everything she said but they arent talking at the moment the last thing ill say is about me and how i feel about everything and ill leave the bands statement from emmas post afterward this was the last straw in a long line of stuff for me from this particular church but it goes further than that i struggle to understand how parents can care more about church appearances more than the needs and desires of their kids and im not talking about bad things im talking about normal things and emmas statement said it better than i could emma said that god gave everyone free will but the 15yearold girl vented about physical abuse in regards to not wanting to go to church in the past and that is the opposite of what god taught god didnt force people to believe in him but some parents take away privileges if they refuse to fall in line with god and their church i barely even have any friends myself and im not even in the band group chat the band told me everything secondhand and none of them are my friends they hang out together outside of church but i only have one other friend from church because ive been homeschooled for all of my life because my parents think public school is too secular i cant even do official sports aside from sports played in the church field that our homeschool group uses so i cant do leagues or be on any teams like high school i just wish my parents wouldve let me go to school but apparently they dont think their religion is strong enough for me to go to school and supposedly not lose my faith kinda like theyve been keeping me on training wheels for 17 years personally i need a break from church i know not all churches are bad because the one i happened to grow up in is questionable but ive decided im not a christian because i said the salvation prayer when i was like 7 or 8 and i dont think that counts you dont know what you believe at that age because all you have is heavy bias from your parents and i need a break to be unbiased in the future after my pastor has made some questionable decisions in recent years venting politics in the church like the people who sold things that werent of god before jesus flipped tables im going to try and learn about other religions because christianity is all i ever knew so ive stopped considering myself a christian internally of late doesnt mean ill never return but i need a long break from christianity because just thinking of modern christians makes me sick too much hate disguised as christianity and political overlap i know theres good ones but i have to broaden my perspective and without a long break i wont be able to be nonbias in my search ive also argued with my parents about how ill no longer attend church but this is getting too long some of the band has faced punishments for not going and that is the epitome of whats wrong with their twisted version of christianity so i hope a break will help me reset in some ways the bands statement talked about how they would no longer attend the church but im not sure if their parents were the reason they returned on sunday morning after 84 regardless here is the writeup that they shared with emma and its longer than what they likely wouldve been allowed to say before the walkout if someone cut their microphone which is an advantage of social media in this case this is the band writeup that emma posted alongside her explanation of how she was banned as christians we are called to worship jesus christ but how does one become a christian by making a choice no one else can make for us but the last part is something too many christians forget jesus never forced anyone to follow him joshua 2415 tells us to choose whom we will serve but many have forgotten the part about free will and believe that fusing religion with conservatism is the way the sole purpose of christianity is a personal relationship with god it has nothing to do with christian nationalism and those who try to use our faith as an excuse to control others are false prophets as christians we shouldnt judge others because we are not god but since our church has banned emma and lied to the youth about how she chose to leave we can no longer play or remain in a church where the pastor uses the pulpit to preach other than the gospel and we pray that the true spirit of god returns someday third update september 7th 2024 something has been bugging me recently that i need to get off my chest and i will at the end i have not attended church in a few weeks and i hope i never do again my parents arent thrilled and weve talked about it they havent forced me to come but this situation was the last straw for me since my previous update one of the senior bandmates called to see how i was and he gave an update on whats been happening since emmas post that featured their statement the senior who called me john well say has started community college the other senior whos parents threatened to withdraw tuition has not that senior was punished for quitting the band the senior who called me was not the 15yearold girl who replaced emma as the lead singer was forced to return to church by her parents along with another boy who was in the band too emma remained in contact with the band after the post and he briefed me on whats been happening with her emma encouraged the two seniors to find a new church the senior who was punished said he wasnt interested and only attended church because his parents forced him for much of his life he also said he wouldnt attend church in the future because he wasnt ever really religious to begin with the senior who called me and wrote most of the statement said he was tired of church hypocrisy and that the situation made him never want to attend church again instead opting to practice privately on his own emma was sad that the situation soured their opinion of church but she was also not looking for a new church to take time to find herself when john asked if i would look for a new church i told him no but wasnt too specific other than saying i was tired im going be more more specific here because some things have really been bothering me a lot of comments said that we gave them hope for future generations of christianity but just reading that pissed me off personally and im gonna be more blunt than my previous posts personally i hate modern christianity in this country i know its not gods fault that many christians are so hateful these days but my distaste goes years before this incident because i feel like i never had a childhood im fucking homeschooled for all my life because my parents think public school is too secular dont have many friends besides one and my social skills suck because my only exposure is sunday service and youth group twice a week they police what i wear because of purity and they didnt even let me do sports or anything fun that kids do growing up but more than that im scared with no one to talk to my parents based my entire life on a religious that has no proof if its existence whatsoever and when i tried to voice my fears in the past they say i should know better which is not substantial evidence whats gonna happen when my time on earth ends if theres no god or judgment day all of my life wouldve been wasted on invisible beliefs never truly living to please something that doesnt exist im honestly terrified of that who am i to blame one day if they were wrong i wont be able to blame anyone because itll be too late that doesnt seem like a way to live life its already too late for me to have a childhood i just hope someone can ease my fears until i can afford to talk to a professional so ill keep my dms open for any advice despite seeing a few comments calling me and the band cowards for not doing the walkout it hurts to see comments saying that we gave hope for future generations of christianity because christianity is my parents reason for never giving me a childhood im done with christianity because of that fear i dont have enough substantial evidence to base my life on a whatif invisible god and im already 17 having barely lived at all i wanna go to college live a little sometimes drink and date someone not in church because its my last chance before 95 working for the rest of my life but i cant do that with constant guilt from purity and everything else extreme christians try to guilt you with many thought i was passionate about christianity from my last posts but to be honest ive hated christianity long before this mess as a result of my distaste for homeschooling it just felt good to be able to stick it to the church with the bands walkout idea and eventual post using their scriptures against them for a change but by no means am i passionate about christianity when so many people use it to control lives like mine through homeschooling and i hate that i know so much of the bible too and when you add how hateful and politically infused it has become in recent years i want nothing to do with it because i dont want to be associated with it fourth update february 16th 2025 this will probably be my last post after finding clarity on a lot of things recently last time i talked about my doubts regarding christianity including fear of the afterlife but worse than that i was blindly following christianity out of habit my parents took me to church ever since i was born however over the past few weeks i found my breaking point over something they told me for years that didnt hit me until recently my parents always said god comes first in their life after that their love for each other and me and my brother third i havent talked about my brother before because he was irrelevant to the church walkout and wasnt in youth group m11 and in the preteen program but hes relevant to this post my dad is a federal worker for the government and hes talked about the changes to the government at many dinners you can probably guess which way my parents voteone of the many things i dont understand about christians who support someone so unlike christ its hypocritical but thats getting off track my dad is a remote worker who doesnt live close to a federal building and hes been informed that hell have to report to a building once some details are worked out dad has begun looking for other jobs because we dont live in the same state as his work campus and he accepted the fork in the road resignation offer too dad said he thought remote workers would be exempt because he was remote working before covid but ill get to why im upset dad knew well before the election that the current president would likely make some changes to the government including the possibility of returning workers to office but he didnt care because they were the christian party despite being a federal worker himself before the election dad said that there were a lot of people who teleworked who were at home doing nothing and needed to be brought back but he didnt think it would include those who worked remotely before covid now he resigned and is looking for new work before the continued pay until september runs out but he doesnt seem to think its a big deal despite him being the only income in our family mom doesnt work and stays home some years back we had a family friend who lost their job and we gave money to help their family during that time being laid off is devastating but dad doesnt see it like that he still supports the administration and said its a part of gods plan despite uprooting our family and floated the idea of moving toosomething that would cause my brother to switch schools dont ask me why he was allowed to attend public school and not me and have to find new friends i have sympathy for those who live far from a campus like my dad who didnt vote for this but for people like my dad who voted for someone simply because he belongs to a christian party despite his sins and crimes i dont get it he supports our pastor when he talks positively about the president in church but if the pastor supported the 46th president from the pulpit i guarantee he wouldve had an issue with it jesus warned about false prophets but i digress if dad still support how the current administration is treating federal workers while being one himself i dont think ill ever get through to him so i wont waste my breath trying he chose his invisible noproofofexistence jesus candidate over our family even at the expense of uprooting it completely so while what im about to say could change in the future with time i am no longer a christian right now because i refuse to put an invisible noproofofexistance diety ahead of the people in my life who matter and people means new people ill hopefully meet after graduating dad has permanently lost my respect for uprooting our family and still supporting a man who acts nothing like what a christian should support its almost as if claiming to be a christian is a license to hate whoever you want and support wrongdoers so long as theyre on your side and its never been clearer to me im thankful for the 45th and 47th president for making it so easy to see who the real and fake christians arethe ones who use christianity as an excuse to hate in the name of jesus and the ones who walked away from the churches who replaced christ with another golden calf new update october 27th 2025 i was on the fence about making another update in hindsight i wrote too much already in my previous posts and my last post veered so far from the original topic but someone irl told me not to blame myself for the tailspin my family experienced this year because this year has been anything but normal in many ways i felt like i was going crazy due to my familys lack of logic since my last update my dad held a family meeting to inform us that things would be changing the buyout packagebiweekly payments he received from leaving the federal workforce ended in september and hes still yet to find a job as a result well have to cut back on eating out and some regular purchases but he also said that christmas will be smaller this year and mom doesnt work additionally my younger brother will not be enrolled in club sports after his current semester ends not school sports but the sports he does with friends at local clubs outside of the school along with other costcutting efforts however my issue with him dates back before the meeting took place to this day dad says he only applied for two jobs because firstly he said hed be picky and secondly because he used his time to get more involved in the churchfind himself with god he had roughly six months of biweekly paychecks from elons package to apply for many jobs but he only applied for two despite how he already tapped into his savings according to him and had no urgency because he saw it as a sixmonth vacation he says he regrets taking the offer because those on the team he left are still employed but he says its part of gods plan still supports the administration and says cutting back will teach our family to be grateful his lack of logic and priorities is infuriating getting away from that and back to the point of my original post im no longer a christian and im now 18 im living at home while attending community college and the two seniors who were in the band said they had no interest in attending church anymore and are now in college the 15yearold girl who replaced emma in the band is still the lead singer with new bandmates who replaced the seniors and emmas the only one whos still a practicing christian and is still taking a break from attending church in this political climate her instagram has become a place where shes continued to share her opinion on christianity and shes since made a followup video detailing specifics on how she was banned in more detail than the post she made with the bands statement in august of 2024 but the other thing that made me wanna update was a recent video that emma posted emma revisted how she was banned in relation to the recent passing of charlie kirk in her video she said too many christians had fallen in love with worshipping celebrities who claim to be christians but dont display christian fruit in relation to matthew 71620 she referenced hateful rhetoric spewed by kirk that didnt align with anything jesus would say in her opinion hateful rhetoric spewed towards people jesus said we should love regarding how she was banned from church she said it was similar to those who were firedsuspended from their jobs for speaking ill of kirk after his passing the only difference is that it happened to her in the summer of 2024 for denouncing christian nationalism a year before he passed which embodied the same hateful rhetoric she said that christianity had been hijacked by christian nationalism because too many christians blindly follow anyone who claims to be one and she said things wont change until that does i hope my dad finds work for the sake of my younger brother and i hope she and the rest of the exband were able to move on",

    "scotian shelf historical undersea landslides and tsunamis i live right on the shore the idea of a tsunami has always been a frightening one i was reading about the tsunami that effected newfoundland back in the late 1920s killing a number of people and leaving a thousand homeless along the burin peninsula it was caused by an undersea earthquake magnitude 72 43 foot high uprise in waves at some points coming ashore must gave been terrifying it got me thinking about the scotian slope and the evidence of several undersea landslides in the past some the size of pei apparently and the tsunamis that would have come along with them then i remembered reading that subsurface ocean temperatures here are rising at double the rate or more of surface temperatures living right on the shore i was wondering what the impact would be of those rising temperatures on the geologic stability of the scotian slope its sediments and the like pockets of methane reaching a gassingoff temperature causing instability for example if thats even a thing here the information below was from a simple google search it seems to say that in areas where this is being studied it does indeed precondition the sea floor for landslidesbut its not being specifically considered here so we dont really know any geologists or climate science folks know if this is being looked at im genuinely curious i know this kind of thing is tough to predict but its the kind of thing i think about in a dreadfilled mindset my simple google search of the subject while research confirms that deep water on the scotian shelf is warming significantly there is currently no specific public information or consensus in scientific literature directly linking this temperature rise to an increased risk of submarine landslides on the scotian shelf itself however broader studies from other regions notably antarctica suggest that climate change can act as a preconditioning factor for slope instability through complex geological processes key points deepwater warming the ocean floor off nova scotia is warming at about twice the rate of surface waters with bottom temperatures increasing by about three degrees over the last three decades in some areas this is an established trend caused by climate change lack of direct study for scotian shelf the search results did not contain any specific assessment or study that models or confirms an increased submarine landslide risk on the scotian shelf as a direct result of this deep sea temperature change research on the scotian shelf focuses more on coastal erosion due to sealevel rise and storm surges relevant mechanisms from antarctic research sediment weakening studies in the antarctic have found that climatecontrolled variations in sediment deposition eg the creation of weak waterrich diatom layers bounded by lowerpermeability layers during warm periods can precondition slopes to fail pore pressure the combination of weak layers and overlying denser sediments can increase pore pressure within the seafloor making it more susceptible to failure when a trigger occurs seismicity in the case of antarctica the trigger for landslides is often linked to seismicity from glacial loading or unloading which is also influenced by climate change potential future research need the antarctic studies highlight the importance of understanding the influence of global climate changes on factors influencing slope failure and emphasize the need for similar studies in other potentially vulnerable areas in summary while the mechanism for temperaturerelated slope instability exists and the scotian shelf deep waters are warming current public research has not explicitly considered or established a direct link to an increased landslide risk for the scotian shelf itself",

thick with the sweet smell of possibility cheap pizza and ck one tonights venue was the spacious vaguely beige rec room of kevin millers house in the san fernando valley a space hallowed by countless weekends of teenage inertia outside sprinklers hissed but inside the sound system throbbed with the familiar grinding chords of smashing pumpkins 1979 the bass vibrating through the worn carpet kevin all gangly limbs and an oversized hurley tshirt was currently engaged in the delicate operation of fastforwarding a rented vhs copy of twister to the tornado scene dude blockbuster was out of trainspotting again he griped adjusting the tracking with a satisfying whirrrr of the vcr some senior had the last copy maya was draped across the beanbag chair a phone cord wrapped around her finger as she semilistened to her moms strict nine pm curfew reminder while flipping through the new issue of sassy magazine yeah love you too mom bye she hung up a practiced teenage sigh escaping her lips curfew she announced to the room as if it were a new terrible law shed just discovered slumped on the cracked leather sofa brian was trying and failing to beat the final level of super mario 64 on kevins n64 a gift hed received that very morning peachs castle is stupid he muttered thumb a blur on the gray threepronged controller he was wearing a fresh pair of jncos their enormous cuffs already fraying from dragging on the ground the fourth member of their quartet chloe sat crosslegged on the floor meticulously painting her toenails a shade of frosted pale blue called ice queen a halfempty can of tab rested precariously near her knee its cool we can just watch clueless again she suggested not looking up i can practically recite it no clueless brian groaned finally throwing the controller down in defeat i can only handle so much as if in one night a sudden sharp dingdong from the front door sent a wave of mild panic through them kevins parents were out at a neighbors tupperware party meaning unexpected visitors were a wild card did anyone invite anyone kevin whispered hitting the mute button on the tv remote the room suddenly felt very quiet save for the hum of the refrigerator down the hall no maya whispered back sitting up straight maybe its the pizza guy we only ordered twenty minutes ago pizza delivery guys dont dingdong they knock chloe pointed out logically kevin crept out of the rec room and peeked around the corner of the entryway he let out an audible sigh of relief and flung the door open it was just leo a guy from their geometry class holding a worn cassette tape and looking slightly nervous hey sorry the front door was unlocked leo said stepping inside his tshirt was an authentic faded beastie boys licensed to ill concert tee that everyone coveted my car stereo ate my tape on the way over brian you still have that extra car adapter for my walkman chapter 2 waking up the smell of stale pizza and artificial grape soda was the first thing that greeted kevins senses the next morning sunlight sharp and unforgiving cut through the gaps in the blinds casting dusty stripes across the rec room floor brian was still asleep on the sofa mouth open a small puddle of drool on the leather cushion maya and chloe were curled up in the beanbags looking surprisingly comfortable kevin stretched his hurley shirt twisted around his torso his stomach growled a complaint and he sat up blinking the sleep from his eyes he glanced toward the television set intending to check the time on one of the cable news channels before his parents woke up he stopped midstretch where the bulky beige vcr and the squat gray rca television had been was now something entirely different it was a screen massive and floating above a sleek nearly invisible base on the entertainment center the strangest part he could see the wall and a framed picture of his family through the screen it was perfectly transparent until he saw tiny barelythere icons flicker to life at the bottom edge he rubbed his eyes hard the screen remained a sheet of glass that seemed to hum with an almost imperceptible energy uh guys he whispered his voice dry maya stirred pushed herself into a sitting position and followed his gaze whoa did your dad buy a new tv last night while we were asleep she mumbled voice thick with sleep that is weirdly flat brian snorted awake whadid we get the future or something he stumbled over to the set reaching out a tentative hand the surface was cool and smooth kevin try turning it on chloe suggested eyes wide now kevin fumbled for the remote on the coffee table but the remote was a small smooth oval object with only a few buttons nothing like the bulky thirtybutton controller from yesterday he picked it up a faint light glowed when he touched it power he said out loud uncertainly holding the remote towards the screen instantly the transparent screen filled with light and color a sleek minimalist interface appeared accompanied by a soft pleasant chime a small box in the corner blinked voice command active good morning voice command brian echoed stepping back like on star trek play mtv news kevin blurted out a test the screen shimmered reorganizing the windows on the display and a news anchor appeared overlaying the view of the wall behind the tv it wasnt the usual staticfilled cable the picture was so crisp it looked like the anchor was standing in the room okay this is some nextlevel richkid stuff kev maya said getting up i swear to god i have no idea kevin said bewildered my parents went to a tupperware party not the electronics store he reached for the pocket of his shorts for his pager and wallet his pager was gone instead he pulled out a slim clear device that looked like a smooth shard of dark glass the edges glowed when he gripped it it was cold to the touch lighter than air it looked just like the futuristic handhelds they had only ever seen in the pages of scifi magazines chloe and maya pulled identical devices from their pockets and bags brian checked his jncos pocket and found one too is this a phone maya asked touching an icon that looked like a phone receiver a minimalist interface appeared on the glass showing a dial pad and a tiny date in the upper corner friday may 31 1996 its still 96 she announced a hint of relief in her voice the date hadnt changed the world hadnt skipped a few years its also a music player brian discovered swiping a finger across the clear screen his finger leaving a glowing temporary trail a playlist appeared full of bands he knew but the interface was spaceage the group gravitated towards the corner of the room where kevins bulky pc usually sat on a small desk the boxy monitor and the enormous tower were gone in their place was a sleek allinone unit with a floating transparent screen hovering over a thin keyboard base lets go online brian suggested the group felt an instinctual pull to the only place they might find answers the internet slow and dialing up as it usually was kevin sat down and instinctively knew how to wake the computer with a motion gesture the transparent monitor flared to life the boot sequence was silent and instantaneous no screeching modem sounds he opened netscape navigator which now had a different icon and instantly connected there was no dialup noise just silence he typed in a query that felt suddenly vital space race end date the search results popped up in a fraction of a second an overwhelming flood of information organized impeccably kevin clicked the top link they all leaned in over his shoulder reading the text on the floating screen the space race a decadeslong competition for supremacy in space exploration between the united states and the soviet union formally concluded in 1991 with the collapse of the ussr the us established the first permanent lunar base tranquility in 1973 followed by zvesda nasa conducts first human missions to mars in 1986 first mars base established 1989 a heavy silence descended on the rec room nineteen ninetyone brian whispered my history book said the space race tapered off in the seventies and a moon base in 73 maya added her eyes darting between the transparent handheld in her hand and the futuristic computer screen chloe looked at her reflection in the glossy transparent screen of her new handheld her iceblue nail polish looking suddenly out of place the cold war ended in 91 and we won i thought things were still kind of tense they looked at each other the bright synthesized future humming around them in the form of transparent screens and silent computers the world outside the window still looked like their 1996 los angeles suburb but everything they held everything they touched screamed that their reality had been fundamentally subtly upgraded overnight the year was 1996 according to their handhelds but it was a different 1996a future that had somehow arrived forty years too early while they were sleeping off pizza chapter 3 the future the teens still reeling from the instanton internet and transparent screens stumbled out of kevins rec room and into his sundrenched backyard brian was the first to reach the sliding glass door and peeked through the vertical blinds his voice a disbelieving gasp guys you have to see this they gathered behind him peering through the slats and a new wave of shock washed over them it wasnt the los angeles they knew the low rumbling hum of the freeway was gone replaced by a softer more constant whir what had been a ceruleanbrown smudge on the horizonthe everpresent smogchoked los angeles skylinewas now a crisp crystalline vista of impossible structures gleaming towers of glass and chrome pierced the perfectly clear blue sky connected by what looked like aerial walkways and platforms the citys sprawl was replaced by an almost organic vertical architecture then they noticed the traffic or rather the complete lack of it on the streets below the roads were virtually empty save for a few boxy selfdriving shuttles silently ferrying passengers along designated routes but above the streets in organized luminous lanes a stream of vehicles flowed through the air sleek podlike flying cars zipped along a silent ballet of personal transport larger more utilitarianlooking flying semis and buses presumably hauling goods and people across the vast revitalized metropolis moved with the steady grace of an ocean liner its like blade runner chloe breathed her voice a mix of awe and terror but clean mayas gaze was fixed on a flying semi that banked a turn with an effortless dip of its chassis how is there no smog did did they invent some kind of smog cleaner this cant be real brian muttered shaking his head and pinching his arm im still asleep this is some kind of collective dream were having but the feel of the sunlight on his skin was real the smell of freshly cut grass from kevins pristine lawn was real kevin stared at a futuristic flying bus painted with the citys emblem as it floated down the main street his mind still stuck in the rhythms of 1996 struggled to process the seismic shift the sound of a leaf blower a noise he was accustomed to would have felt more natural what do we do maya asked pulling her arms around herself the world outside looked magnificent and terrifying an alien landscape painted over the familiar canvas of their suburban life we have to see if anyone else noticed kevin said his voice firming with a new strange resolve we have to find out what happened they ran back inside past the silent futuretech tv and computer their own transparent handhelds clutched tight in their hands they burst out the front door onto the stillfamiliar concrete of kevins driveway where their bikes were still propped against the garage but the garage itself a place of suburban normalcy now looked like the entrance to a time machine chapter 4 fusion the street outside was quiet the only sound the highfrequency hum of a personal aerial vehicle zipping two hundred feet overhead their bikes were still propped against the garage door the rubber on their tires smelling faintly of the same old air a small comfort in a world gone mad but the sight of a flying garbage truck floating silently down the street was enough to send them scurrying back indoors the front door slamming shut behind them they gathered around the transparent computer screen again a newfound purpose in their movements they needed answers and their new hyperspeed internet seemed eager to provide them okay kevin said grabbing the floating mousea small smooth orband moving it over the screen we know the space race went longer we know the ussr fell in 91 we have antigravity cars and clear skies there has to be a reason for the tech jump he began typing the silent keyboard responding instantly to his touch technological accelerator event the search results populated instantly the top result was a historical timeline from the global consensus archive 1980 project ares initiated us and ussr collaborate on joint human mission to mars spurred by the 1979 energy crisis 1985 ares i lands on mars first human steps on mars establishment of the olympus base begins 1988 fusion breakthrough dr aris thorne patents the confinement ring fusion reactor design at the olympus mars base enabled by unique atmospheric conditions and collaborative effort 1991 end of cold war global energy treaty signed fusion power plants begin construction worldwide 1994 first antigravity propulsion test leveraging ultrahighdensity power generation from fusion scientists develop stable gravimetric plating they read the timeline in stunned silence mars base brian whispered eyes wide they had a human mission to mars in 1985 in brians 1996 the space shuttle program was the peak of achievement and mars was a dream for the next century thorne figured out fusion on mars maya asked tracing the dates with her finger on the screen in 88 thats eight years ago the maya from yesterday thought fusion was a theoretical pipe dream always forty years away thats why the skies are clean chloe realized pointing out the window toward the pristine blue sky if they have fusion power plants everywhere they dont need fossil fuels and antigravity kevin added scrolling down to the 1994 entry they have so much power that they can just cancel gravity thats why the cars fly thats why everything is so sleek he looked at the transparent computer screen in front of them then at his clear handheld device the technology wasnt just invented it was accelerated the need for a mars base created the breakthrough and that breakthrough changed everything else the group stared at the computer screen the sheer scale of the change settling over them it wasnt just their neighborhood that was different the entire trajectory of human history had shifted catalyzed by a collaborative push into space in a decade that in their minds was defined by big hair and the irancontra affair we fell asleep in one version of 1996 brian said a slow dawning realization crossing his face as he looked out the window at a flying school bus and woke up in a whole other one chapter 5 space a new kind of wonder different from the sleek cityscapes filled the transparent screen as kevin navigated to the news site detailing the interagency space development a video played showcasing a montage of humanitys offworld progress the spaceships were nothing like the clunky gray and utilitarian rockets of their past powered by the clean powerful glow of fusion engines they were massive elegant beasts of engineering many followed a spine design a long central truss connecting the main propulsion at the rear with the habitat and cargo sections forward the habitat sections themselves often featured rotating rings to provide artificial gravity the rings spinning slowly a mesmerizing waltz of engineering and physics some ships were massive multihulled cargo carriers their fusion exhaust plumes a constant barely visible shimmer these were the vessels that carried the immense loads for asteroid mining operations or supplied the domed cities on mars and the moon bases the most stunning visuals came from the deep space exploration vessels these ships were a blend of industrial might and graceful retrofuturistic style they had large dishlike radiators and powerful thrusters but their living quarters often featured large transparent viewing ports bringing a sense of majesty and openness to the cold vacuum of space the aesthetic seemed to be a mix of the optimistic future of 1980s scifi movies but with the clean elegant execution of a civilization that had mastered its technology the final video clip showed the nasa administrator margo madison standing in front of a sleek new prototype that dwarfed the other ships the vessel had an unusual ringlike structure at its front her announcement that nasa was working on an alcubierre drive a technology that would theoretically allow fasterthanlight travel by warping spacetime marked a bold new future the images of these ships cemented a single truth in the teens minds their world had advanced and humanitys reach was no longer limited to earth chapter 6 food the teens still glued to the transparent screen continued to follow the rabbit hole of their altered reality kevin now an expert at navigating the futuristic interface typed in a new query why is the food so different the thought had just occurred to them as their stomachs rumbled a stark reminder of the halfeaten pizza box from the night before the search results detailed how the intense demands of the martian bases and moon colonies for selfsufficient food production had revolutionized agriculture on earth the same technologies used to feed astronauts in sterile controlled environments were brought home they read about the rise of vertical farming a system of hydroponic towers and automated climatecontrolled greenhouses that had replaced most traditional farms this new method used a fraction of the water and land allowing for fresh produce to be grown yearround in cities themselves next they discovered labgrown meat the same biological science that engineered resilient crops for space missions had created an ethical resourceefficient way to produce all kinds of meat in vast sterile facilities this had completely ended the industrial livestock industry massively reducing methane emissions and land usage the biggest surprise came with the mention of rnamodified and gmo crops instead of a controversial topic the space race had fasttracked this technology to create crops that were more nutrientrich resilient to disease and could be grown with higher yields in any climate this agricultural boom had led to an unprecedented abundance and variety of food a news article from their current 1996 timeline scrolled across the screen a profile on the changes to public education thanks to the abundance of lowcost highquality ingredients from vertical farms and synthetic protein labs every public school and university cafeteria now offers a menu of diverse and nutritious meals the article stated it showed images of high school students eating authenticlooking stirfry and pad thai so no more mystery meat in the cafeteria chloe asked her mind trying to reconcile the image of a healthy diverse school lunch with the soggy tater tots and rectangular pizza she was used to and check this out maya said pointing to a highlighted sentence college students no longer rely on ramen for sustenance with many only eating it as a nostalgic treat brian looked at the screen and then out at the flying cars silently cruising through the air the realization hit them all at once even the most mundane everyday aspect of their liveswhat they atehad been completely transformed by the race to the stars chapter 7 space continued the computer screen became a window into a vast thriving solar system kevin clicked on the news portals dedicated sol section which opened a dynamic map of human presence beyond earth interactive links detailed the scope of humanitys expansion the moon was no longer a barren rock below the tranquility base they had read about earlier were sprawling images of fortified habitats and industrial complexes nestled within the walls of craters and lava tubes protected from radiation and micrometeorites the headlines spoke of extracting helium3 for the fusion reactors back on earth clicking on mars brought up breathtaking aerial views of the planet while the surface was still predominantly red desert massive crystalline domes shimmered in the sunlight covering entire cities that thrived within the atmosphere outside the domes was thin but slowly being terraformed maya pointed to a headline about the new alexandria a university city in the valles marineris the timeline jumped further out showcasing more ambitious projects the asteroid belt was a hive of activity the screen showed crosssection diagrams of hollowedout asteroids that had been transformed into selfcontained rotating cities their inner surfaces covered in green space and residences providing both living space and immediate access to raw materials for the mining operations happening all around them the most shocking images came from the outer solar system a video detailed the europa accord a joint us russian and eu project focused on jupiters icy moon they watched footage captured by robotic submersibles exploring a vast black ocean beneath miles of ice the video cut to an underwater city anchored to the seafloor illuminated by artificial light and the faint filtered light of jupiter above finally they saw footage of colossal rotating ring space stations not just small modules but genuine habitats floating in orbit serving as transfer points for the massive spaceships that traveled between planets they served as bustling space ports teeming with a new class of space farers who saw the solar system not just earth as home brian the n64 controller still in his hand sat back completely overwhelmed europa underwater cities on europa yesterday the deepest we went was the local pool the sheer scale of the vision on the screen was undeniable the generation of teenagers who only yesterday thought the future would look like the jetsons in 2060 were now living in a 1996 where humanity had already become a multiplanetary species chapter 8 mech ball the news articles and historical timelines continued to pile up on the transparent screen painting a more complete picture of the future the teenagers now thoroughly engrossed had completely forgotten the stale pizza and their oncenormal lives asteroid mining led to this brian murmured his attention captured by a different headline kevin clicked on the article and a video of a sleek armored bipedal machine appeared on the screen it was several stories high and moved with a grace that defied its size its legs articulating like a dancers the article explained that early asteroid mining requiring complex maneuvers and precise drilling in zerogravity spurred a joint project between lockheed martin and a japanese aerospace company shikishima industries their partnership created advanced hapticcontrolled machines for mining operations these mining mechs were designed for stability and dexterity in lowgravity and their robust construction was necessary for breaking apart large asteroids it wasnt long before the technology combined with the new fusion power sources found a use beyond space exploration an entrepreneur seeing the potential for a spectator sport had the radical idea to repurpose the mining technology for entertainment the next video clip showed a massive futuristic stadium filled with thousands of screaming fans on a field roughly the size of five traditional football fields two teams of towering armored mechs clashed they resembled muscular futuristic football players with shoulder pads and helmets the mechs slammed into each other with controlled force their pilots inside experiencing every impact and jolt through the haptic feedback system a direct descendant of the asteroid miners controls they play football with mechs chloe said dumbfounded thats thats a new level of extreme a commentators voice echoed from the speakers describing the action with a frantic excitement that sounded familiar but applied to something entirely alien the las vegas neon knights are driving hard downfield pilot viper tanaka showing incredible precision in the drivers seat hotshot pilots maya said eyes wide with the spectacle theyre the new sports superstars the article went on to explain the demise of the nfl as technology had evolved football had become safer more precise and frankly less exciting with the advent of fusion power and advanced haptic technology the world was ready for a new more visceral spectator sport mech football with its blend of strategy raw power and hightech piloting filled that void perfectly it was violent dramatic and a perfect showcase for the incredible technology born from the space race the teenagers yesterday obsessed with the upcoming football season now stared at a future where their favorite game had been replaced by a much larger more explosive one the quiet suburban streets of their 1996 looked further away than ever chapter 9 humanitarianism the paradigm shift continued as the teens explored how their new world addressed fundamental human challenges the breakthroughs that fed space colonies and revamped american school lunches had a profound global impact the search results detailed a transformative era for africa the continent once frequently plagued by famine and disease in their original timeline had become one of the fastestdeveloping regions on earth the reasons were a direct result of spacederived technologies vertical farming and droughtresistant crops the rnamodified and gmo crops designed to grow with minimal resources and high yields in space were rapidly deployed in african nations these resilient crops flourished even in droughtprone areas simultaneously largescale efficient vertical farms were established in and around rapidly growing urban centers ensuring consistent food supplies that were no longer dependent on volatile weather patterns or traditional farming constraints disease reduction and health tech the advanced medical monitoring imaging like mri and ct scanners and portable diagnostic equipment developed for astronaut health and remote space medicine were commercialized and distributed widely these technologies coupled with improved sanitation infrastructure made possible by efficient fusion power and advanced engineering led to massive reductions in common diseases and an increase in life expectancy across the continent infrastructure leapfrog africa with abundant access to clean affordable fusion energy skipped the fossil fuelheavy industrialization phase of other nations this allowed for the rapid development of advanced infrastructure communication networks leveraging the vast satellite constellations and modern cities built with a futuristic cleanslate approach avoiding the pollution problems that choked cities like their la in the original timeline articles highlighted bustling african capitals with sleek architecture and thriving tech industries fueled by a healthy wellnourished and rapidly growing population the narrative was one of empowerment and progress using the very technologies born from the global competition of the space race to address earths most pressing problems the image on the screen showed a bustling futuristic african city vibrant and full of life the sight was a powerful contrast to the images of poverty and struggle that had dominated the news in their previous 1996 the world they now inhabited wasnt just technologically advanced it was fundamentally more equitable and prosperous a startling hopeful realization that left the four teens in quiet awe chapter 10 family a noise from upstairs broke the trance a familiar cheerful voice called down the hallway kevin breakfast is ready dont let those friends of yours sleep all day the sound of his moms voice unchanged normal and warm brought a jolt of relief mixed with a strange anxiety they were still their families the people they knew and loved were here in this upgraded world we should probably go eat kevin suggested leading the way upstairs to a kitchen that was also subtly differentsleek induction surfaces and a holographic recipe projector his parents greeted his friends as they always did mayas handheld buzzed my mom just texted me she said looking at the transparent screen shes fine my sisters fine everything at home is normal after a quick breakfast of something that looked like a bagel but tasted remarkably better and was nutritionally complete they realized they had to get to school they gathered their things and headed outside the bright sun of this new clear la morning hitting their faces we can take my car chloe offered pressing a button on her transparent handheld the vehicle that rose from the garage was a stunning sight in their original 1996 it was a brandnew standard silver bmw convertible a point of pride for her parents now it was a sleeker almost seamless silver vehicle with subtle aerodynamic curves and no visible exhaust pipes it didnt roll out it lifted hovering a few inches off the ground on silent antigravity pads the roof retracted smoothly and silently revealing a pristine white interior hop in chloe said a nascent grin on her face this was pretty cool they piled in and chloe instinctively knew how to operate the simple interface on the dashboard a map projected onto the windshield showing their route with an estimated time of arrival of just four minutes the car silently accelerated rising ten feet into the air and merging seamlessly into the flow of aerial traffic brian in the back stared down at the streets below a mix of sheer terror and pure joy on his face their school northwood high was the next surprise the familiar lowslung beige campus was gone in its place stood a towering complex of glass and steel integrated with vertical gardens and solar panels it was enormous a genuine campus of learning that looked more like a modern university from their old timeline the sheer scale was breathtaking chloe landed the bmw convertible in a designated aerial parking spot on the third level of the parking structure they walked toward the entrance their eyes scanning the massive grounds they emerged onto a large green quad and there it was the sports field it was far more massive than any field they had ever seen its turf a perfect artificial green the goalposts were colossal intricate structures designed to accommodate much larger players on the far side of the field a row of idle mechs stood parked and waiting they were easily two stories high their metallic hulls gleaming in the sun a few students in hapticsuits milling around them the bell ranga soft pleasant chime rather than a piercing klaxon students walked past them casually scrolling through transparent handhelds heading towards a school where lunch was gourmet football was played by robots and the future was already here the four friends shared a look they had a lot of catching up to do but for the first time since they woke up they felt a real buzzing excitement for the day ahead chapter 12 lunch the school cafeteria was less a cafeteria and more a vibrant openair food court sunlight streamed in through massive windows illuminating a space filled with bustling students holographic menu projections and the quiet whir of automation the smell was incredible a medley of spices fresh vegetables and savory grilled meatsworlds away from the soggy french fries and rectangular pizza of their memory the four teens found an empty table their trays holding colorful artfully arranged meals that looked like they belonged in a fivestar restaurant not a high school they had chosen a variety of dishes kevin had a plate of sushi maya had what looked like authentic thai noodles chloe was eating a perfectly grilled burger on a sesame bun that was labgrown and brian was devouring a massive burrito they were still so engrossed in their new reality however that they barely touched the food at first look at this brian whispered passing his transparent handheld to kevin on the shimmering screen was a highresolution image of one of the mech football players theyd seen on the field its intricate mechanical design perfectly rendered this is a real robot football player our worlds biggest sports stars are robots chloe nodded scrolling through her own device looking at closeups of the cockpits and theyre piloted by teenagers basically can you imagine the reflexes youd need its all that haptic technology from the asteroid miners maya added her own handheld showing a video clip of a mech making a brutal but somehow graceful tackle its insane as they gawked at the images a small sleek robot on two bipedal legs glided silently past their table it carried a tray of drinks its movements fluid and precise a few seconds later it delivered a pair of smoothies to two students at a nearby table and glided away its movements so normal that no one else even glanced at it another larger robot approached the main food station its multiple arms deftly scooping food from large warming trays and placing them on trays for students who had just arrived it had a small digital face that displayed a friendly minimalist emoticon the students walked up their handhelds likely preordering their meals and the robot served them with perfect efficiency is that thing an ai kevin asked mesmerized as the robot navigated the crowd with practiced ease it just knows what everyone wants and its so fast chloe said looking at the long empty line that would have been a chaotic snaking queue in her old timeline no lines no human errors just robots and amazing food brian who hadnt been able to keep his eyes off the robot waiter finally took a bite of his burrito his eyes widened and the food is oh my god this tastes like an actual burrito not some frozen thing reheated under a heat lamp the lunch crowd was a blur of seamless technological convenience students laughed chatted and ate their gourmet meals completely oblivious to the fact that their daily lunchtime routine was powered by technologies born from a space race that had rewritten human history for the four of them however it was just another mindbending realitywarping moment in their new bizarrely advanced 1996 chapter 13 clueless the lunch period was winding down when maya nudged chloe and discreetly pointed towards the center of the cafeteria look she whispered its them sitting at a table near the main entrance was a group of girls they instantly recognized in their old timeline this clique was the untouchable elite cheerleaders with perfect hair superior sneers and an uncanny ability to make everyone else feel small the ringleader brittany was famous for her cutting remarks and an entourage that followed her every move in this 1996 they looked different their clothes were stylish and definitely girly but with a futuristic edge brittany wore a sleek iridescent pink top that seemed to shimmer with a faint internal light and a flowing asymmetrical skirt that defied conventional fabrics her friends wore similarly chic brightly colored outfits their accessories minimalist and technologically integrated their hair was styled but not the stiff aerosolsprayed do of the old timeline it looked effortlessly perfect and healthy as the four friends watched one of the girls laughed a genuine warm sound that felt foreign coming from her another one activated a small projector on their table showcasing a complex rotating diagram of a mech engine part which they all leaned in to examine it seemed they were discussing a project not gossiping they look the same but different chloe observed and are they seriously looking at engine specs watch this brian said a devilish idea forming he picked up a piece of cutlerya sleek metallic utensil that was impossibly lightand accidentally fumbled it sending it clattering to the polished floor sliding directly toward the popular girls table the noise cut through the low hum of the cafeteria brittany looked up from the projection on her table the four friends braced themselves for the usual eyeroll the superior smirk and the icy glare that would demand they pick it up while making them feel like garbage instead brittany offered a small polite smile she elegantly reached down picked up the utensil and stood up walking toward them excuse me she said her voice completely devoid of the usual snobbishness just a calm and friendly tone i believe this is yours she held it out to brian brian completely thrown off balance stuttered uh yeah thanks sorry no problem she said still smiling accidents happen she glanced at their food then back at them i hope you guys are enjoying the pad thai the protein synthesis on the labgrown chicken in that dish is particularly high quality today i recommend adding a dash of the spice oil for a better flavor profile with a polite nod she turned and walked back to her table seamlessly rejoining her friends and their technical discussion the four friends stared after her their meals forgotten she was nice maya said in complete shock she offered a genuine food recommendation she didnt call me a loser or ask if my mom knew i was wearing that outfit kevin looked at the spot where brittany had been standing maybe the space race fixed attitude problems too he mused with all this advanced tech and a better world maybe people just stopped being so petty or maybe chloe suggested a thoughtful look on her face as she looked at her hightech cutlery in a world where the future is this amazing theres no time to be a jerk about who sits where the dynamic of the school had shifted as much as the technology cliques seemed less rigid focused more on shared interests in science or engineering than on social hierarchy in this advanced 1996 the world was too big and the future too exciting for high school drama",
    "were all going to burn radical acceptance and revolutionary optimism i used to work as a wildland firefighter on a hotshot crew fighting wildfires and seeing them rip through the landscape made me understand the fullscale of the collapse that were facing in a visceral way and now today confronting our political crisis ontop of it all made me draw this following analogy mop up the most boring part about fighting wildfires is whats called mop up after firefighters contain the active growth of a wildfire we spend days on our hands and knees literally touching every inch of ground around the fires edge we use our hands to dig through the ash and find hotspots places where embers are still burning and hot to the touch then we use our tools to mix those hot embers around in the dirt until they no longer pose a risk of restarting the fire its incredibly dirty boring work the palisades fire which killed 12 in los angeles in january of 2025 started from a small brush fire that was left to smolder after it was declared contained firefighters mopping up a small brush fire that authorities say reignited as the palisades fire five days later were ordered to leave the original burn scene even though they complained the ground was still smoldering and rocks remained hot to the touch according to firefighter text messages reviewed by the times to the firefighters surprise their battalion chief ordered them to roll up their hoses and pull out of the area on jan 2 the day after the 8acre blaze was declared contained rather than stay and make sure there were no hidden embers that could spark a new fire the text messages said america didnt mopup after its genocide of the indigenous americans it didnt mopup after the civil war it imported burning nazi embers and scattered them throughout our government after ww2 we watched with dispassion as we burned latin america we numbed ourselves with fast food and sitcoms while we blew apart the middle east the voracious capitalist monster has run out of fuel abroad and now its coming to consume its host the only way any of us survives the only way future generations have hope is if we see the truth of the moment that were in and fight as one there is no going back to normal normal is fueling our comfort by burning marginalized groups normal is starving other nations so that we can gorge ourselves normal is turning a blind eye to evil it is imperative that each of us develop a radical mindset that we develop radical acceptance and revolutionary optimism there is a wildfire bearing down to destroy us to destroy our future what are you going to do lay down and die let it burn you up or are you going to fight the only effective way to fight is by letting go of your attachments to how you want things to be you cannot be effective if youre trying to cling to what little you have in this life your future is already gone this trajectory were on is completely unsustainable it doesnt matter if you stay quiet and play it safe there is no safety in a firestorm without urgent action to accelerate decarbonisation remove carbon from the atmosphere and repair nature the plausible worstcase hit to global economies would be 50 in the two decades before 2090 the ifoa report said at 3c or more of heating by 2050 there could be more than 4 billion deaths significant sociopolitical fragmentation worldwide failure of states with resulting rapid enduring and significant loss of capital and extinction events our way of life is over climate change guarantees that the inaction of our governments today is only going to accelerate and worsen the effects were past the tipping point we will burn and drown and starve and freeze and we will be murdered in camps and in wars by fascist governments as the ultrawealthy subvert governments in order to protect their illgotten wealth all of your nice comfortable fantasies of a nice retirement if you just work hard will not come to pass the billionaires know whats coming theyre building their doomsday bunkers in preparation for the coming catastrophes theyre ruthlessly extracting every last resource from you right now and burning every bit of goodwill theyve ever generated because they dont intend to share this planet with you governments are turning farright all across the globe because this is the end game we are barreling toward collapse and no one has a will to fight we are on a sinking ship and the rats are clawing each other to death to reach the highest safest point and no one is working to save the ship i agree this dark it is bleak it is not doomerism only after you accept reality can you be effective only after you let go of your attachments can you be effective you must embrace radical acceptance you must embrace revolutionary optimism the only way we get through this is if the working class bands together as one to fight for our interests the capitalist mindset of every man for themselves this mindset that if i just accumulate enough wealth then i can be protected from the wildfire thats coming and i can ignore everyone around me being burned to a crisp will not work even the billionaires in their bunkers are going to be taken out by their own private security when the collapse comes no one will be safe we must work together sacrifice for each other see reality for reality not flinch from the hard truth that many of us wont make it radical acceptance that i will not have the easy comfortable future that i want revolutionary optimism that even if my life doesnt get better that my efforts are still worthwhile and that common humanity is worth fighting for i firmly believe that this is the mindset we need to face our future and it incumbent upon each of us to put in the work to develop radical acceptance and revolutionary optimism",

    "how would you have reacted if they made an episode where they woke up in an alternate 90s that was far more futuristic fun idea it would probably have massively raised the episodes budget would the futuristic world be inspired more by star trek or babylon 5 chapter 1 the year was 1996 and the air in suburbia los angeles hung thick with the sweet smell of possibility cheap pizza and ck one tonights venue was the spacious vaguely beige rec room of kevin millers house in the san fernando valley a space hallowed by countless weekends of teenage inertia outside sprinklers hissed but inside the sound system throbbed with the familiar grinding chords of smashing pumpkins 1979 the bass vibrating through the worn carpet kevin all gangly limbs and an oversized hurley tshirt was currently engaged in the delicate operation of fastforwarding a rented vhs copy of twister to the tornado scene dude blockbuster was out of trainspotting again he griped adjusting the tracking with a satisfying whirrrr of the vcr some senior had the last copy maya was draped across the beanbag chair a phone cord wrapped around her finger as she semilistened to her moms strict nine pm curfew reminder while flipping through the new issue of sassy magazine yeah love you too mom bye she hung up a practiced teenage sigh escaping her lips curfew she announced to the room as if it were a new terrible law shed just discovered slumped on the cracked leather sofa brian was trying and failing to beat the final level of super mario 64 on kevins n64 a gift hed received that very morning peachs castle is stupid he muttered thumb a blur on the gray threepronged controller he was wearing a fresh pair of jncos their enormous cuffs already fraying from dragging on the ground the fourth member of their quartet chloe sat crosslegged on the floor meticulously painting her toenails a shade of frosted pale blue called ice queen a halfempty can of tab rested precariously near her knee its cool we can just watch clueless again she suggested not looking up i can practically recite it no clueless brian groaned finally throwing the controller down in defeat i can only handle so much as if in one night a sudden sharp dingdong from the front door sent a wave of mild panic through them kevins parents were out at a neighbors tupperware party meaning unexpected visitors were a wild card did anyone invite anyone kevin whispered hitting the mute button on the tv remote the room suddenly felt very quiet save for the hum of the refrigerator down the hall no maya whispered back sitting up straight maybe its the pizza guy we only ordered twenty minutes ago pizza delivery guys dont dingdong they knock chloe pointed out logically kevin crept out of the rec room and peeked around the corner of the entryway he let out an audible sigh of relief and flung the door open it was just leo a guy from their geometry class holding a worn cassette tape and looking slightly nervous hey sorry the front door was unlocked leo said stepping inside his tshirt was an authentic faded beastie boys licensed to ill concert tee that everyone coveted my car stereo ate my tape on the way over brian you still have that extra car adapter for my walkman chapter 2 waking up the smell of stale pizza and artificial grape soda was the first thing that greeted kevins senses the next morning sunlight sharp and unforgiving cut through the gaps in the blinds casting dusty stripes across the rec room floor brian was still asleep on the sofa mouth open a small puddle of drool on the leather cushion maya and chloe were curled up in the beanbags looking surprisingly comfortable kevin stretched his hurley shirt twisted around his torso his stomach growled a complaint and he sat up blinking the sleep from his eyes he glanced toward the television set intending to check the time on one of the cable news channels before his parents woke up he stopped midstretch where the bulky beige vcr and the squat gray rca television had been was now something entirely different it was a screen massive and floating above a sleek nearly invisible base on the entertainment center the strangest part he could see the wall and a framed picture of his family through the screen it was perfectly transparent until he saw tiny barelythere icons flicker to life at the bottom edge he rubbed his eyes hard the screen remained a sheet of glass that seemed to hum with an almost imperceptible energy uh guys he whispered his voice dry maya stirred pushed herself into a sitting position and followed his gaze whoa did your dad buy a new tv last night while we were asleep she mumbled voice thick with sleep that is weirdly flat brian snorted awake whadid we get the future or something he stumbled over to the set reaching out a tentative hand the surface was cool and smooth kevin try turning it on chloe suggested eyes wide now kevin fumbled for the remote on the coffee table but the remote was a small smooth oval object with only a few buttons nothing like the bulky thirtybutton controller from yesterday he picked it up a faint light glowed when he touched it power he said out loud uncertainly holding the remote towards the screen instantly the transparent screen filled with light and color a sleek minimalist interface appeared accompanied by a soft pleasant chime a small box in the corner blinked voice command active good morning voice command brian echoed stepping back like on star trek play mtv news kevin blurted out a test the screen shimmered reorganizing the windows on the display and a news anchor appeared overlaying the view of the wall behind the tv it wasnt the usual staticfilled cable the picture was so crisp it looked like the anchor was standing in the room okay this is some nextlevel richkid stuff kev maya said getting up i swear to god i have no idea kevin said bewildered my parents went to a tupperware party not the electronics store he reached for the pocket of his shorts for his pager and wallet his pager was gone instead he pulled out a slim clear device that looked like a smooth shard of dark glass the edges glowed when he gripped it it was cold to the touch lighter than air it looked just like the futuristic handhelds they had only ever seen in the pages of scifi magazines chloe and maya pulled identical devices from their pockets and bags brian checked his jncos pocket and found one too is this a phone maya asked touching an icon that looked like a phone receiver a minimalist interface appeared on the glass showing a dial pad and a tiny date in the upper corner friday may 31 1996 its still 96 she announced a hint of relief in her voice the date hadnt changed the world hadnt skipped a few years its also a music player brian discovered swiping a finger across the clear screen his finger leaving a glowing temporary trail a playlist appeared full of bands he knew but the interface was spaceage the group gravitated towards the corner of the room where kevins bulky pc usually sat on a small desk the boxy monitor and the enormous tower were gone in their place was a sleek allinone unit with a floating transparent screen hovering over a thin keyboard base lets go online brian suggested the group felt an instinctual pull to the only place they might find answers the internet slow and dialing up as it usually was kevin sat down and instinctively knew how to wake the computer with a motion gesture the transparent monitor flared to life the boot sequence was silent and instantaneous no screeching modem sounds he opened netscape navigator which now had a different icon and instantly connected there was no dialup noise just silence he typed in a query that felt suddenly vital space race end date the search results popped up in a fraction of a second an overwhelming flood of information organized impeccably kevin clicked the top link they all leaned in over his shoulder reading the text on the floating screen the space race a decadeslong competition for supremacy in space exploration between the united states and the soviet union formally concluded in 1991 with the collapse of the ussr the us established the first permanent lunar base tranquility in 1973 followed by zvesda nasa conducts first human missions to mars in 1986 first mars base established 1989 a heavy silence descended on the rec room nineteen ninetyone brian whispered my history book said the space race tapered off in the seventies and a moon base in 73 maya added her eyes darting between the transparent handheld in her hand and the futuristic computer screen chloe looked at her reflection in the glossy transparent screen of her new handheld her iceblue nail polish looking suddenly out of place the cold war ended in 91 and we won i thought things were still kind of tense they looked at each other the bright synthesized future humming around them in the form of transparent screens and silent computers the world outside the window still looked like their 1996 los angeles suburb but everything they held everything they touched screamed that their reality had been fundamentally subtly upgraded overnight the year was 1996 according to their handhelds but it was a different 1996a future that had somehow arrived forty years too early while they were sleeping off pizza chapter 3 the future the teens still reeling from the instanton internet and transparent screens stumbled out of kevins rec room and into his sundrenched backyard brian was the first to reach the sliding glass door and peeked through the vertical blinds his voice a disbelieving gasp guys you have to see this they gathered behind him peering through the slats and a new wave of shock washed over them it wasnt the los angeles they knew the low rumbling hum of the freeway was gone replaced by a softer more constant whir what had been a ceruleanbrown smudge on the horizonthe everpresent smogchoked los angeles skylinewas now a crisp crystalline vista of impossible structures gleaming towers of glass and chrome pierced the perfectly clear blue sky connected by what looked like aerial walkways and platforms the citys sprawl was replaced by an almost organic vertical architecture then they noticed the traffic or rather the complete lack of it on the streets below the roads were virtually empty save for a few boxy selfdriving shuttles silently ferrying passengers along designated routes but above the streets in organized luminous lanes a stream of vehicles flowed through the air sleek podlike flying cars zipped along a silent ballet of personal transport larger more utilitarianlooking flying semis and buses presumably hauling goods and people across the vast revitalized metropolis moved with the steady grace of an ocean liner its like blade runner chloe breathed her voice a mix of awe and terror but clean mayas gaze was fixed on a flying semi that banked a turn with an effortless dip of its chassis how is there no smog did did they invent some kind of smog cleaner this cant be real brian muttered shaking his head and pinching his arm im still asleep this is some kind of collective dream were having but the feel of the sunlight on his skin was real the smell of freshly cut grass from kevins pristine lawn was real kevin stared at a futuristic flying bus painted with the citys emblem as it floated down the main street his mind still stuck in the rhythms of 1996 struggled to process the seismic shift the sound of a leaf blower a noise he was accustomed to would have felt more natural what do we do maya asked pulling her arms around herself the world outside looked magnificent and terrifying an alien landscape painted over the familiar canvas of their suburban life we have to see if anyone else noticed kevin said his voice firming with a new strange resolve we have to find out what happened they ran back inside past the silent futuretech tv and computer their own transparent handhelds clutched tight in their hands they burst out the front door onto the stillfamiliar concrete of kevins driveway where their bikes were still propped against the garage but the garage itself a place of suburban normalcy now looked like the entrance to a time machine chapter 4 fusion the street outside was quiet the only sound the highfrequency hum of a personal aerial vehicle zipping two hundred feet overhead their bikes were still propped against the garage door the rubber on their tires smelling faintly of the same old air a small comfort in a world gone mad but the sight of a flying garbage truck floating silently down the street was enough to send them scurrying back indoors the front door slamming shut behind them they gathered around the transparent computer screen again a newfound purpose in their movements they needed answers and their new hyperspeed internet seemed eager to provide them okay kevin said grabbing the floating mousea small smooth orband moving it over the screen we know the space race went longer we know the ussr fell in 91 we have antigravity cars and clear skies there has to be a reason for the tech jump he began typing the silent keyboard responding instantly to his touch technological accelerator event the search results populated instantly the top result was a historical timeline from the global consensus archive 1980 project ares initiated us and ussr collaborate on joint human mission to mars spurred by the 1979 energy crisis 1985 ares i lands on mars first human steps on mars establishment of the olympus base begins 1988 fusion breakthrough dr aris thorne patents the confinement ring fusion reactor design at the olympus mars base enabled by unique atmospheric conditions and collaborative effort 1991 end of cold war global energy treaty signed fusion power plants begin construction worldwide 1994 first antigravity propulsion test leveraging ultrahighdensity power generation from fusion scientists develop stable gravimetric plating they read the timeline in stunned silence mars base brian whispered eyes wide they had a human mission to mars in 1985 in brians 1996 the space shuttle program was the peak of achievement and mars was a dream for the next century thorne figured out fusion on mars maya asked tracing the dates with her finger on the screen in 88 thats eight years ago the maya from yesterday thought fusion was a theoretical pipe dream always forty years away thats why the skies are clean chloe realized pointing out the window toward the pristine blue sky if they have fusion power plants everywhere they dont need fossil fuels and antigravity kevin added scrolling down to the 1994 entry they have so much power that they can just cancel gravity thats why the cars fly thats why everything is so sleek he looked at the transparent computer screen in front of them then at his clear handheld device the technology wasnt just invented it was accelerated the need for a mars base created the breakthrough and that breakthrough changed everything else the group stared at the computer screen the sheer scale of the change settling over them it wasnt just their neighborhood that was different the entire trajectory of human history had shifted catalyzed by a collaborative push into space in a decade that in their minds was defined by big hair and the irancontra affair we fell asleep in one version of 1996 brian said a slow dawning realization crossing his face as he looked out the window at a flying school bus and woke up in a whole other one chapter 5 space a new kind of wonder different from the sleek cityscapes filled the transparent screen as kevin navigated to the news site detailing the interagency space development a video played showcasing a montage of humanitys offworld progress the spaceships were nothing like the clunky gray and utilitarian rockets of their past powered by the clean powerful glow of fusion engines they were massive elegant beasts of engineering many followed a spine design a long central truss connecting the main propulsion at the rear with the habitat and cargo sections forward the habitat sections themselves often featured rotating rings to provide artificial gravity the rings spinning slowly a mesmerizing waltz of engineering and physics some ships were massive multihulled cargo carriers their fusion exhaust plumes a constant barely visible shimmer these were the vessels that carried the immense loads for asteroid mining operations or supplied the domed cities on mars and the moon bases the most stunning visuals came from the deep space exploration vessels these ships were a blend of industrial might and graceful retrofuturistic style they had large dishlike radiators and powerful thrusters but their living quarters often featured large transparent viewing ports bringing a sense of majesty and openness to the cold vacuum of space the aesthetic seemed to be a mix of the optimistic future of 1980s scifi movies but with the clean elegant execution of a civilization that had mastered its technology the final video clip showed the nasa administrator margo madison standing in front of a sleek new prototype that dwarfed the other ships the vessel had an unusual ringlike structure at its front her announcement that nasa was working on an alcubierre drive a technology that would theoretically allow fasterthanlight travel by warping spacetime marked a bold new future the images of these ships cemented a single truth in the teens minds their world had advanced and humanitys reach was no longer limited to earth chapter 6 food the teens still glued to the transparent screen continued to follow the rabbit hole of their altered reality kevin now an expert at navigating the futuristic interface typed in a new query why is the food so different the thought had just occurred to them as their stomachs rumbled a stark reminder of the halfeaten pizza box from the night before the search results detailed how the intense demands of the martian bases and moon colonies for selfsufficient food production had revolutionized agriculture on earth the same technologies used to feed astronauts in sterile controlled environments were brought home they read about the rise of vertical farming a system of hydroponic towers and automated climatecontrolled greenhouses that had replaced most traditional farms this new method used a fraction of the water and land allowing for fresh produce to be grown yearround in cities themselves next they discovered labgrown meat the same biological science that engineered resilient crops for space missions had created an ethical resourceefficient way to produce all kinds of meat in vast sterile facilities this had completely ended the industrial livestock industry massively reducing methane emissions and land usage the biggest surprise came with the mention of rnamodified and gmo crops instead of a controversial topic the space race had fasttracked this technology to create crops that were more nutrientrich resilient to disease and could be grown with higher yields in any climate this agricultural boom had led to an unprecedented abundance and variety of food a news article from their current 1996 timeline scrolled across the screen a profile on the changes to public education thanks to the abundance of lowcost highquality ingredients from vertical farms and synthetic protein labs every public school and university cafeteria now offers a menu of diverse and nutritious meals the article stated it showed images of high school students eating authenticlooking stirfry and pad thai so no more mystery meat in the cafeteria chloe asked her mind trying to reconcile the image of a healthy diverse school lunch with the soggy tater tots and rectangular pizza she was used to and check this out maya said pointing to a highlighted sentence college students no longer rely on ramen for sustenance with many only eating it as a nostalgic treat brian looked at the screen and then out at the flying cars silently cruising through the air the realization hit them all at once even the most mundane everyday aspect of their liveswhat they atehad been completely transformed by the race to the stars chapter 7 space continued the computer screen became a window into a vast thriving solar system kevin clicked on the news portals dedicated sol section which opened a dynamic map of human presence beyond earth interactive links detailed the scope of humanitys expansion the moon was no longer a barren rock below the tranquility base they had read about earlier were sprawling images of fortified habitats and industrial complexes nestled within the walls of craters and lava tubes protected from radiation and micrometeorites the headlines spoke of extracting helium3 for the fusion reactors back on earth clicking on mars brought up breathtaking aerial views of the planet while the surface was still predominantly red desert massive crystalline domes shimmered in the sunlight covering entire cities that thrived within the atmosphere outside the domes was thin but slowly being terraformed maya pointed to a headline about the new alexandria a university city in the valles marineris the timeline jumped further out showcasing more ambitious projects the asteroid belt was a hive of activity the screen showed crosssection diagrams of hollowedout asteroids that had been transformed into selfcontained rotating cities their inner surfaces covered in green space and residences providing both living space and immediate access to raw materials for the mining operations happening all around them the most shocking images came from the outer solar system a video detailed the europa accord a joint us russian and eu project focused on jupiters icy moon they watched footage captured by robotic submersibles exploring a vast black ocean beneath miles of ice the video cut to an underwater city anchored to the seafloor illuminated by artificial light and the faint filtered light of jupiter above finally they saw footage of colossal rotating ring space stations not just small modules but genuine habitats floating in orbit serving as transfer points for the massive spaceships that traveled between planets they served as bustling space ports teeming with a new class of space farers who saw the solar system not just earth as home brian the n64 controller still in his hand sat back completely overwhelmed europa underwater cities on europa yesterday the deepest we went was the local pool the sheer scale of the vision on the screen was undeniable the generation of teenagers who only yesterday thought the future would look like the jetsons in 2060 were now living in a 1996 where humanity had already become a multiplanetary species chapter 8 mech ball the news articles and historical timelines continued to pile up on the transparent screen painting a more complete picture of the future the teenagers now thoroughly engrossed had completely forgotten the stale pizza and their oncenormal lives asteroid mining led to this brian murmured his attention captured by a different headline kevin clicked on the article and a video of a sleek armored bipedal machine appeared on the screen it was several stories high and moved with a grace that defied its size its legs articulating like a dancers the article explained that early asteroid mining requiring complex maneuvers and precise drilling in zerogravity spurred a joint project between lockheed martin and a japanese aerospace company shikishima industries their partnership created advanced hapticcontrolled machines for mining operations these mining mechs were designed for stability and dexterity in lowgravity and their robust construction was necessary for breaking apart large asteroids it wasnt long before the technology combined with the new fusion power sources found a use beyond space exploration an entrepreneur seeing the potential for a spectator sport had the radical idea to repurpose the mining technology for entertainment the next video clip showed a massive futuristic stadium filled with thousands of screaming fans on a field roughly the size of five traditional football fields two teams of towering armored mechs clashed they resembled muscular futuristic football players with shoulder pads and helmets the mechs slammed into each other with controlled force their pilots inside experiencing every impact and jolt through the haptic feedback system a direct descendant of the asteroid miners controls they play football with mechs chloe said dumbfounded thats thats a new level of extreme a commentators voice echoed from the speakers describing the action with a frantic excitement that sounded familiar but applied to something entirely alien the las vegas neon knights are driving hard downfield pilot viper tanaka showing incredible precision in the drivers seat hotshot pilots maya said eyes wide with the spectacle theyre the new sports superstars the article went on to explain the demise of the nfl as technology had evolved football had become safer more precise and frankly less exciting with the advent of fusion power and advanced haptic technology the world was ready for a new more visceral spectator sport mech football with its blend of strategy raw power and hightech piloting filled that void perfectly it was violent dramatic and a perfect showcase for the incredible technology born from the space race the teenagers yesterday obsessed with the upcoming football season now stared at a future where their favorite game had been replaced by a much larger more explosive one the quiet suburban streets of their 1996 looked further away than ever chapter 9 humanitarianism the paradigm shift continued as the teens explored how their new world addressed fundamental human challenges the breakthroughs that fed space colonies and revamped american school lunches had a profound global impact the search results detailed a transformative era for africa the continent once frequently plagued by famine and disease in their original timeline had become one of the fastestdeveloping regions on earth the reasons were a direct result of spacederived technologies vertical farming and droughtresistant crops the rnamodified and gmo crops designed to grow with minimal resources and high yields in space were rapidly deployed in african nations these resilient crops flourished even in droughtprone areas simultaneously largescale efficient vertical farms were established in and around rapidly growing urban centers ensuring consistent food supplies that were no longer dependent on volatile weather patterns or traditional farming constraints disease reduction and health tech the advanced medical monitoring imaging like mri and ct scanners and portable diagnostic equipment developed for astronaut health and remote space medicine were commercialized and distributed widely these technologies coupled with improved sanitation infrastructure made possible by efficient fusion power and advanced engineering led to massive reductions in common diseases and an increase in life expectancy across the continent infrastructure leapfrog africa with abundant access to clean affordable fusion energy skipped the fossil fuelheavy industrialization phase of other nations this allowed for the rapid development of advanced infrastructure communication networks leveraging the vast satellite constellations and modern cities built with a futuristic cleanslate approach avoiding the pollution problems that choked cities like their la in the original timeline articles highlighted bustling african capitals with sleek architecture and thriving tech industries fueled by a healthy wellnourished and rapidly growing population the narrative was one of empowerment and progress using the very technologies born from the global competition of the space race to address earths most pressing problems the image on the screen showed a bustling futuristic african city vibrant and full of life the sight was a powerful contrast to the images of poverty and struggle that had dominated the news in their previous 1996 the world they now inhabited wasnt just technologically advanced it was fundamentally more equitable and prosperous a startling hopeful realization that left the four teens in quiet awe chapter 10 family a noise from upstairs broke the trance a familiar cheerful voice called down the hallway kevin breakfast is ready dont let those friends of yours sleep all day the sound of his moms voice unchanged normal and warm brought a jolt of relief mixed with a strange anxiety they were still their families the people they knew and loved were here in this upgraded world we should probably go eat kevin suggested leading the way upstairs to a kitchen that was also subtly differentsleek induction surfaces and a holographic recipe projector his parents greeted his friends as they always did mayas handheld buzzed my mom just texted me she said looking at the transparent screen shes fine my sisters fine everything at home is normal after a quick breakfast of something that looked like a bagel but tasted remarkably better and was nutritionally complete they realized they had to get to school they gathered their things and headed outside the bright sun of this new clear la morning hitting their faces we can take my car chloe offered pressing a button on her transparent handheld the vehicle that rose from the garage was a stunning sight in their original 1996 it was a brandnew standard silver bmw convertible a point of pride for her parents now it was a sleeker almost seamless silver vehicle with subtle aerodynamic curves and no visible exhaust pipes it didnt roll out it lifted hovering a few inches off the ground on silent antigravity pads the roof retracted smoothly and silently revealing a pristine white interior hop in chloe said a nascent grin on her face this was pretty cool they piled in and chloe instinctively knew how to operate the simple interface on the dashboard a map projected onto the windshield showing their route with an estimated time of arrival of just four minutes the car silently accelerated rising ten feet into the air and merging seamlessly into the flow of aerial traffic brian in the back stared down at the streets below a mix of sheer terror and pure joy on his face their school northwood high was the next surprise the familiar lowslung beige campus was gone in its place stood a towering complex of glass and steel integrated with vertical gardens and solar panels it was enormous a genuine campus of learning that looked more like a modern university from their old timeline the sheer scale was breathtaking chloe landed the bmw convertible in a designated aerial parking spot on the third level of the parking structure they walked toward the entrance their eyes scanning the massive grounds they emerged onto a large green quad and there it was the sports field it was far more massive than any field they had ever seen its turf a perfect artificial green the goalposts were colossal intricate structures designed to accommodate much larger players on the far side of the field a row of idle mechs stood parked and waiting they were easily two stories high their metallic hulls gleaming in the sun a few students in hapticsuits milling around them the bell ranga soft pleasant chime rather than a piercing klaxon students walked past them casually scrolling through transparent handhelds heading towards a school where lunch was gourmet football was played by robots and the future was already here the four friends shared a look they had a lot of catching up to do but for the first time since they woke up they felt a real buzzing excitement for the day ahead chapter 12 lunch the school cafeteria was less a cafeteria and more a vibrant openair food court sunlight streamed in through massive windows illuminating a space filled with bustling students holographic menu projections and the quiet whir of automation the smell was incredible a medley of spices fresh vegetables and savory grilled meatsworlds away from the soggy french fries and rectangular pizza of their memory the four teens found an empty table their trays holding colorful artfully arranged meals that looked like they belonged in a fivestar restaurant not a high school they had chosen a variety of dishes kevin had a plate of sushi maya had what looked like authentic thai noodles chloe was eating a perfectly grilled burger on a sesame bun that was labgrown and brian was devouring a massive burrito they were still so engrossed in their new reality however that they barely touched the food at first look at this brian whispered passing his transparent handheld to kevin on the shimmering screen was a highresolution image of one of the mech football players theyd seen on the field its intricate mechanical design perfectly rendered this is a real robot football player our worlds biggest sports stars are robots chloe nodded scrolling through her own device looking at closeups of the cockpits and theyre piloted by teenagers basically can you imagine the reflexes youd need its all that haptic technology from the asteroid miners maya added her own handheld showing a video clip of a mech making a brutal but somehow graceful tackle its insane as they gawked at the images a small sleek robot on two bipedal legs glided silently past their table it carried a tray of drinks its movements fluid and precise a few seconds later it delivered a pair of smoothies to two students at a nearby table and glided away its movements so normal that no one else even glanced at it another larger robot approached the main food station its multiple arms deftly scooping food from large warming trays and placing them on trays for students who had just arrived it had a small digital face that displayed a friendly minimalist emoticon the students walked up their handhelds likely preordering their meals and the robot served them with perfect efficiency is that thing an ai kevin asked mesmerized as the robot navigated the crowd with practiced ease it just knows what everyone wants and its so fast chloe said looking at the long empty line that would have been a chaotic snaking queue in her old timeline no lines no human errors just robots and amazing food brian who hadnt been able to keep his eyes off the robot waiter finally took a bite of his burrito his eyes widened and the food is oh my god this tastes like an actual burrito not some frozen thing reheated under a heat lamp the lunch crowd was a blur of seamless technological convenience students laughed chatted and ate their gourmet meals completely oblivious to the fact that their daily lunchtime routine was powered by technologies born from a space race that had rewritten human history for the four of them however it was just another mindbending realitywarping moment in their new bizarrely advanced 1996 chapter 13 clueless the lunch period was winding down when maya nudged chloe and discreetly pointed towards the center of the cafeteria look she whispered its them sitting at a table near the main entrance was a group of girls they instantly recognized in their old timeline this clique was the untouchable elite cheerleaders with perfect hair superior sneers and an uncanny ability to make everyone else feel small the ringleader brittany was famous for her cutting remarks and an entourage that followed her every move in this 1996 they looked different their clothes were stylish and definitely girly but with a futuristic edge brittany wore a sleek iridescent pink top that seemed to shimmer with a faint internal light and a flowing asymmetrical skirt that defied conventional fabrics her friends wore similarly chic brightly colored outfits their accessories minimalist and technologically integrated their hair was styled but not the stiff aerosolsprayed do of the old timeline it looked effortlessly perfect and healthy as the four friends watched one of the girls laughed a genuine warm sound that felt foreign coming from her another one activated a small projector on their table showcasing a complex rotating diagram of a mech engine part which they all leaned in to examine it seemed they were discussing a project not gossiping they look the same but different chloe observed and are they seriously looking at engine specs watch this brian said a devilish idea forming he picked up a piece of cutlerya sleek metallic utensil that was impossibly lightand accidentally fumbled it sending it clattering to the polished floor sliding directly toward the popular girls table the noise cut through the low hum of the cafeteria brittany looked up from the projection on her table the four friends braced themselves for the usual eyeroll the superior smirk and the icy glare that would demand they pick it up while making them feel like garbage instead brittany offered a small polite smile she elegantly reached down picked up the utensil and stood up walking toward them excuse me she said her voice completely devoid of the usual snobbishness just a calm and friendly tone i believe this is yours she held it out to brian brian completely thrown off balance stuttered uh yeah thanks sorry no problem she said still smiling accidents happen she glanced at their food then back at them i hope you guys are enjoying the pad thai the protein synthesis on the labgrown chicken in that dish is particularly high quality today i recommend adding a dash of the spice oil for a better flavor profile with a polite nod she turned and walked back to her table seamlessly rejoining her friends and their technical discussion the four friends stared after her their meals forgotten she was nice maya said in complete shock she offered a genuine food recommendation she didnt call me a loser or ask if my mom knew i was wearing that outfit kevin looked at the spot where brittany had been standing maybe the space race fixed attitude problems too he mused with all this advanced tech and a better world maybe people just stopped being so petty or maybe chloe suggested a thoughtful look on her face as she looked at her hightech cutlery in a world where the future is this amazing theres no time to be a jerk about who sits where the dynamic of the school had shifted as much as the technology cliques seemed less rigid focused more on shared interests in science or engineering than on social hierarchy in this advanced 1996 the world was too big and the future too exciting for high school drama",

    "carney government looking into army of bureaucrats in new defence plan you cant make this up a one week crash course for bureaucrats and pretend theyre army now you know how the libs are trying to pretend to meet nato requirements more like theyre putting together an army of brownshirtsmasochists to go against cdns link at btm prime minister mark carneys government is quietly preparing a massive expansion of canadas military and its counting on federal and provincial bureaucrats to fill the ranks a new department of national defence dnd directive signed may 30 2025 by chief of the defence staff gen jennie carignan and deputy minister stefanie beck lays out a plan to recruit as many as 300000 canadians into a defence mobilization plan that includes thousands of public servants who would be given basic weapons and tactical training and sworn into the militarys supplementary reserve the move comes as canadas regular and reserve forces continue to face a recruitment crisis one so severe that auditor general karen hogan recently warned the military cannot meet its operational needs according to the directive bureaucrats who volunteer would receive a oneweek crash course in military basics firearms truck driving and drone operations the training would take place annually and participants would remain part of the supplementary reserve a littleknown wing of the forces composed mostly of retirees willing to return to duty in an emergency at present that reserve has only 4384 members under the new mobilization plan that number could swell to 300000 entry requirements would be loosened the directive explicitly says the standards would be less restrictive than those for the reserve force with relaxed age physical and fitness criteria the recruits would not be issued uniforms and their service time would not count toward government pensions however they would receive medical coverage during training the focus according to carignan and beck would be on basic skills shoot move and communicate drive a truck fly a drone the directive envisions a whole of society effort meaning this mobilization would extend beyond the department of national defence the privy council office working under carneys leadership would be tasked with leading what the directive calls a new approach to population engagement aimed at instilling a servant culture around sovereignty and public accountability in plain language the government wants every canadian not just soldiers to play a role in defending the country or serving it dnd spokeswoman andreanne poulin confirmed that participation would be voluntary for now saying only that planning has begun to explore how an expanded reserve force could contribute to greater national resilience critics may note that resilience has become a favourite word among ottawa bureaucrats for justifying sweeping governmentled initiatives in response to crises from pandemics to climate change to make this mobilization plan a reality a dnd tiger team began work june 4 at the departments carling campus in ottawa the team is tasked with studying legislative changes recruitment pathways and coordination across departments and provinces neither dnd nor the forces would say when the full plan might be ready or what emergency might trigger its implementation the same directive calls for a massive increase to the current reserve force from roughly 23500 to 100000 members a quadrupling of the existing structure how those new troops would be recruited or trained remains unclear the directive cites finland as a model the nordic nation requires all men aged 18 to 60 to serve in the military with women eligible to volunteer after service finns are placed in the reserves ready to be called up in wartime this year helsinki moved to raise the reserve age limit to 65 canadas proposal stops short of conscription but its nod to finlands system has raised eyebrows among some defence observers who say it could be a first step toward mandatory service if voluntary recruitment fails the document does not say what would trigger the mobilization plan but the rationale is clear growing global instability and fears of greatpower conflict in june briggen brendan cook of the royal canadian air force warned canada must rearm to prepare for a possible war with russia or china within the next five years earlier former chief of the defence staff gen wayne eyre stated bluntly that canada is already at war with both powers albeit in the cyber and information domains against that backdrop beck and carignan argue that canada must build greater resiliency and autonomy on security matters but for a country whose armed forces have struggled to meet even natos minimal requirements critics say the plan to enlist bureaucrats smacks of desperation the mobilization plan underscores a hard truth the canadian military is not ready for a major conflict years of underfunding poor recruitment and low morale have hollowed out the ranks the auditor generals report in october 2024 found that the forces still cannot attract or train enough personnel to fill key roles such as pilots and technicians now the carney government is looking inward to its own bureaucracy to bridge that gap whether public servants will trade their laptops for rifles remains to be seen but the idea that ottawa is preparing to mobilize hundreds of thousands of canadians suggests the government sees the world and canadas role in it changing fast and if history is any guide that kind of change rarely stops where it starts",

    "presentday climate change includes both global warmingthe ongoing increase in global average temperatureand its wider effects on earths climate system climate change in a broader sense also includes previous longterm changes to earths climate the current rise in global temperatures is driven by human activities especially fossil fuel coal oil and natural gas burning since the industrial revolution fossil fuel use deforestation and some agricultural and industrial practices release greenhouse gases these gases absorb some of the heat that the earth radiates after it warms from sunlight warming the lower atmosphere carbon dioxide the primary gas driving global warming has increased in concentration by about 50 since the preindustrial era to levels not seen for millions of years climate change has an increasingly large impact on the environment deserts are expanding while heat waves and wildfires are becoming more common amplified warming in the arctic has contributed to thawing permafrost retreat of glaciers and sea ice decline higher temperatures are also causing more intense storms droughts and other weather extremes rapid environmental change in mountains coral reefs and the arctic is forcing many species to relocate or become extinct even if efforts to minimize future warming are successful some effects will continue for centuries these include ocean heating ocean acidification and sea level rise climate change threatens people with increased flooding extreme heat increased food and water scarcity more disease and economic loss human migration and conflict can also be a result the world health organization calls climate change one of the biggest threats to global health in the 21st century societies and ecosystems will experience more severe risks without action to limit warming adapting to climate change through efforts like flood control measures or droughtresistant crops partially reduces climate change risks although some limits to adaptation have already been reached poorer communities are responsible for a small share of global emissions yet have the least ability to adapt and are most vulnerable to climate change many climate change impacts have been observed in the first decades of the 21st century with 2024 the warmest on record at 160 c 288 f since regular tracking began in 1850 additional warming will increase these impacts and can trigger tipping points such as melting all of the greenland ice sheet under the 2015 paris agreement nations collectively agreed to keep warming well under 2 c however with pledges made under the agreement global warming would still reach about 28 c 50 f by the end of the century there is widespread support for climate action worldwide and most countries aim to stop emitting carbon dioxide fossil fuels can be phased out by stopping subsidising them conserving energy and switching to energy sources that do not produce significant carbon pollution these energy sources include wind solar hydro and nuclear power cleanly generated electricity can replace fossil fuels for powering transportation heating buildings and running industrial processes carbon can also be removed from the atmosphere for instance by increasing forest cover and farming with methods that store carbon in soil terminology before the 1980s it was unclear whether the warming effect of increased greenhouse gases was stronger than the cooling effect of airborne particulates in air pollution scientists used the term inadvertent climate modification to refer to human impacts on the climate at this time in the 1980s the terms global warming and climate change became more common often being used interchangeably scientifically global warming refers only to increased global average surface temperature while climate change describes both global warming and its effects on earths climate system such as precipitation changes climate change can also be used more broadly to include changes to the climate that have happened throughout earths history global warmingused as early as 1975became the more popular term after nasa climate scientist james hansen used it in his 1988 testimony in the us senate since the 2000s usage of climate change has increased various scientists politicians and media may use the terms climate crisis or climate emergency to talk about climate change and may use the term global heating instead of global warming global temperature rise temperatures prior to presentday global warming over the last few million years the climate cycled through ice ages one of the hotter periods was the last interglacial around 125000 years ago where temperatures were between 05 c and 15 c warmer than before the start of global warming this period saw sea levels 5 to 10 metres higher than today the most recent glacial maximum 20000 years ago was some 57 c colder this period has sea levels that were over 125 metres 410 ft lower than today temperatures stabilized in the current interglacial period beginning 11700 years ago this period also saw the start of agriculture historical patterns of warming and cooling like the medieval warm period and the little ice age did not occur at the same time across different regions temperatures may have reached as high as those of the late 20th century in a limited set of regions climate information for that period comes from climate proxies such as trees and ice cores warming since the industrial revolution around 1850 thermometer records began to provide global coverage between the 18th century and 1970 there was little net warming as the warming impact of greenhouse gas emissions was offset by cooling from sulfur dioxide emissions sulfur dioxide causes acid rain but it also produces sulfate aerosols in the atmosphere which reflect sunlight and cause global dimming after 1970 the increasing accumulation of greenhouse gases and controls on sulfur pollution led to a marked increase in temperature ongoing changes in climate have had no precedent for several thousand years multiple datasets all show worldwide increases in surface temperature at a rate of around 02 c per decade the 20142023 decade warmed to an average 119 c 106130 c compared to the preindustrial baseline 18501900 not every single year was warmer than the last internal climate variability processes can make any year 02 c warmer or colder than the average from 1998 to 2013 negative phases of two such processes pacific decadal oscillation pdo and atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo caused a short slower period of warming called the global warming hiatus after the hiatus the opposite occurred with 2024 well above the recent average at more than 15 c this is why the temperature change is defined in terms of a 20year average which reduces the noise of hot and cold years and decadal climate patterns and detects the longterm signal a wide range of other observations reinforce the evidence of warming the upper atmosphere is cooling because greenhouse gases are trapping heat near the earths surface and so less heat is radiating into space warming reduces average snow cover and forces the retreat of glaciers at the same time warming also causes greater evaporation from the oceans leading to more atmospheric humidity more and heavier precipitation plants are flowering earlier in spring and thousands of animal species have been permanently moving to cooler areas differences by region different regions of the world warm at different rates the pattern is independent of where greenhouse gases are emitted because the gases persist long enough to diffuse across the planet since the preindustrial period the average surface temperature over land regions has increased almost twice as fast as the global average surface temperature this is because oceans lose more heat by evaporation and oceans can store a lot of heat the thermal energy in the global climate system has grown with only brief pauses since at least 1970 and over 90 of this extra energy has been stored in the ocean the rest has heated the atmosphere melted ice and warmed the continents the northern hemisphere and the north pole have warmed much faster than the south pole and southern hemisphere the northern hemisphere not only has much more land but also more seasonal snow cover and sea ice as these surfaces flip from reflecting a lot of light to being dark after the ice has melted they start absorbing more heat local black carbon deposits on snow and ice also contribute to arctic warming arctic surface temperatures are increasing between three and four times faster than in the rest of the world melting of ice sheets near the poles weakens both the atlantic and the antarctic limb of thermohaline circulation which further changes the distribution of heat and precipitation around the globe future global temperatures the world meteorological organization estimates there is almost a 50 chance of the fiveyear average global temperature exceeding 15 c between 2024 and 2028 the ipcc expects the 20year average to exceed 15 c in the early 2030s the ipcc sixth assessment report 2021 included projections that by 2100 global warming is very likely to reach 1018 c under a scenario with very low emissions of greenhouse gases 2135 c under an intermediate emissions scenario or 3357 c under a very high emissions scenario the warming will continue past 2100 in the intermediate and high emission scenarios with future projections of global surface temperatures by year 2300 being similar to millions of years ago the remaining carbon budget for staying beneath certain temperature increases is determined by modelling the carbon cycle and climate sensitivity to greenhouse gases according to unep global warming can be kept below 20 c with a 50 chance if emissions after 2023 do not exceed 900 gigatonnes of co2 this carbon budget corresponds to around 16 years of current emissions causes of recent global temperature rise the climate system experiences various cycles on its own which can last for years decades or even centuries for example el nio events cause shortterm spikes in surface temperature while la nia events cause short term cooling their relative frequency can affect global temperature trends on a decadal timescale other changes are caused by an imbalance of energy from external forcings examples of these include changes in the concentrations of greenhouse gases solar luminosity volcanic eruptions and variations in the earths orbit around the sun to determine the human contribution to climate change unique fingerprints for all potential causes are developed and compared with both observed patterns and known internal climate variability for example solar forcingwhose fingerprint involves warming the entire atmosphereis ruled out because only the lower atmosphere has warmed atmospheric aerosols produce a smaller cooling effect other drivers such as changes in albedo are less impactful greenhouse gases greenhouse gases are transparent to sunlight and thus allow it to pass through the atmosphere to heat the earths surface the earth radiates it as heat and greenhouse gases absorb a portion of it this absorption slows the rate at which heat escapes into space trapping heat near the earths surface and warming it over time while water vapour 50 and clouds 25 are the biggest contributors to the greenhouse effect they primarily change as a function of temperature and are therefore mostly considered to be feedbacks that change climate sensitivity on the other hand concentrations of gases such as co2 20 tropospheric ozone cfcs and nitrous oxide are added or removed independently from temperature and are therefore considered to be external forcings that change global temperatures before the industrial revolution naturally occurring amounts of greenhouse gases caused the air near the surface to be about 33 c warmer than it would have been in their absence human activity since the industrial revolution mainly extracting and burning fossil fuels coal oil and natural gas has increased the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere in 2022 the concentrations of co2 and methane had increased by about 50 and 164 respectively since 1750 these co2 levels are higher than they have been at any time during the last 14 million years concentrations of methane are far higher than they were over the last 800000 years global humancaused greenhouse gas emissions in 2019 were equivalent to 59 billion tonnes of co2 of these emissions 75 was co2 18 was methane 4 was nitrous oxide and 2 was fluorinated gases co2 emissions primarily come from burning fossil fuels to provide energy for transport manufacturing heating and electricity additional co2 emissions come from deforestation and industrial processes which include the co2 released by the chemical reactions for making cement steel aluminium and fertilizer methane emissions come from livestock manure rice cultivation landfills wastewater and coal mining as well as oil and gas extraction nitrous oxide emissions largely come from the microbial decomposition of fertilizer while methane only lasts in the atmosphere for an average of 12 years co2 lasts much longer the earths surface absorbs co2 as part of the carbon cycle while plants on land and in the ocean absorb most excess emissions of co2 every year that co2 is returned to the atmosphere when biological matter is digested burns or decays landsurface carbon sink processes such as carbon fixation in the soil and photosynthesis remove about 29 of annual global co2 emissions the ocean has absorbed 20 to 30 of emitted co2 over the last two decades co2 is only removed from the atmosphere for the long term when it is stored in the earths crust which is a process that can take millions of years to complete land surface changes around 30 of earths land area is largely unusable for humans glaciers deserts etc 26 is forests 10 is shrubland and 34 is agricultural land deforestation is the main land use change contributor to global warming as the destroyed trees release co2 and are not replaced by new trees removing that carbon sink between 2001 and 2018 27 of deforestation was from permanent clearing to enable agricultural expansion for crops and livestock another 24 has been lost to temporary clearing under the shifting cultivation agricultural systems 26 was due to logging for wood and derived products and wildfires have accounted for the remaining 23 some forests have not been fully cleared but were already degraded by these impacts restoring these forests also recovers their potential as a carbon sink local vegetation cover impacts how much of the sunlight gets reflected back into space albedo and how much heat is lost by evaporation for instance the change from a dark forest to grassland makes the surface lighter causing it to reflect more sunlight deforestation can also modify the release of chemical compounds that influence clouds and by changing wind patterns in tropic and temperate areas the net effect is to produce significant warming and forest restoration can make local temperatures cooler at latitudes closer to the poles there is a cooling effect as forest is replaced by snowcovered and more reflective plains globally these increases in surface albedo have been the dominant direct influence on temperature from land use change thus land use change to date is estimated to have a slight cooling effect other factors aerosols and clouds air pollution in the form of aerosols affects the climate on a large scale aerosols scatter and absorb solar radiation from 1961 to 1990 a gradual reduction in the amount of sunlight reaching the earths surface was observed this phenomenon is popularly known as global dimming and is primarily attributed to sulfate aerosols produced by the combustion of fossil fuels with heavy sulfur concentrations like coal and bunker fuel smaller contributions come from black carbon from combustion of fossil fuels and biomass and from dust globally aerosols have been declining since 1990 due to pollution controls meaning that they no longer mask greenhouse gas warming as much aerosols also have indirect effects on the earths energy budget sulfate aerosols act as cloud condensation nuclei and lead to clouds that have more and smaller cloud droplets these clouds reflect solar radiation more efficiently than clouds with fewer and larger droplets they also reduce the growth of raindrops which makes clouds more reflective to incoming sunlight indirect effects of aerosols are the largest uncertainty in radiative forcing while aerosols typically limit global warming by reflecting sunlight black carbon in soot that falls on snow or ice can contribute to global warming not only does this increase the absorption of sunlight it also increases melting and sealevel rise limiting new black carbon deposits in the arctic could reduce global warming by 02 c by 2050 the effect of decreasing sulfur content of fuel oil for ships since 2020 is estimated to cause an additional 005 c increase in global mean temperature by 2050 solar and volcanic activity as the sun is the earths primary energy source changes in incoming sunlight directly affect the climate system solar irradiance has been measured directly by satellites and indirect measurements are available from the early 1600s onwards since 1880 there has been no upward trend in the amount of the suns energy reaching the earth in contrast to the warming of the lower atmosphere the troposphere the upper atmosphere the stratosphere would also be warming if the sun was sending more energy to earth but instead it has been cooling this is consistent with greenhouse gases preventing heat from leaving the earths atmosphere explosive volcanic eruptions can release gases dust and ash that partially block sunlight and reduce temperatures or they can send water vapour into the atmosphere which adds to greenhouse gases and increases temperatures these impacts on temperature only last for several years because both water vapour and volcanic material have low persistence in the atmosphere volcanic co2 emissions are more persistent but they are equivalent to less than 1 of current humancaused co2 emissions volcanic activity still represents the single largest natural impact forcing on temperature in the industrial era yet like the other natural forcings it has had negligible impacts on global temperature trends since the industrial revolution climate change feedbacks the climate systems response to an initial forcing is shaped by feedbacks which either amplify or dampen the change selfreinforcing or positive feedbacks increase the response while balancing or negative feedbacks reduce it the main reinforcing feedbacks are the watervapour feedback the icealbedo feedback and the net cloud feedback the primary balancing mechanism is radiative cooling as earths surface gives off more heat to space in response to rising temperature in addition to temperature feedbacks there are feedbacks in the carbon cycle such as the fertilizing effect of co2 on plant growth feedbacks are expected to trend in a positive direction as greenhouse gas emissions continue raising climate sensitivity these feedback processes alter the pace of global warming for instance warmer air can hold more moisture in the form of water vapour which is itself a potent greenhouse gas warmer air can also make clouds higher and thinner and therefore more insulating increasing climate warming the reduction of snow co",
