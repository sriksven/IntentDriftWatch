    "cmv england should be 95 white cmv since at least the 1970s the british public have been staunchly and consistently against immigration with gallup and many other major polls confirming this for example enoch powell having the support of 75 of the public it is undemocratic and tyrannical that the will of the people has been so flagrantly ignored in more recent history for at least the past 30 years probably longer each government has pledged to reduce and control immigration only for it to increase at least from john major through new labour all the conservative fuckups and now starmer this is against the will of the british people and always has been it has been foisted upon them against their will and the promises of every single government history shows rulers exploit ethnic linguistic or religious diversity to strengthen central rule where elites are small and the ruled are many and divided a government can maintain control by coopting particular groups recruiting outsiders or favouring minority elites who depend on the state for status and income they also use these populations in order to prop up their regimes foreigners are less likely to share local ties family networks or factional loyalties with the population and local elites so they can be more dependable for suppressing dissent and tilting the balance toward the ruler we see this in modern democracies with voting blocks brought into the country a few short historical examples include the qing dynasty using the manchu to suppress the far larger population of han theres also the varangian guard the swiss guard mamluks jannisaries etc their foreignness being a deliberate characteristic to enhance regime security if it be therefore the natural property of small states to be governed as a republic of middling ones to be subject to a monarch and of large empires to be swayed by a despotic prince i do not want the diversity which necessitates a stronger bigger more fascistic state different races do not feel comfortable policing each others behaviours society is thereby less cohesive there is less common interest and cause and union among common people this creates reliance on heavyhanded government solutions norman sicily is a clear historical example a small conquering elite ruling over a highly diverse population and deliberately exploiting that diversity and importing or coopting outsiders to build and hold centralised power by distributing patronage across groups giving privileges to muslim townsmen appointing greek taxreceivers rewarding lombard barons selectively the crown created dependence cleavages between local elites and the throne the elites interests became aligned with keeping norman rule in place rather than with mounting unified resistance the great influx of people has increased the labour supply housing demand and the balance of power between labour and capital in the billionaires favour has given power and influence to the billionaire class by lowering the average working mans bargaining power for wages etc supply and demand houses would be cheaper if theres less people vying for them and would keep getting cheaper as our population decreases and more become available people can demand more wages if theres a limited number of workers like we saw during the plague and many other examples that shift weakens workers bargaining position and concentrates gains among owners of capital and land immigration is a redisbutive mechanism for the rich welfare for billionaires theres also some intangible element of it i simply dont like india was right to kick out the british born in india the british colonisers were not indian just because they lived and were born there a dog born in a stable is not a horse id like to maintain the worlds beautiful rich and diverse tapestry i dont want a dull beige world where every country looks the same i want distinct peoples and ideas and aesthetics aristotle i think helps describe further for just as the addition of new settlers changes the character of a city as when foreigners share in it so does the change of one part of the citizen body in relation to another hence it is right to say that the same city is preserved so long as the race genos of its inhabitants remains the same but not otherwise in short i think england should be english we didnt ask for it we elected people who promised not to do it that alone is enough for me but theres also many other downsides as notedz and many i have not in practical terms like language barriers",

    "constitutional law electoral laws appointment of ec legal reasoning new question 2025 in anoop baranwal v union of india 2023 the supreme court held that the chief election commissioner cec and election commissioners ecs would henceforth be appointed by a threemember committee consisting of the prime minister the leader of the opposition and the chief justice of india until parliament enacts a law under article 3242 of the constitution article 324 provides for the election commission which has the superintendence direction and control of elections while parliament made a law in 1991 regarding the tenure and conditions of service under article 3245 it has not enacted any law concerning appointments under article 3242 justice km joseph and justice ajay rastogi reasoned that the framers intended to insulate the election commission from executive dominance but left the method of appointment to parliament since no such law exists and given the election commissions vital role in ensuring free and fair elections a cornerstone of constitutional democracy the court found it necessary to fill this constitutional vacuum relying on both historical and structural interpretation the court held that the absence of a law allowing the prime minister to effectively control appointments creates an imbalance that threatens the independence of the election commission and consequently the constitutional right to vote and the freedom of elections hence the court stepped in to bridge the gap similar to what it did in vishaka v state of rajasthan to safeguard constitutional values until parliament acts questions 1 what was the principal reason the supreme court altered the process for appointing election commissioners a because the existing procedure had led to electoral malpractice b because parliament had failed to enact a law under article 3242 ensuring independence c because the constitution expressly required judicial participation in appointments d because the chief justice demanded it through a suo motu proceeding 2 the courts intervention in anoop baranwal is most analogous to which earlier case a kesavananda bharati v state of kerala b vishaka v state of rajasthan c maneka gandhi v union of india d indira nehru gandhi v raj narain 3 according to the passage which of the following best describes the courts reasoning about the right to vote a it is a purely statutory right b it is a constitutional right derived from article 326 c it is a natural right that exists independently of the constitution d it is a privilege conferred by the election commission 4 the framers of the constitution intended parliament to make a law regarding appointments under article 3242 because a they wished to keep the process free from executive control b they wanted the prime minister to have complete discretion c they believed judicial appointments would be unconstitutional d they intended to centralize election control within the executive branch 5 suppose parliament now enacts a law that gives the prime minister sole power to appoint election commissioners based on the reasoning in the passage such a law would most likely a be upheld since article 3242 allows parliament to legislate freely b be struck down as it would defeat the purpose of ensuring independence of the election commission c be valid since the president must still formally make the appointment d be beyond judicial review as it involves a political question",

    "does the last election validate the senate dems strategy it seems to me that you could read the last election results as a vindication for senate dems ive had and have a lot of problems with them and the strategy but i did try to understand it and i kind of feel like it did what it was supposed to weve all had the experience of listening to some senior dem talk about how focusing on the foreign black site prisons or the violence of the masked and unaccountable ice agents is just a distraction from the price of eggs its infuriating or at least thats my reaction to it but i dont think theyre saying those things because they really think cecot was a distraction instead they say those things because it minimizes the attack surface they present to trump and because it wont trigger the large number of people in the country who really really hate dems after the election they were faced with the fact that a lot of people dont really like or trust them sarah has played focus group audio of biden voters who went for trump talking about this stuff dems were also faced with what has turned out to be an immediate existential crisis for our democracy a problem that couldnt be postponed until they somehow got their act together on messaging schumers lack of action or even of much in the way of comments is extremely aggravating to me so much so that i have actually vowed to myself never to vote for him again hes my senator but it didnt really aggravate maga people it was so weak and milquetoasty that it was basically invisible to them the dems made a deliberate choice to do this to throw me under the bus so that they could focus on not drawing fire from the right a few months ago i heard carville on molly jongs podcast explain his theory of the landscape and i think it explains why dems made this choice he talked about the cook partisan voting index pvi report a lot he said look dems couldnt lose aocs seat in queens if they tried you cant base your message on what people in that district want to hear you have to base it on what people who could go either way want to hear he didnt use the word but its a triangulation strategy if im already going to vote for dems no matter what and i am no matter how much i rage against them there is no electoral value whatsoever in giving me anything more that i want and if they can say something that will piss me off but make that swing voter in iowa come over to their side it makes electoral sense to do so you can attack this on moral or policy grounds but it seems kind of airtight on electoral grounds and as carville says if you dont win you cant do anything so your policy positions dont matter because you dont matter and it seems to me that weve had our faces rubbed in that lesson every single day of the second trump administration if youre going to give senate dems this sympathetic read and say this was the plan all along it seems like it worked because what we saw last week was all of the negativity and bad feelings that trump has brought down on himself dragging maga down while bad feelings about dems played virtually no role at all in any major outcome the real downside of this sort of thing the dems are doing in purely machiavellian terms is that it taints the dems with an aura of inauthenticity when they talk about distractions it reduces their attack surface but it also prevents them from talking to me sincerely and thats absolutely clear to me and it doesnt make me think well of them and to sort of connect this back into the great circle of life i think this kind of inauthenticity is a big part of the reason that sarahs focus group people find dems untrustworthy in the first place thats just my uninformed take after listening to her show in the wake of the 2024 catastrophe though during the first government funding showdown of this term i read joshs marshalls stuff about what dems were doing and it had a big effect on me my reaction was basically that i didnt know what the right thing to do was and that i tend to think that a bunch of people who have won senate races know more about politics than i do i mean im filled with doubt about everything i always come up with an argument try to poke holes in it lose faith in my position flip over then flip back so my problem wasnt with the cave itself my problem was with the way they were engineering the cave by figuring out whod be given permission to vote for cloture while they were putting out messaging about how they were fighting like hell against it the combination of that disingenuous messaging and the focus group recording of biden voters who went to trump who said i just dont believe anything they say had a big impact on me i kept thinking about how id try to persuade those people basically it would come down to i understand and even share your concerns about dems but trust me trump is going to be a million times worse which while true isnt super persuasive you really want to be able to say our people arent lying to you after the election ive heard people say this shows that dems should push further left or this shows that dems should fight harder but it was a total rout so why doesnt it mean that they should keep doing what theyve been doing",

    "how large and how effective is iglesia ni cristos bloc vote a lot of people mention that less than 3 percent line so heres what the actual numbers and math could look like the philippine statistics authority recorded 1762845 members in 2000 2251941 in 2010 and 2806524 in 2020 from 2000 to 2020 that shows an average growth rate of about 235 percent per year using the same average rate the number would reach about 3152517 members by 2025 with a philippine population of about 1168 million and around 108 million filipinos living overseas the total filipino population worldwide is about 1276 million that means iglesia ni cristo members make up only 247 percent of all filipinos this estimate treats all iglesia ni cristo members as if they were filipino even though the church also counts nonfilipinos in its worldwide total the goal is to keep the ratio simple and easy to compare in an estimated 68 million registered voters counting every projected member as a voter would equal about 464 percent of the electorate that is the raw share to stay realistic assume 80 percent of members are adults and 90 to 100 percent follow the directive using 90 percent for obedience gives 72 percent of members who likely cast bloc votes or about 2269812 people that adjusted bloc equals about 334 percent of all registered voters on a national scale these shares are small but in close elections where margins can fall below a few hundred thousand votes they can still make a difference when the churchs leadership instructs members to vote as one that creates a bloc that very few organizations in the country can match in discipline and coordination the bloc does not choose the president by itself yet it can strengthen whoever is already leading candidates often seek iglesia ni cristos endorsement because even a 12 edge can secure victory in a tight race because iglesia ni cristo leaders usually announce their endorsements close to election day the timing gives the impression of momentum and confirmation for the chosen candidate in a country where many elections are decided by narrow margins a bloc that votes almost entirely in one direction can influence results far more than its size would suggest its strength comes from organization loyalty and timing so while iglesia ni cristo members make up only a small part of the total population their collective obedience at the polls gives the church an influence that reaches far beyond their numbers it is worth asking how much real change could happen if this kind of unity in voting were also used for transparency education and accountability instead of just elections",

    "five years since victory in karabakh exactly 5 years ago on this date azerbaijan emerged victorious from the second karabakh war this victory was a gargantuan paradigm shift in the caucasus only matched by the collapse of the ussr foreign policy effects of 8 november have been wellstudied but what about domestic the war is the culmination of ilhams pivoting toward azeri revanchism circa 2012 since ilham merely inherited the throne from his chekist daddy even the nakhchivan clan distrusted him just continuing heydars policies was becoming insufficient by the late 2000s as evidenced by diplomatic cable leaks so ilham decided to coopt his rivals nationalism opposition in azerbaijan traditionally represented by pfa and musavat since 1993 was always more nationalist than the government while heydar almost gave karabakh to armenia in exchange for a corridor to nakhchivan in 2001 channels like ans called for total war in karabakh and lambasted even the idea of negotiations with the dishonorable rfsizlr widespread protests that took place in the spring of 2011 marked the first time the millennial youth not elchibeyera boomers attended the protests en masse coupled with the bolotnaya movement in russia that took place the same year ilham was seriously terrified of a potential color revolution in azerbaijan he had to do something so he decided to outdo the opposition in nationalism by pardoning murderer ramil safarov in 2012 despite outrage from azerbaijani intellectuals the masses enthusiastically supported the move ilham continued to exploit nationalism throughout 2010s sensationalizing the april 2016 clashes and abandoning negotiations with armenia on karabakh the popular view of him began to change despite the regime torturing hundreds of innocent officers in tartar in 2017 the masses became increasingly supportive of aliyev as can be evidenced by rapidly shrinking annual pfa protest attendance barely a few hundred came on the streets in 2019 most elchibeyera boomers all he needed was a military victory to top off his campaign of legitimizing and consolidating his rule 2020 was a finely executed stage play of ilham noble officer hashimov was martyred by armenians the people called for revenge against the enemy and the victorious president delivered his on promise for revenge against armenians karabakh march and the war were a result of a carefully calculated 8year long gambit to coopt the azerbaijani nationalist movement and integrate it into ilhams system which may explain the popular conspiracy theory that najmaddin sadiqov leaked hashimovs coordinates to armenians by seizing shusha on november 8 the opposition lost its raison detre the only argument that resonated with the masses against ilham was that he stalled the reconquista of karabakh for his shady goals now that he managed to not only return karabakh but also get turkish support unlike elchibey it got utterly smitten ilham now had the strongest legitimization the liberator of karabakh none of the protests after 2020 not for tartar case not in imishli called for his resignation only for corrupt officials who deceived the victorious president even the opposition critique of not fully taking karabakh became moot in september 2023 so 8 november gave ilham the ultimate carte blanche to eliminate not just present but potential opposition akin to kronos devouring his progeny after abolishing nkr in september 2023 the government began quickly mopping up what was left of the uncontrolled civil society in azerbaijan by busting abzasmedia toplum tv meclisinfo and meydan tv now that ulviyya ali last free journalist and ramiz mehdiyev last heydar official are both behind bars ilham completed the transformation of azerbaijan into aliyevstan power of the aliyev clan is now completely unlimited with azerbaijan becoming a personal fiefdom of the clan pasha holding owns most of the country and ilham aliyevs soninlaw emin agalarov gets preferential treatment from the government allowing to open a casino in sea breeze azeri masses are back to their default state of being asleep now that karabakh is back the economy is stable and how can we even doubt the victorious president the unprecedented apathy and lack of participation in 2024 snap presidential elections indicate that azerbaijan has returned to sovietera authoritarian boredom the intelligentsia has lost all hope and is leaving the country en masse 8 november allowed aliyev to totally consolidate power and turn azerbaijan into his fiefdom any sort of internal instability causing a regime change is now impossible ilham aliyev will easily surpass stalins reign by 2029 and so victory day should also be called aliyev day at the end of the day azerbaijanis dont care that much for democracy pfa and musavat used such buzzwords just because they were the opposite of what aliyev was doing not because they actually understood those concepts most azerbaijanis are okay with becoming aliyevstani they made a conscious choice of getting karabakh back in exchange for being under aliyevs for the foreseeable future",

    "phalanx vs legion battle of magnesia at the beginning of the 2nd century bce two major powers vied for the mediterranean in the west the romans had recently defeated the carthaginians and having crossed to greece the macedonians concurrently antiochus iii 223187bce king of the seleucid empire earned the title the great by reestablishing seleucid power in asia minor seizing syria from the ptolemies and campaigning in central asia after the roman victory over the macedonians at cynoscephalae in 197 bce greece was contested by the romans and seleucids neither initially desired war but in less than a decade they were drawn into a fateful clash that ended at magnesia after their removal of macedonian control over greece in 197 bce the romans did something unexpected they withdrew their legions and proclaimed the greeks free the various greek citystates federal leagues and kingdoms were to govern themselves this roman settlement created ambiguity roman troops had withdrawn but everyone still looked expectantly or nervously across the adriatic to rome few could doubt that the romans were a major power in greece but the limits of their interest were uncertain while the romans were proclaiming the freedom of the greeks antiochus was bolstering the seleucid empire in asia minor this saw the seleucids take or threaten cities previously under the control of the macedonians places that the romans could claim they had liberated crossing into europe antiochus built a strong seleucid presence in thrace for antiochus he was within his rights as a hellenistic king to reestablish control over the territory which his ancestors had held diplomatic exchanges between antiochus and rome in the years 197192 bce were cautious and tense but not overtly hostile some scholars have suggested that while neither side pushed for war there was a misunderstanding that drove them to it antiochus controlled his empire through direct occupation or treaties roman control was more informal and based on political friendship and the propaganda of freedom for the greeks what to the romans looked like an area under their influence and bound to them seemed to antiochus a land the romans had little interest in and one which in some regions at least was well within his dynastys sphere of interest it was the smaller powers between the two empires that provoked war the seleucid revival in asia minor left the small attalid kingdom of pergamon vulnerable king eumenes ii 197159 bce turned down a seleucid alliance and talked up the danger of antiochus this task was not difficult antiochus advances in thrace could be seen as threatening to both the roman settlement of greece and ultimately italy these fears grew when romes bitterest enemy hannibal the carthaginian visited antiochus court in 195 bce in greece the aitolian federal state had grown dissatisfied with its previous partnership with the romans as they looked to secure their ambitions they turned to antiochus in 192 bce the aitolians attempted to seize control of central and southern greece a series of coups they plotted largely failed but with the situation in greece now unstable they called on antiochus to arbitrate their disputes with the romans antiochus seized the opportunity if the roman settlement in greece could be replaced by a seleucid system of alliances there would be no more need to negotiate with the romans about how their policy of freedom applied to seleucid lands at the very least any future war would take place in greece and antiochus would gain allies antiochus badly miscalculated the roman reaction in late 192 bce he landed in greece with a small force of up to 18000 troops clearly looking to the aitolians and future greek allies for support while they did make progress and some reluctant allies the roman response was decisive and soon the legions were dispatched back to greece according to grainger the limited size of antiochus force may show that the king did not expect the romans to fight and that a lighter presence was more likely to win over greek allies but it meant that antiochus was not prepared to fight in greece he hastily retreated to the famous mountain pass at thermopylae in 191 bce but was defeated trying to hold the pass having received little support from the greekseven the aitolians sent only a small force to thermopylaeantiochus was forced to withdraw to asia the greek expedition was over less than a year after it had begun invasion of asia after the disaster in greece hannibal warned antiochus that the romans would not stop in europe the king tried to negotiate but following their swift victory and with more reinforcements on the way the romans were uninterested while the roman army dealt with the aitolians in greece the combined forces of rome rhodes and pergamon fought for control of the aegean sea the rhodians played a crucial role as they prevented hannibal from bringing reinforcements and froze him out of the war before joining the romans to defeat the seleucid fleet at myonessus in 190 bce having lost control of the sea antiochus withdrew from the coast and prepared himself in the center of asia minor the roman invasion force under the recently elected consul lucius cornelius scipio could now make over to asia this command had been secured by the consuls more famous brother publius scipio africanus the most renowned roman general of his day and the man who had defeated hannibal antiochus made one final bid for peace after the romans landed in asia however there was no sense of compromise from the romans and the terms offered imposed heavy costs on the seleucids and demanded the surrender of all asia minor antiochus could not agree to these terms and withdrew from the coast some 60 kilometers inland and awaited the romans at magnesia and sipylum advance to magnesia the scipios led the first roman army to reach asia consisting of 30000 to 40000 troops to confront antiochus at its core were 20000 heavy infantry consisting of two roman legions and two italian latin contingents each around 5400 strong 3000 lightly armed pergamene and achaian troops and 3000 cavalry of which 800 were again from pergamon were to support the battlewinning infantry smaller numbers of cretans macedonians and thracians made up the rest of the army the romans were also accompanied by 16 african elephants though they played little part in the battle and were kept back as they were outnumbered by antiochus larger indian elephants the seleucid army was said to be much larger and much more diverse while our sources claim antiochus was relaxed about the prospect of a roman invasion of asia he had made extensive preparations according to professor bezalel barkochva the army antiochus gathered at magnesia drew on the resources of his vast empire and gathered 60000 infantry and 12000 cavalry at its heart was the famed macedonian phalanx of massed pikemen these 16000 soldiers would form the center of antiochus line the nearby regions of cappodocia and galatia provided contingents with others coming from seleucid territories in media modern iran split into two equal contingents were 6000 cataphracts heavily armored horsemen macedonian armies had a long cavalry tradition but the addition of armor was an innovation antiochus may have picked up from campaigns further east another notable feature of this army was the deployment of scythed chariots with blades sticking out from the wheels these chariots looked terrifying and had been used before by the seleucids without becoming a common feature in late 190 bce some accounts put the battle in january 189 bce these two armies stood at opposite ends of a flat plain between two rivers outside magnesia the romans were outnumbered but the sources generally give the impression that the romans were confident and eager for battle the romans had defeated hellenistic armies before roman victories in greece and the aegean and antiochus abandonment of his territories in europe at the roman approach surely boosted their confidence further battle of magnesia after the arrival of the romans at magnesia neither side moved antiochus on chosen ground could wait for the romans to come to him lucius scipio could not it was late in the year and the romans had to decide whether to fight or disburse to winter quarters after some hesitation scipio ordered the army to advance to a slightly narrower part of the plain seeing the enemy advance antiochus also decided the time for battle had come the romans deployed their forces in their traditional formation with three lines of heavy infantry in the center eumenes with the pergamene and greek cavalry and auxiliaries on the right and their left next to a river antiochus largely matched this layout but with some interesting variations interspersed among the phalanx in the center were groups of elephants adding to the terrifying spectacle of the wall of pikemen to both the left and the right antiochus stationed his cataphracts and supporting cavalry the king himself was with the right wing while to the left the scythed chariots lined up the day of the battle began with mist and clouds which reduced visibility the later roman historian livy states this gave an early advantage to the romans since antiochus larger army was so spread out that the king could not see the full picture across the battlefield once the battle began antiochus plan became clear this was not to be another battle between legion and phalanx instead antiochus pinned his hopes on his cataphracts and chariots the plan started with spectacular success the armored cavalry of the seleucid right under antiochus himself smashed through the roman lines by the river this was a rare occasion in which the heavy infantry of the romans was broken by a cavalry charge following up this success was more difficult the roman left was broken but not destroyed and enough troops rallied around the roman camp to halt antiochus momentum forcing the king to eventually turn around without achieving anything decisive in contrast to the success on the right everything went wrong on the seleucid left the use of scythed chariots backfired as the romans and eumunes targeted the horses with javelins arrows and sling stones until they became uncontrollable the panicking horses turned back into their own lines disrupting the cataphracts seeing the disorder eumenes charged and suddenly the seleucid left was fleeing in the center a similar story played out the elephants stationed among the phalanx to give it extra strength became uncontrollable when targeted as they broke they disrupted the cohesion the phalanx relied on to survive and the seleucid center joined the left in its rout by the time antiochus understood what was happening it was too late roman sources claim more than 50000 seleucids were killed at the cost of less than 400 romans and greeks the numbers are probably exaggerated but once the infantry in the center was isolated it is unlikely many survived the massacre antiochus approach to the battle deserves some comment a much later historian appian criticizes antiochus for concentrating on his cavalry rather than the phalanx which he left crowded in a narrow space the innovation of placing elephants within the phalanx also did more harm than good however it is possible that the focus on cavalry shows a clear line of thought from antiochus and an attempt to overcome previous failures antiochus was well aware that hellenistic armies with their focus on the phalanx had struggled and been defeated by roman legions he was wellinformed about the defeat of the macedonian phalanx at cynoscephalae in 197 bce during the expedition to greece he had sent officers to the battlefield there roman legions had broken up and destroyed a phalanx antiochus therefore avoided another contest of phalanx and legion the turn to heavy cavalry and chariots was an attempt to innovate and win the battle elsewhere rather than simply waiting for the phalanx to lose against the legions on the right this plan worked modern historians like grainger and barkochva argue that the failure was in the use of chariots a previously unreliable weapon and the inadequate protection for them against enemy skirmishers the plan he came up with for the battle of magnesia shows antiochus was an intelligent and innovative commander unfortunately he may have learnt the wrong lesson from cynoscephalae that battle was fought on uneven ground allowing the more flexible roman legionnaires to disrupt the tight formation of the phalanx the flat plain of magnesia could have been a more suitable place to test the phalanx against the legion on its favored terrain end of seleucid asia minor as antiochus fell back toward syria after the defeat seleucid power in asia minor and anatolia went with him a peace was soon agreed the peace of apamea its terms spelled the end of seleucid rule north of the taurus mountains essentially the seleucids lost all of modern turkey as they had done in greece the romans would not take these lands directly instead rhodes and pergamon who had both been essential to the roman victory divided the lands between them the seleucid empire was not finished yet but in a short war that lasted just over two years 192190 bce the romans had wiped out the progress antiochus had spent decades on in the west stripped of some of its richest provinces the seleucids would never recover bibliography barkochva b 2008 the seleucid army

    "an election is a formal group decisionmaking process whereby a population chooses an individual or multiple individuals to hold public office elections have been the usual mechanism by which modern representative democracy has operated since the 17th century elections may fill offices in the legislature sometimes in the executive and judiciary and for regional and local government such as cities or towns this process is also used in many other standardized associations public businesses and organizations from clubs to voluntary association and corporations the global use of elections as a tool for selecting representatives in modern representative democracies is in contrast with the practice in the democratic archetype ancient athens where the elections were considered an oligarchic institution and most political offices were filled using allotment which is also known as sortition by which office holders were chosen by lot electoral reform describes the process of introducing fair electoral systems where they are not in place or improving the fairness or effectiveness of existing systems psephology is the study of results and other statistics relating to elections especially with a view to predicting future results election is the fact of electing or being elected to elect means to select or to nominate and so sometimes other forms of ballot such as referendums are referred to as elections especially in the united states history elections were used as early in history as ancient greece and ancient rome and throughout the medieval period to select rulers such as the holy roman emperor see imperial election and the pope see papal election the pala king gopala ruled c 750s 770s ce in early medieval bengal was elected by a group of feudal chieftains such elections were quite common in contemporary societies of the region in the chola empire around 920 ce in uthiramerur in presentday tamil nadu palm leaves were used for selecting the village committee members the leaves with candidate names written on them were put inside a mud pot to select the committee members a young boy was asked to take out as many leaves as the number of positions available this was known as the kudavolai system the first recorded popular elections of officials to public office by majority vote where all citizens were eligible both to vote and to hold public office date back to the ephors of sparta in 754 bc under the mixed government of the spartan constitution athenian democratic elections where all citizens could hold public office were not introduced for another 247 years until the reforms of cleisthenes under the earlier solonian constitution c 574 bc all athenian citizens were eligible to vote in the popular assemblies on matters of law and policy and as jurors but only the three highest classes of citizens could vote in elections nor were the lowest of the four classes of athenian citizens as defined by the extent of their wealth and property rather than by birth eligible to hold public office through the reforms of solon the spartan election of the ephors therefore also predates the reforms of solon in athens by approximately 180 years questions of suffrage especially suffrage for minority groups have dominated the history of elections males the dominant cultural group in north america and europe often dominated the electorate and continue to do so in many countries early elections in countries such as the united kingdom and the united states were dominated by landed or ruling class males by 1920 all western european and north american democracies had universal adult male suffrage except switzerland and many countries began to consider womens suffrage despite legally mandated universal suffrage for adult males political barriers were sometimes erected to prevent fair access to elections see civil rights movement contexts elections are held in a variety of political organizational and corporate settings many countries hold elections to select people to serve in their governments but other types of organizations hold elections as well for example many corporations hold elections among shareholders to select a board of directors and these elections may be mandated by corporate law in many places an election to the government is usually a competition among people who have already won a primary election within a political party elections within corporations and other organizations often use procedures and rules that are similar to those of governmental elections electorate suffrage the question of who may vote is a central issue in elections the electorate does not generally include the entire population for example many countries prohibit those who are under the age of majority from voting all jurisdictions require a minimum age for voting in australia aboriginal people were not given the right to vote until 1962 see 1967 referendum entry and in 2010 the federal government removed the rights of prisoners serving for three years or more to vote a large proportion of whom were aboriginal australians suffrage is typically only for citizens of the country though further limits may be imposed in the european union one can vote in municipal elections if one lives in the municipality and is an eu citizen the nationality of the country of residence is not required in some countries voting is required by law eligible voters may be subject to punitive measures such as a fine for not casting a vote in western australia the penalty for a first time offender failing to vote is a 2000 fine which increases to 5000 if the offender refused to vote prior voting population historically the size of eligible voters the electorate was small having the size of groups or communities of privileged men like aristocrats and men of a city citizens with the growth of the number of people with bourgeois citizen rights outside of cities expanding the term citizen the electorates grew to numbers beyond the thousands elections with an electorate in the hundred thousands appeared in the final decades of the roman republic by extending voting rights to citizens outside of rome with the lex julia of 90 bc reaching an electorate of 910000 and estimated voter turnout of maximum 10 in 70 bc only again comparable in size to the first elections of the united states at the same time the kingdom of great britain had in 1780 about 214000 eligible voters 3 of the whole population naturalization can reshape the electorate of a country candidates a representative democracy requires a procedure to govern nomination for political office in many cases nomination for office is mediated through preselection processes in organized political parties nonpartisan systems tend to be different from partisan systems as concerns nominations in a direct democracy one type of nonpartisan democracy any eligible person can be nominated although elections were used in ancient athens in rome and in the selection of popes and holy roman emperors the origins of elections in the contemporary world lie in the gradual emergence of representative government in europe and north america beginning in the 17th century in some systems no nominations take place at all with voters free to choose any person at the time of votingwith some possible exceptions such as through a minimum age requirementin the jurisdiction in such cases it is not required or even possible that the members of the electorate be familiar with all of the eligible persons though such systems may involve indirect elections at larger geographic levels to ensure that some firsthand familiarity among potential electees can exist at these levels ie among the elected delegates systems electoral systems are the detailed constitutional arrangements and voting systems that convert the vote into a political decision the first step is for voters to cast the ballots which may be simple singlechoice ballots but other types such as multiple choice or ranked ballots may also be used then the votes are tallied for which various vote counting systems may be used and the voting system then determines the result on the basis of the tally most systems can be categorized as either proportional majoritarian or mixed among the proportional systems the most commonly used are partylist proportional representation list pr systems among majoritarian are firstpastthepost electoral system single winner plurality voting and different methods of majority voting such as the widely used tworound system mixed systems combine elements of both proportional and majoritarian methods with some typically producing results closer to the former mixedmember proportional or the other eg parallel voting many countries have growing electoral reform movements which advocate systems such as approval voting single transferable vote instant runoff voting or a condorcet method these methods are also gaining popularity for lesser elections in some countries where more important elections still use more traditional counting methods while openness and accountability are usually considered cornerstones of a democratic system the act of casting a vote and the content of a voters ballot are usually an important exception the secret ballot is a relatively modern development but it is now considered crucial in most free and fair elections as it limits the effectiveness of intimidation campaigns when elections are called politicians and their supporters attempt to influence policy by competing directly for the votes of constituents in what are called campaigns supporters for a campaign can be either formally organized or loosely affiliated and frequently utilize campaign advertising it is common for political scientists to attempt to predict elections via political forecasting methods the most expensive election campaign included us7 billion spent on the 2012 united states presidential election and is followed by the us5 billion spent on the 2014 indian general election timing the nature of democracy is that elected officials are accountable to the people and they must return to the voters at prescribed intervals to seek their mandate to continue in office for that reason most democratic constitutions provide that elections are held at fixed regular intervals in the united states elections for public offices are typically held between every two and six years in most states and at the federal level with exceptions for elected judicial positions that may have longer terms of office there is a variety of schedules for example presidents the president of ireland is elected every seven years the president of russia and the president of finland every six years the president of france every five years president of the united states every four years predetermined or fixed election dates have the advantage of fairness and predictability they tend to greatly lengthen campaigns and make dissolving the legislature parliamentary system more problematic if the date should happen to fall at a time when dissolution is inconvenient eg when war breaks out other states eg the united kingdom only set maximum time in office and the executive decides exactly when within that limit it will actually go to the polls in practice this means the government remains in power for close to its full term and chooses an election date it calculates to be in its best interests unless something special happens such as a motion of noconfidence this calculation depends on a number of variables such as its performance in opinion polls and the size of its majority postponing elections beyond the full term has been associated with democratic backsliding snap elections are early elections before the full term of office rolling elections are elections in which all representatives in a body are elected but these elections are spread over a period of time rather than all at once examples are the presidential primaries in the united states elections to the european parliament where due to differing election laws in each member state elections are held on different days of the same week and due to logistics general elections in lebanon and india the voting procedure in the legislative assemblies of the roman republic are also a classical example in rolling elections voters have information about previous voters choices while in the first elections there may be plenty of hopeful candidates in the last rounds consensus on one winner is generally achieved in todays context of rapid communication candidates can put disproportionate resources into competing strongly in the first few stages because those stages affect the reaction of latter stages undemocratic or unfair in many of the countries with weak rule of law the most common reason why elections do not meet international standards of being free and fair is interference from the incumbent government dictators may use the powers of the executive police martial law censorship physical implementation of the election mechanism etc to remain in power despite popular opinion in favour of removal members of a particular faction in a legislature may use the power of the majority or supermajority passing criminal laws and defining the electoral mechanisms including eligibility and district boundaries to prevent the balance of power in the body from shifting to a rival faction due to an election nongovernmental entities can also interfere with elections through physical force verbal intimidation or fraud which can result in improper casting or counting of votes monitoring for and minimizing electoral fraud is also an ongoing task in countries with strong traditions of free and fair elections problems that prevent an election from being free and fair take various forms lack of open political debate or an informed electorate the electorate may be poorly informed about issues or candidates due to lack of freedom of the press lack of objectivity in the press due to state or corporate control or lack of access to news and political media freedom of speech may be curtailed by the state favouring certain viewpoints or state propaganda scheduling frequent elections can also lead to voter fatigue violation of political egalitarianism gerrymandering wasted votes and manipulating electoral thresholds can prevent that all votes count equally interference with campaigns exclusion of opposition candidates from eligibility for office needlessly high nomination rules on who may be a candidate are some of the ways the structure of an election can be changed to favour a specific faction or candidate those in power may arrest or assassinate candidates suppress or even criminalize campaigning close campaign headquarters harass or beat campaign workers or intimidate voters with violence foreign electoral intervention can also occur with the united states interfering between 1946 and 2000 in 81 elections and russia or the soviet union in 36 in 2018 the most intense interventions utilizing false information were by china in taiwan and by russia in latvia the next highest levels were in bahrain qatar and hungary tampering with mechanisms this can include falsifying voter instructions violation of the secret ballot ballot stuffing tampering with voting machines destruction of legitimately cast ballots voter suppression voter registration fraud failure to validate voter residency fraudulent tabulation of results and use of physical force or verbal intimation at polling places other examples include persuading candidates not to run such as through blackmailing bribery intimidation or physical violence shams a sham election or show election is an election that is held purely for show that is without any significant political choice or real impact on the results of the election sham elections are a common event in dictatorial regimes that feel the need to feign the appearance of public legitimacy published results usually show high voter turnout and high support typically at least 80 and close to 100 in many cases for the prescribed candidates or for the referendum choice that favours the political party in power dictatorial regimes can also organize sham elections with results simulating those that might be achieved in democratic countries sometimes only one governmentapproved candidate is allowed to run in sham elections with no opposition candidates allowed or opposition candidates are arrested on false charges or even without any charges before the election to prevent them from running ballots may contain only one yes option or in the case of a simple yes or no question security forces often persecute people who pick no thus encouraging them to pick the yes option in other cases those who vote receive stamps in their passport for doing so while those who did not vote and thus do not receive stamps are persecuted as enemies of the people sham elections can sometimes backfire against the party in power especially if the regime believes they are popular enough to win without coercion fraud or suppressing the opposition the most famous example of this was the 1990 myanmar general election in which the governmentsponsored national unity party suffered a landslide defeat by the opposition national league for democracy and consequently the results were annulled aristocratic some scholars argue that the predominance of elections in modern liberal democracies masks the fact that they are actually aristocratic selection mechanisms that deny each citizen an equal chance of holding public office such views were expressed as early as the time of ancient greece by aristotle according to french political scientist bernard manin the inegalitarian nature of elections stems from four factors the unequal treatment of candidates by voters the distinction of candidates required by choice the cognitive advantage conferred by salience and the costs of disseminating information these four factors result in the evaluation of candidates based on voters partial standards of quality and social saliency for example skin colour and good looks this leads to selfselection biases in candidate pools due to unobjective standards of treatment by voters and the costs barriers to entry associated with raising ones political profile ultimately the result is the election of candidates who are superior whether in actuality or as perceived within a cultural context and objectively unlike the voters they are supposed to represent evidence suggests that the concept of electing representatives was originally conceived to be different from democracy prior to the 18th century some societies in western europe used sortition as a means to select rulers a method which allowed regular citizens to exercise power in keeping with understandings of democracy at the time the idea of what constituted a legitimate government shifted in the 18th century to include consent especially with the rise of the enlightenment from this point onward sortition fell out of favor as a mechanism for selecting rulers on the other hand elections began to be seen as a way for the masses to express popular consent repeatedly resulting in the triumph of the electoral process until the present day this conceptual misunderstanding of elections as open and egalitarian when they are not innately so may thus be a root cause of the problems in contemporary governance those in favor of this view argue that the modern system of elections was never meant to give ordinary citizens the chance to exercise power merely privileging their right to consent to those who rule th",
