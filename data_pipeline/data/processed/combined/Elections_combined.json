    "nick fuentes and the failure of the right wing to be honest the reason why nick fuentes has broken into the mainstream with the vigor and momentum he has is because of the right wings failure to be honest to appeal to the youth and to govern the country the common denominator behind all three is the united states seemingly unconditional support for israel where support stays continuous despite israels aggression against iran qatar palestine to name a few not to mention the history between israel and america where they committed two false flag attacks that we know of with relative certainty lavon affair uss liberty the reason for this support is due to the influence aipac and other israeliaffiliated lobbies hold where around 80 of representatives and congressmen are endorsed and funded by aipac the political milieu of america used to be radically different before the 2010s where criticism towards israel was enough to label you an antisemite with continuous criticism resulting in cancellation this is what apparently happened to nick fuentes aided by ben shapiro with the dawn of the internet political discussion and debate became much more transparent due to anonymity trolling ragebaiting extremism became rampant but honest political debate was also an effect of anonymity not having to fear your identity being leaked led towards transparency between people and events with the election of obama in 2008 and 2012 it served as a catalyst for identity politics where the left began taking big steps further to the left towards progressivism while sacrificing economic egalitarianism just look at the graph by pewresearch where pro immigration skyrocketed in the democrat camp while the republicans largely stayed consistent the right wing was unable to do the same because the vilifcation of criticism towards israel proliferated into discouragement of nationalism white pride masculinity and other right wing ideals trumps rise and subsequent election caused the first fractures in these taboos resulting in virile patriotism and antiillegalimmigration sentiment his divisive character caused both sides to polarise even more however one thing was still airtight the inability to critique the relations between israel and america and the inability to critique what role american jews play in this during this time some popular figures within the right wing kept pandering towards the young male group attempting to encourage masculinity very few honestly cared about men and masculinity they generally only talked about it to get their votes figures like jordan peterson did genuinely care resulting in the man becoming very popular among young men with the introduction of tiktok reels and other shortform video formats information was able to be quickly disseminated from one party to millions of others whether the information was validreal or not is irrelevant only how entertaining it is thus the seeds of antisemitism was born fastforwarding to october 2023 hamas declared war on israel israel was seen as a defendant rightfully acting in self defense against hamas however the image did not last with each month more and more criticism grew regarding the way at which israel attacked gaza for example approximately 70 of palestinian casualties are women and children and obviously 100 of the men killed werent all terrorists more than half of the bakeries in gaza are destroyed most infrastructure is bombed into nonexistence etc etc the progressive left wing were the first to call the aggression out in the mainstream strongly criticising israel with the way they were handling the war this proliferated into instragram and tiktok resulting in youth becoming more and more aware of the existence of israel by the day critique and opposition towards israel became a mainstream position some right wing people took advantage of the fact and created short form videos exposing israels involvement in false flag operations allegations and suspicions regarding 911 and some made plain antisemitic content with hitlers speeches but ai translated etc etc these videos were entertaining resulting in the algorithm proliferating these videos all throughout instagramtiktok and now comes nick fuentes nick fuentes is an extremely entertaining young highly articulate and a gifted political commentator his language his actions made him funny and relatable his verbal intelligence made him articulate say what you will about him but he has also predicted several events war with iran being the most infamous one a former supporter of trump he started opposing him before the elections of 2024 he has made several insightful remarks making connections regarding palantir and the american government for example so now you have three ingredients critique towards israel and the relations between israel and america became acceptable the youth both left and right are feeling angry and resentful against americas continuous support of israel but also against their lack of an economic future and finally a disenfranchised male youth now you have a young streamer who doesnt care about being politically correct says whats on his mind is very entertaining and is also highly informative what could possibly happen platforming nick fuentes only accelerated the inevitable rise of fame at least now we know about who he actually is and what beliefs he holds thoughts tldr the right wing planted the seeds for their destruction by shutting down criticism and discussion about israeliamerican relations about their shared history and their future israels war catapulted the existence of israel into mainstream israels own actions made opposition towards the nation more and more popular facts like aipacs control over americas foreign policy was mixed with fiction jews poisoned the wells during the black death etc this combined with a disenfranchised male youth led towards them rallying around nick fuentes a young charismatic and gifted political streamercommentator",

    "brief challenging the 12th amendment this is a theoretical caseonly i am not a lawyer but would appreciate opinions and arguments from constitutional lawyers to improve the argument united states district court jurisdiction tbd memorandum of constitutional challenge petitioners the presidential candidate receiving the secondhighest number of electoral votes hereafter petitioner vice presidential candidate in their capacity as the constitutionally designated vice president and president of the senate et al respondent the united states government subject constitutional challenge to the twelfth and twentyfifth amendments filed date i introduction this brief petitions the court to review the constitutionality of the twelfth and twentyfifth amendments to the united states constitution on the grounds that both violate the separation of powers and distort the original intent of the framers by conflating the legislative and executive branches through the office of the vice president the petitioners contend that the vice president is by constitutional design a legislative officer not an executive subordinate by binding the vice presidency to the president through joint election and presidential appointment the twelfth and twentyfifth amendments effectively dissolved a structural safeguard essential to interbranch accountability1 the petitioner vice presidential candidate having been the presidential candidate receiving the secondhighest number of votes in the most recent presidential election asserts standing as the rightful occupant of the legislative office of vice president under the unamended constitutional framework and in this capacity as the presiding officer of the senate2 definition of terms for purposes of this petition the term vice presidentelect shall denote the individual constitutionally designated to serve as president of the senate under article i section 3 historically this office was occupied by the candidate receiving the secondhighest electoral vote for president and not by appointment or association with the executive branch this designation reflects the framers original mechanism for maintaining legislative independence within the federal structure the title vice president is retained solely for textual consistency with the constitution however in all references herein the role shall be understood as a legislative officerthe presiding authority of the senateand not as an executive subordinate ii background under the unamended constitution the vice president was the presidential candidate who received the secondhighest number of votes3 this design was deliberate ensuring that the executive and legislative presidencies embodied opposing perspectives thus institutionalizing dissent and protecting against factional consolidation of power the twelfth amendment 1804 replaced this system with a joint ticket forcing partisan unity between the president and vice president4 the twentyfifth amendment 1967 compounded this dependency by granting the sitting president the power to nominate a vice president subject to congressional confirmation5 together these changes subordinated a legislative office to executive authority eroding the separation of powers and silencing institutional opposition6 iii standing of the plaintiff the petitioner vice presidential candidate asserts standing as the de facto vice president under the original constitutional framework which would designate the runnerup presidential candidate as such by virtue of receiving the secondhighest electoral total2 this claim arises from structural injury the office constitutionally belonging to the runnerup presidential candidate no longer exists in its intended independent form this constitutes an ongoing injury to the legislative process and to the constitutional balance between branches this satisfies the standing requirements of injuryinfact causation and redressability under lujan v defenders of wildlife 504 us 555 19927 iv argument a the vice president as a legislative officer independent of executive authority the constitution grants the vice president no enumerated executive powers the offices sole constitutional dutiespresiding over the senate and casting a tiebreaking voteare explicitly legislative article i section 3 clause 43 consequently the president holds no constitutional authority to direct dismiss or otherwise control the vice president the vice president serves not as a deputy to the president but as an officer of congress8 by tethering the vice presidents election to that of the president the twelfth amendment subordinates the legislative presiding officer to executive interests the twentyfifth amendment further entrenches this subordination by allowing the president to nominate the vice president converting a legislative officer into a presidential appointee4 these arrangements constitute a structural violation of the separation of powers an executive head now selects or depends upon a legislative officer contrary to the design articulated by the framers6 b the twelfth amendments misapprehension of constitutional design the twelfth amendment arose in response to early electoral crises particularly the election of 1800 but its enactment reflected a fundamental misinterpretation of constitutional purpose4 the framers did not intend for the president and vice president to agree politically they intended the vice presidents independence to serve as a check within government ensuring that ambition would indeed counteract ambition federalist no 51 madison 178811 by merging the vice presidency into a single partisan ticket the twelfth amendment dismantled the original balance it presumed harmony where the constitution required frictionmistaking necessary opposition for dysfunction c the twentyfifth amendments compounding violation the twentyfifth amendment further entrenches executive dominance over the legislature5 by empowering the president to nominate a vice president it converts the senates presiding officer into a political appointee this erodes legislative independence violating the principle that no branch shall appoint the leadership of another6 d the vice presidents legislative nature the presidents lack of authority and the incompatibility of executive subordination article ii confers upon the president the executive power while article i defines the vice presidents functions exclusively within the senate3 there exists no textual authority empowering the president to assign compel or regulate the vice presidents actions any executive function performed by the vice president derives solely from political custom not constitutional mandate thus the president possesses no lawful authority over the vice president and the twelfth and twentyfifth amendments violate the separationofpowers principle by subordinating a legislative officer to the executive9 this subordination implicates not merely the office of the vice president but the entirety of congress article i section 6the incompatibility clauseprohibits any person holding any office under the united states from simultaneously serving as a member of either house the clauses spirit is to prevent any branch from exercising influence over another by blending personnel or allegiance when the senates presiding officer is made answerable to the president the legislative body is no longer autonomous its sessions procedures and even tiebreaking votes fall under the shadow of executive preference though senators themselves remain independent in election their presiding officerthe one who conducts debate recognizes speakers and governs procedural orderis institutionally beholden to an external branch this is not mere coincidence of political alignment it is structural damage by converting the president of the senate into an executive adjunct the amendments effectively place the senate under partial executive supervision compelling congress into a standing violation of the incompatibility clauses principle of independence the constitution forbids executive occupation of legislative offices not to prevent friendship or alliance but to prevent control thus the defect introduced by the twelfth and twentyfifth amendments extends beyond the individual office it renders congress as an institution constitutionally compromisedits presiding officer transformed into a conduit for executive influence rather than a guardian of legislative order e historical intent and institutional integrity hamilton in federalist no 67 described the vice presidency as an appendage of the senate emphasizing its legislative core14 madison in federalist no 51 warned against the concentration of power that might arise when any branch ceases to be independent11 the twelfth and twentyfifth amendments erased this friction they transformed a system of structural balance into a system of executive hierarchy allowing the executive to dominate both its own administration and the senates upper chamber6 v relief sought petitioners respectfully request that this court recognize that the vice president is a legislative officer independent of the executive branch declare that the twelfth and twentyfifth amendments violate the constitutional doctrine of separation of powers insofar as they bind the vice presidency to executive selection or influence declare that the vice presidency under the original constitutional design rightfully belongs to the candidate receiving the secondhighest number of electoral votes and refer this matter to congress for corrective constitutional action consistent with the original intent of the framers vi conclusion the twelfth and twentyfifth amendments though ratified procedurally introduced a substantive contradiction into the constitutional structure by merging the legislative vice presidency with the executive branch they nullified the separation of powers that underpins american governance the framers designed the vice president to act as a legislative counterbalance to the president not as a subordinate within the executive to restore constitutional integrity the court must affirm that the vice president is a legislative officer independent of executive authority and that any constitutional provision subordinating that office to

    "there are better alternatives to the 22nd amdt the 22nd amendment stipulates that no person shall be elected to the office of the president more than twice its proponents argue that term limits are an inherent necessity of democracy and of preventing the presidency from devolving into a dictatorship but i personally dont see the causal connection between the absence of term limits and authoritarian rule just because there appears a usual correlation between the absence of term limits and authoritarian oneparty regimes throughout the world the term limit on presidency is not a practical exercise of checks and balances on the sitting president and on the extent of the offices powers its merely a timeout on how many times a person is allowed to take office the irony is that it is in itself undemocratic it arbitrarily forbids the people from reelecting a popular leader who has committed no crime engaged in no proven act of corruption to prove him unsuited for office depriving the nation from years of his competent and qualified administration while still alive and able it puts an arbitrary unwarranted restriction on the peoples right to be governed by their consented candidate for national leadership for the duration that they so desire this arbitrary legal stipulation has barred a great many wellreceived presidents throughout the us history from reelection while paving the way for lesser suited candidates if the idea was to prevent any potential overreach or autocratic tendencies from the executive branch there were other much more optimal alternatives as constitutional measures to keep the office of presidency within democratic bounds such as 1 forbid a president to serve three consecutive terms instead require a former president to wait out a successors term or more terms etc before he can run for office again this way he wont be allowed to occupy the office indefinitely without intervals but also wont be barred from it forever at the expense of possible democratic demands for his return in the future 2 instead of focusing on the duration of presidency focus on actually keeping the office itself limited in range and ability while the sitting president uses its powers 2a prevent the president from nominating or appointing supreme court justices leave it solely to congress why is he allowed at all to control the branch which is supposed to keep him in check 2b remove the presidential power of veto have congress power of legislation superior to presidential orders and remove the requirement of his assent to laws if a bill is passed by the two houses of congress it should be final 2c make it legally easier for congress to quickly impeach and replace a rogue administration which refuses to abide by scotus decisions dont leave the countrys fate to four years of damage by an incompetent leader just because he won the popular elections this is not an elective monarchy",

retaking the white house as the republicans had the presidency for 16 out of the past 20 years they just need to find a person who can lead them top victory once again the peoples liberal party there are two top issues right now first is foreign policy the empire of japan faces even more infighting protests only increased and more often the protesters answer the police actions against them in violence as the nijubashi square massacre is fresh in peoples minds people are not letting go and want change the problem is also that the protests or as they should be called uprisings as they really are takes place in puppet states in former russian territories china and korea and of course the military has difficulty putting them down as they concentrate on iran the situation there is just becoming harder as iranian forces continue their guerrilla warfare pressure is continuously put on prime minister inoki to introduce reforms to increase democratization however he may fear that the military will turn on him for that so he stays firm for now the second top issue is the new supreme court justice appointment after justice frank minis johnson died of pneumonia in july president powell appointed hillary miller as his replacement although miller is experienced attorney especially in rhode island and seen as really moderate some thing that this appointment is somewhat shaky as she is the wife of powells attorney general ben miller hillary millers confirmation hearings take place right now and there is no way of knowing how would it go however this can be a controversial issue in the primaries so far and candidates would need to discuss if they support the appointment or not when it comes to the actual primaries all 6 candidates are official faction nominees the faction primaries limited the competition and the mud wrestling once again as many pledged to not attack their opponents on person issues the candidates respresent their factions but they need to decide the one who will represent the party and maybe america as a whole so who are the candidate harrison ford official nelsonian coalitions candidate former governor of illinois former actor leader of the faction socially moderately progressive profree market supports technoliberalism moderately interventionist inventor of fordism just go for ford although the nelsonian coalition had its first faction primary the coalition could have just chosen harrison ford as the candidate regardless he dominated the contest with 5869 of the votes one of the first wins in the faction primaries with the majority of votes it seems that people really liked ford as his charisma of an actor and experience as mayor governor was booming combination now he takes them into the general primaries and it may truly be nelsonian coalitions best shot at winning the nomination former governor ford comes to this race with a lot of momentum and he may just need to retain it albert gore jr official third way coalitions candidate senator from tennessee former governor and representative previous faction candidate leader of the faction son of former vice president socially moderate fiscally responsible interventionist environmentalist new leadership for the new millennium albert gore jr is the other person who won his factions primary with the majority of votes as he got 5057 the winner of the previous contest gore is the only person so far to win a faction primary twice maybe its a preview of whats to come senator gore has a lot of momentum leading into the party primaries and he uses it to portray himself as someone who can effectively succeed powell even if hes from the different party although this will certainly attract independent voters its unknown how this strategy will work in his own partys primary however the peoples liberal party may just choose the most electable candidate and gore could make an argument that he is that candidate besides gore can sway progressives and green voters with hes environmental record wesley clark official national progressive caucus candidate general socially moderately progressive economically moderately progressive interventionist for a safer fairer world wesley clark is an unusual candidate for the peoples liberal party a general who doesnt have a lot of experience on the domestic issues clark won the national progressive caucus primary with 415 surprisingly dominant victory as the faction lost a lot of influence maybe people though that going with powells formula of success was the right move no matter what general clark needs to make his case to the party as a whole if he wants to be taken seriously maybe he can show more of his domestic agenda or maybe he can double down on his foreign policy views its clarks choice and its up to his campaign if he wins marcy kaptur official commonwealth coalitions candidate the governor of ohio former representative economically progressive supports innovation socially moderate moderately dovish people land and livelihood marcy kaptur was close contender for the running mate position 4 years ago now he is not just a contender but her factions candidate winning tough commonwealth coalitions primary with just 2325 of the votes kaptur now needs to position her case to be not only her partys nominee but the successor of laughlins legacy governor of ohio could do well in iowa known for its middle class reputation she could bank it on the success in iowa or she could run more national campaign kapturs grassroot appeal could bear its fruit if she does everything right could governor kaptur be the first woman president only time will tell ted turner official rainbow leagues candidate business magnate and philanthropis from georgia socially progressive economically progressive dovish idealist environmentalist agnostic peace planet people the faction known for its activism selects once the richest man on earth as its candidate this shouldnt be right but it is ted turner won the rainbow leagues faction primary over former president nominee in a close race with turner not even receiving plurality of the votes as the first choice this billionaire from georgia now needs to prove to the party that he didnt just pay for the candidacy but that his policies paid off turner can try to sell the progressive economic policy to some of the more sceptical businessminded voters or he can try to show off his environmental policy or he can come out as the biggest dove in the race turners advantage is that hes a clean slate when it comes to politics but it can also be his downfall as with one clear mistake he cant fall on his past work in politics as he doesnt have any turner needs to play his cards perfectly walter cronkite official rational liberal caucus candidate former journalist turned civic advocate socially moderate economically progressive moderately dovish super old voice of america voice for americans with walter cronkites lax campaign many thought that his run for president was just to see if he could and well he won rational liberal caucus primary although barely cronkite got just 2264 of the votes just enough to avoid a runoff now cronkite should evaluate his situation and choose how he should act as he doesnt have a lot of momentum the voice of america has the goodwill of the people but it doesnt always mean that they will vote for you maybe he needs to campaign more maybe he should broaden his campaign organization or maybe he can leave everything how it is walter cronkite needs to choose quickly as he cant really waste any time if he wants to actually become president thats it",
    "recontructed america the 2000 rnc preview the first faction primaries for the ruling party ended but the primaries for the republican presidential nomination are just starting the first contest iowa caucus is not that long away and if some mistakes are made factions would have little time to adjust but there is a room to adjust the republican party need to figure out who will lead the party after president powell and who is the best person keep the republican rule the odds are not that much in favor of them as they didnt win 3 straight presidential elections since 1932 but maybe just maybe they could defy the odds the republican party there are two top issues right now first is foreign policy the empire of japan faces even more infighting protests only increased and more often the protesters answer the police actions against them in violence as the nijubashi square massacre is fresh in peoples minds people are not letting go and want change the problem is also that the protests or as they should be called uprisings as they really are takes place in puppet states in former russian territories china and korea and of course the military has difficulty putting them down as they

johnson died of pneumonia in july president powell appointed hillary miller as his replacement although miller is experienced attorney especially in rhode island and seen as really moderate some thing that this appointment is somewhat shaky as she is the wife of powells attorney general ben miller hillary millers confirmation hearings take place right now and there is no way of knowing how would it go however this can be a controversial issue in the primaries so far when it comes to the actual primaries 5 candidates are official faction nominees and 1 is the special nominee of the crownlings allies of biden the faction primaries limited the competition and seems to limit the mud wrestling the candidates respresent their factions but they need to decide the one who will represent the party and maybe america as a whole so who are the candidate john mccain official national union caucus candidate senator from arizona former representative and pow maverick socially moderate economically moderately conservative moderately interventionist man of integrity persistence prosperity peace john mccain was a clear favorite to win the national union caucus faction primary and win he did he won the primary with 3773 of the votes far better than any of his opponents it seems like the strategy of promising to continue colin powells policies worked and so he continues with this message senator mccain is once again actively campaigning on powells legacy and his own resume maybe americans just want everything to stay the same and for someone to not rock the boat mark roosevelt official american solidarity candidate senator from massachusetts socially progressive economically moderate internationalist reformer really young greatgrandson and grandnephew of former presidents todays change is the return to better times to say that mark roosevelt wasnt expected to win his factions primary is to say nothing however him winning by such a big margin is even more surprising as he won 3703 of the votes with that being said maybe the country want the resturn of roosevelts in charge after all the last person who gave republicans 3 consecutive presidential wins was his granduncle and it seems that the promise of change and the return of roosevelt republicanism worked for senator roosevelt in the faction primary so it may work now this young roosevelt could put his name in history if he continues his energetic campaigning bill oreilly official national conservative caucus candidate political commentator and author socially conservative economically moderate populist moderately interventionist fck it well do it live guy well do it now on one hand bill oreilly winning his factions primary wasnt expected on the other hand we are talking about the faction that made its name by doing things its way so national conservative caucus choosing the charismatic outsider as their candidate with 3523 of the votes is natural as for oreilly himself he didnt expect to win but hes embracing this opportunity who knows maybe his populist slogans and social conservatism is what the party needs after powell nancy landon official american dry leagues candidate senator from kansas socially moderate fiscally responsible internationalist moderate prohibitionist dry way cleaner america senator nancy landon winning the american dry leagues primary was maybea much needed choice as a way for the faction something beyond just prohibitionist platform she won with 3085 of the votes and now looks to try to become not only the first prohibitionist president in a long time but also the first female president she could really play on her moderate views on other issues to come across as the most respectable choice although not as loud as many others in the race maybe being relatively quite would make her heard to more people vern ehlers official libertarian leagues candidate vice president former representative from michigan economically libertarian socially moderate interventionist scientist environmentalist smarter smaller stronger america vern ehlers seems to be the natural successor of president colin powell as he is his vice president so it was a little odd that he barely won his factions primary and he didnt have the most 1st choice votes in the primary eaither however his primary was conducted under rankedchoice voting and so it wouldnt be fair to say that the other candidates wouldnt have the same issues still vice president ehlers is here and hes ready to go he promises to continue powells policies while decreasing the government to moderate voters who are sceptical he can point to his environmentalist record which was a key part of the electorate that cost wellstone the election could vern ehlers sway green voters to the republican side only time will tell george w bush senator from texas former representative grandson of former presidential nominee son of the speaker of the house from national union caucus crownling economically conservative socially moderately moderately interventionist he gets 2 additional points in the polls due to the competition contest result embrace the success and now we come to former president joseph r biden favorite candidate george w bush surname bush has its own presidential legacy prescott bush was presidential nominee in 1956 george h w bush was one of the most influencial speakers of the house in history and also was a presidential candidate and now their heir has come to finally succeed senator bush comes into the race with the backing of not only his father but also joseph r biden and his crownling which include former vice president and presidential nominee reubin askew bush thinks that changing the way the party chose its nominee would only lead to the party losing success former president biden agreed and this along with biden liking bushs views more than other candidates led to biden endorsing bush now w needs to make the case that he is the heir to not only powell but bidens success his brend compassionate conservatism may attract conservative voters while his moderation on foreign policy could sway those who are cautious about the situation on the international stage the main question is will this work will w do what his father and grandfather couldnt only one way to decide thats it",

    "the evangelical persecution complex the above is a video of a prominent evangelical content creator named alisa childers in my opinion she is one of the most dangerous and vocal purveyors of the syncretistic relationship between maga and evangelical christianity childers explains that we live in a negative world in which society at large hates god and hates christianity as a result of this hostility christians need to be hostile in return we need to be more vocal about our support for maga policies more exclusive in who we associate with and who we ostracize and more hostile toward the world at large in other words according to childers because evangelicals are hated and persecuted we need to lean more into abrasive culture war rhetoric conservative ideology and hostility to our enemies this view is nothing new throughout my formative years in evangelicalism and beyond i constantly heard that the world hated us and we needed to respond with bold and abrasive truth telling to counter this threat this evangelical persecution complex epc existed long before trump and will contribute to evangelicals inevitably supporting the next rightwing authoritarian autocrat that comes along after trump is gone lets examine why this view is so toxic and antijesus first it reflects a deep double standard held by evangelicals concerning public religion evangelicals love warrelated language and metaphors concerning their relationship to culture often in conservative churches you will hear things like we need to take the culture back for jesus as if the culture is a strategic position on a battlefield this is why you see organizations like lifewise academy trying to infiltrate public schools and bills forcing public school classrooms to display the 10 commandments notice its never the beatitudes telling people the meek will inherit the earth makes for bad culture warriors now i want you to close your eyes and imagine muslims or atheists doing this imagine muslims bussing kids in and out of public schools to learn about the five pillars the recent conservative freakout over zohran mamdanis election win should tell you all the need to know about how they feel about muslims getting power imagine atheists passing a bill forcing classrooms display nietzsches declaration that god is dead evangelicals would oppose this with every lever of power available to them and see it as evidence of a hostile culture that hates god if we implement a hostile takeover of culture thats good but if they do the exact same thing thats bad as the maga movement consolidates power so do evangelicals when that power is challenged evangelicals will bristle and claim persecution and claim their religious freedom is questioned but evangelicals dont want religious freedom they want religious privilege language of religious freedom becomes a trojan horse in which the desire for cultural power and influence is smuggled into the discussion sadly the problem goes way beyond political double standards the epc undermines and opposes the way of jesus itself at its heart its a deal with the devil well talk about that in part 2",

    "idl when americans use demographics and population size as an excuse to why the united states cant improve its almost inevitable whether you point out another country doing better than the united states or even just give another country props youll have so many americans particularly right wingers that will always say thats because they have a small population and they are homogeneous i saw a post asking why the united states doesnt have the nordic model and it was flooded by americans saying because norway has a small population and no black people its wrong on so many levels because its racist weird for a country that prides itself on being so anti racist and a form of american exceptionalism romania lithuania haiti bhutan latvia albania cambodia etc are all homogenous countries with small populations none of these countries are as developed as norway or sweden brazil is a huge country and its very diverse and they are more developed than haiti which is much smaller and much less diverse by these peoples logic haiti should be doing a lot better than brazil but thats not the case then for romania lithuania latvia and albania theyll say well but they were under communism hmm so its almost like a countrys success has nothing to do with its demographics and everything to do on how their economy is structured and the polices they put in place americans always say we cant have universal healthcare because our population is too big and diverse well im gonna use brazil as an example again brazil has 212 million people and is diverse arguably more diverse than the united states and they have universal healthcare not only does brazil have universal healthcare but they also have free college and free dental care even the nordic countries dont have free dental care for everybody so if brazil can have universal healthcare free college and free dental care and they have a big diverse population then whats the united states excuse now some people will say yeah but brazil isnt as developed as the united states but that proves my point even more a country with a big diverse population less developed than the united states and even pays less taxes has all these things why cant we ive also asked in a brazilian sub if they like their healthcare and the overwhelming majority of the brazilians said yes the population size argument also makes no sense because japan has a large population and so does indonesia and they also have universal healthcare heck india and china have a form of universal healthcare and they are bigger than the united states the real reason why the united states doesnt have the nordic model is because the united states is a hyper individualistic country a lot of americans hate government being involved in anything a lot has also been brainwashed to think universal healthcare and strong labor rights are communism plus a lot of americans have bought into the propaganda of health insurance companies that universal healthcare is bad lastly we essentially have legalized bribery through lobbying which is highly illegal in the nordic countries so essentially our politicians are representing their corporate donors and not the people but i guess all of this is too nuanced for some americans to understand and its just easier to blame the people of color on why we cant have nice things lets break this down even further because theres so many angles this argument makes no sense how can diversity be the blame when the only people opposing these policies are white american white americans vote republican and no democrat in the presidential election has won the white vote since the 1960s if the united states was less diverse than the united states would be even more right wing so how can you say the diversity is to blame i dont like this argument because its extremely vacuous whether a country is successful or not is due to their economic structure institutions leadership etc but simple minded people will say muh well they arent diverse so that must be the reason arent i so smart as if being the same race means youll automatically think alike lol then they completely ignore the urban and rural divide still exists even in very homogeneous countries",

    "free and fair elections eci pil court jurisdiction legal reasoning new question 2025 the supreme court recently dismissed a public interest litigation pil filed by advocate rohit pandey seeking the constitution of a special investigation team sit to probe alleged voter list manipulation in the bengaluru central constituency during the 2024 lok sabha elections the petitioner relied on allegations made by the leader of opposition claiming over 40000 invalid and duplicate voters were included violating the principle of one person one vote the petitioner argued that such anomalies violate articles 325 and 326 which mandate equality of franchise and direct elections based on adult suffrage and undermine article 324 which vests in the election commission eci the duty to ensure free and fair elections the petitioner also invoked articles 14 and 21 asserting that voter list tampering deprives citizens of equality before law and meaningful participation in democratic governance the petitioner cited mohinder singh gill v cec where the court held that the essence of democracy lies in the free exercise of choice by each individual voter and kuldip nayar v union of india which emphasised that elections must not be perverted by discretion or muscle power however the supreme court bench of justices surya kant and joymalya bagchi dismissed the pil observing that the petitioner should pursue remedies before the election commission of india eci and may escalate only upon ecis failure to grant remedies where available the bench held that unless there is an ex facie constitutional violation or manifest breach of fundamental rights judicial intervention in the electoral process must remain limited the court reiterated that the eci as a constitutional authority under article 324 is empowered to address electoral irregularities and the judicial process should not displace this mechanism except in cases of clear constitutional failure questions 1 which of the following best explains why the supreme court declined to entertain the pil a because the court found the allegations of voter duplication false b because judicial intervention is barred in all electoral matters c because the petitioner had not exhausted the available remedies before the election commission d because voter rolls are not part of the constitutional scheme 2 if the allegations of largescale duplication in voter rolls were proven which constitutional principle would most directly be violated a federalism since elections are conducted by the states b separation of powers since courts cannot supervise elections c equality of franchise forming part of the principle of free and fair elections d judicial independence since the matter involves electoral rolls 3 suppose the election commission fails to investigate the alleged manipulation despite multiple complaints according to the reasoning in the passage which of the following remedies would then become constitutionally tenable a filing a fresh pil alleging the ecis dereliction of its constitutional duty under article 324 b directly approaching the president under article 72 c requesting parliament to legislate on electoral rolls d filing an rti application seeking information on voter duplication 4 premise 1 the principle of free and fair elections forms part of the basic structure of the constitution premise 2 manipulation of voter lists undermines free and fair elections which conclusion logically follows a manipulation of voter lists violates the basic structure of the constitution b manipulation of voter lists is a statutory irregularity but not unconstitutional c manipulation of voter lists can be ignored during elections d manipulation of voter lists strengthens democracy 5 the supreme court in dismissing the pil emphasized that judicial review in electoral matters must be exercised sparingly and only in cases of clear constitutional failure which of the following statements most accurately captures the constitutional reasoning behind this restraint a because judicial review itself is not part of the basic structure and must yield to institutional autonomy b because article 324 vests primary responsibility for ensuring free and fair elections in the election commission and judicial intervention should not preempt that constitutional function c because article 191a already guarantees political participation making judicial scrutiny unnecessary d because the existence of alternate remedies automatically ousts constitutional jurisdiction",

    "the true israel of god part 3 and he said to me you are my servant israel in whom i will show my glory isaiah 493 if there was ever any doubt exactly who is this israel that god is referring to in this text a closer examination of the passage should make it abundantly clear listen to me o islands and pay attention you peoples from afar the lord called me from the womb from the body of my mother he named me and he has made my mouth like a sharp sword in the shadow of his hand he has concealed me and he has also made me a select arrow he has hidden me in his quiver and he said to me you are my servant israel in whom i will show my glory isaiah 49 13 this remarkable passage is clearly speaking of the messiah who was to come as such it was referring to none other than the lord jesus christ that this is evident can be seen by reading the entirety of the chapter but a passage from the book of revelation makes it abundantly clear who this illustrious person that is spoken of is and in his hand he held seven stars and out of his mouth came a sharp twoedged sword rev 1 16 that this is the messiah the lord christ is beyond dispute as the 18th verse of that same chapter in revelation clearly reveals what isaiahs passage therefore is telling us is nothing short of astounding it is the illustrious person here spoken of who would epitomize in his own person all that god intended that israel should ever be he would truly be jehovahs servant whereas israel after the flesh had miserably failed and turned to the baals and other false gods of their day and served them this one would faithfully serve him and in so doing would raise up the tribes of jacob and restore the preserved ones of israel verse 6 he would also be a light to the gentiles verse 6 this one was truly my servant whom i uphold my chosen one in whom my soul delights i have put my spirit upon him he will bring forth justice to the gentiles isaiah 42 1 he would be the very incarnation of israel the substance the essence of what israel should be in the divine purpose all this is in sharp contrast to the carnal degenerate seed mentioned in the previous chapter hear this o house of jacob who are named israel and who came forth from the loins of judah who swear by the name of the lord and invoke the god of israel but not in truth nor in righteousness for they call themselves after the holy city and lean on the god if israel the lord of hosts is his nameyou have heard look at all this and you will you not declare it i proclaim to you new things from this time even hidden things which you have not known they are created now and not long ago and before today you have not heard them lest you should say behold i knew them you have not heard you have not known even from long ago your ear has not been open because i knew that you would deal very treacherously and you have been called a rebel from birth isaiah 48 12 68 fleshly carnal israel was just that it was israel in name only not in truth or reality it lacked any of the essential qualities that were required in the servant of jehovah instead it was a rebel from its birth its very inception beneath the mountain called sinai had proven its degeneracy there it had prostituted itself and fallen down before a golden calf and cast off the yoke of servitude to indulge in its own desires thus god would do a new thing something which would remain hidden until the time of its accomplishment he would make a new israel a new servant one that would not fail him or rebel against him this is the mystery the hidden thing that jehovah would do the same hidden mystery that paul has set forth in his letter to the ephesians this chosen one of jehovah the epitome of the true servant in his own right would not be alone he would draw a multitude of redeemed sinners to himself and they would constitute a mystical body the body of christ which would partake of the same essential qualities as their glorious head collectively they would become the servant of jehovah the new israel of god the new creation for we are his workmanship created in christ jesus eph 2 10 for neither is circumcision anything nor uncircumcision but a new creation and to those who will walk by this rule peace and mercy be upon them and upon the israel of god gal 6 1516 what a glorious mystery what a marvelous plan who cannot but stand in awe and wonder and fall down before the infinite wisdom of the most high as he works out his purpose in the earth a company of redeemed sinners saved by grace given a new nature whose hearts have been made pure through faith acts 15 9 this is the israel of god these are the ones who will see god matt 5 8 these are the ones to whom god is surely good psalm 731 this is the nation that was brought forth all at once isaiah 66 8 as the psalmist prophesied the lord hath said unto me thou art my son this day have i begotten thee psalm 2 7 this prophecy was made good at the resurrection of christ from the dead as paul states in acts and we preach to you the good news of the promise made to the fathers that god has fulfilled this promise to our children in that he raised up jesus as it is written in the second psalm thou art my son this day have i begotten thee acts 13 3233 on that day christ jesus the servant of jehovah the true israel of god was brought forth and in the process all of his people with him the true israel of god was brought forth in one day the day of his triumphant resurrection and victory over sin death and satan hallelujah remarkably in spite of all the clear evidence to the contrary there are some who continue to hold to the fallacious notion that israel after the flesh somehow has a date with destiny it is only a matter of time until it resumes its rightful place among the nations they brazenly utter veiled warnings that those who propagate what they contemptuously refer to as replacement theology are perilously close to becoming the recipients of the divine curse for speaking against israel in such a manner as the scripture clearly has warned gen 123 and i will bless them that bless thee and curse him that curseth thee and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed with this one passage they attempt to silence or intimidate all who would oppose their misguided notions concerning israel after the flesh but a simple look at the scriptures should quickly dispel this fallacious opinion in the gospel of mark we have an incident recorded in which the lord jesus and his disciples are journeying on the way to jerusalem and on the next day when they had departed from bethany he became hungry and seeing at a distance a fig tree in leaf he went to see if perhaps he would find anything on it and when he came to it he found nothing but leaves for it was not the season for figs and jesus answered and said to it may no one ever eat fruit from you again and his disciples were listening and whenever evening came they would go out of the city and as they were passing by in the morning they saw the fig tree withered from the roots up and being reminded peter said to him rabbi behold the fig tree which you cursed has withered mark 11 1214 1921 notice carefully what happened here the lord christ cursed the barren fig tree even the dispensationalists are forced to admit that the fig tree is oftentimes although not always an emblem of the nation of israel indeed their entire system of eschatology hinges on what they refer to as a putting forth of the leaves of the fig tree which they erroneously relate to israel being regathered into their ancient land in 1948 ad suffice it to say that unless they are going to be deliberately disingenuous they must admit the consistent use of the symbol as referring to the nation of israel what happened here is obvious to all but the most prejudiced or biased reader christ jesus cursed the nation for its barrenness one simply cannot escape the force of this if this is not enough to convince the doubter then a look at another passage should serve to enforce this assertion lukes gospel this time records the incident and he began telling this parable a certain man had a fig tree which had been planted in his vineyard and he came looking for fruit on it and did not find any and he said to the vineyardkeeper behold for three years i have come looking for fruit on this fig tree without finding any cut it down why does it even use up the ground and he answered and said to him let it alone sir for this year too until i dig around it and put in fertilizer and if it bears fruit next year fine but if not cut it down luke 13 69 this parable bears such a striking resemblance to the actual event that took place in marks gospel that it could not be merely coincidental the same truth is being set forth in both incidents that are recorded one by example the other by parable that the nation of israel after the flesh is being referred to is easily discerned if one simply considers that the entire length of the lord jesus earthly ministry up to this point was three years for three years he had gone about doing good and healing those who were sick and oppressed by the devil he had preached the gospel and brought light to the nation in spite of this by far and large he was despised and rejected of men and esteemed not israel as a whole refused his yoke and went about seeking a righteousness of their own by the law in the words of john the baptist the axe had been laid at their root of their tree and the tree that did not bear fruit would be cut down and cast into the fire yet the longsuffering of god was still not through with them there would be six more months another half year while the lord jesus would continue his gracious presence among them they would still be given time to avail themselves of the lifegiving words that would fall from his mouth and refresh the parched soil of their barren wilderness alas the scriptures record all too well that the fertilizer and the period of respite had no effect the nation gave over their benefactor to the romans and crucified him the time of reckoning would now have to come as the chief vineyard owner came to survey his vineyard this concept of israel being barren was no novelty their entire history bore witness to the truth of their fruitlessness isaiah the prophet long ago had predicated their ruin for the same reason and now o inhabitants of jerusalem and men of judah judge between me and my vineyard what more was there to do for my vineyard that i have not done in it why when i expected it to produce good grapes did it produce worthless ones so now let me tell you what i am going to do to my vineyard i will remove its hedge and it will be consumed i will break down its wall and it will become trampled ground and i will lay it waste it will not be pruned or hoed but briars and thorns will come up i will also charge the clouds to rain no rain on it for the vineyard of the lord of hosts is the house of israel and the men of judah his delightful plant thus he looked for justice but behold bloodshed for righteousness but behold a cry of distress isaiah 5 37 this prophecy had a partial fulfillment in the destruction of israel under the babylonian armies of nebuchadnezzar its complete fulfillment was yet to occur in 70 ad under the roman general titus and his legions as a matter of fact this exact passage is quoted by christ to the pharisees in both matthews and lukes gospel luke chapter 20 records that the pharisees understand that jesus had spoken this parable against the generation that was alive at the time of christs earthly ministry verse 19 matthew chapter 21 goes on to further elucidate the parable by recording that the pharisees actually pronounced the sentence of doom upon their own heads verse 41 upon this follows one of the clearest sayings in the word of god as concerns the nation of israel therefore i say to you the kingdom of god will be taken away from you and be given to a nation producing the fruit of it matt 21 43 the axe had been laid at the root of the tree the fertilizer had been applied time had been granted to see if the tree would yield its lookedfor fruit it had not nothing remained but for its rotting carcass matt 2428 to be the gathering place of the roman legions under titus who in 70 ad swept it from the scene with the broom of destruction from that point on the only nation that god would deal with in a salvific manner would be his holy nation the church comprised of men and women from every nation every tribe every tongue under heaven 1 peter 2 9 the point in all this is quite simple yet very succinct the lord jesus cursed the nation of israel there simply is no arguing this point it is indisputable the reason they were barren yet according to the dispensationalists view of the genesis promise made to abraham he had committed an unpardonable sin he had the audacity to curse the chosen people of god if you believe the dispensationalists then the lord jesus had now become cursed mind you this has nothing to do with him become a curse for us as galatians relates when he became the recipient of the divine curse as a propitiation to the wrath of god and the fulfiller of the law that was vicarious and was befitting of the lamb of god who though completely innocent in his own person freely chose to bear the curse for his own people no if we are to believe the dispensationalists then the lord jesus actually deserved or merited this curse since he had violated the divine injunction concerning the nation of israel one can easily see the folly in this scheme when viewed from this perspective for if it were true then we have the blasphemous suggestion that the lord jesus is pitted against his own father and is going around cursing that which his father has blessed if god would not allow balaam to curse that which he had blessed numbers 238 then why would he allow his son to do so the scriptures emphatically state that the curse causeless shall not come if there is not cause then the curse returns empty the fact is israel was indeed guilty and deserved the divine curse deuteronomy chapter 28 wherein lie the blessings and curses of the covenant makes it readily apparent that if they rebelled against god and cast off his authority they would indeed become subjected to his curse their rejection of the many prophetic voices send by god to warn them of their apostasy and their continued idolatry was due directly to the erroneous and fatal error of foolishly believing that god would not make good on his threatenings and smite them with the curse the last recorded voice in the old covenant period warns them once again to beware of this terrible delusion behold i am going to send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and terrible day of the lord and he will come and restore the hearts of the fathers to their children and the hearts of the children to their fathers lest i come and smite the land with a curse malachi 4 56 indeed jesus himself states that john the baptist was elijah as he came in the spirit and power of that great prophet of fire he did come and prepared the way for the messiah who was then rejected by those to whom he was sent with the result that they were to fill up them the measure of the guilt of your fathers matt 23 32 the very language of the lord jesus makes it perfectly clear that he is speaking of finality or totality once the measure has been filled it is full nothing more can be added to it all that remains is for the curse to be executed the apostle paul echoes these words in his first letter to the thessalonians for you brethren became imitators of the churches of god in christ jesus that are in judea for you also endured the same sufferings at the hands of your own countrymen even as they did from the jews who both killed the lord jesus and the prophets and drove us out they are not pleasing to god but hostile to all men hindering us from speaking to the gentiles that they might be saved with the result that they always fill up the measure of their sins but wrath has come upon them to the utmost 1thes 2 1416 in light of the above it is an abstruse view of the scriptures that would somehow exempt israel from the divine curse the curse could come down upon them at any time should they violate the covenant and history itself records that indeed they were not spared why then do dispensationalists continue to cling to their misguided notion that somehow israel after the flesh must be blessed by god and anathematize anyone who would dare call their view into question the answer is quite simple it is their stubborn insistence in reading the old testament forward into the new instead of viceversa the new testament clearly and unequivocally teaches us that only in christ jesus is there any blessing to be found simply read the first chapter of the letter to the ephesians to see paul enumerate the blessings that are to be found in christ and in him alone outside of christ lies the curse of gods broken law gal 310 anyone found outside of christ on the day of the great assize will suffer the full brunt of this curse jew or nonjew as they hear the solemn words from the lips of the judge of heaven and earth depart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angelsmatt 25 41 the new covenant standard for blessing is no longer the view that one takes of israel after the flesh the new covenant standard for blessing or for cursing now has become ones view of christ jesus listen to the words of the apostle paul grace be with all those that love our lord jesus christ with a love incorruptible eph 6 24 here we see the wondrous blessing observe how it hinges on love for the person of jesus christ notice the scripture does not state that grace or blessing be with all those that love israel after the flesh the next part of the equation is also recorded by paul if anyone does not love the lord let him be accursed 1cor 16 22 there is the terrible curse notice carefully what it does not say if anyone does not love israel after the flesh let him be accursed the simple new testament truth is that in christ jesus is the only place where blessing is to be found outside of him nothing but destruction ruin and devastation remains he is the one who is most blessed forever psalm 21 6 and those who are in him and them alone are blessed to despise him and by virtue of his vital union with his church which is his body to despise his church is to bring the curse of god down upon ones head once again observe the words of the apostle paul for after all it is only just for god to repay with affliction those who afflict you his saints note mine and to give relief to you who are afflicted and to us as well when the lord jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire dealing out retribution to those who do not know god and to those who do not obey the gospel of our lord jesus and these will pay the penalty of eternal destruction 2 thes 1 69 paul of all men knew firsthand the depth of the union between christ and his beloved church formerly as saul of tarsus he was breathing out threatenings against the church as recorded in the book of acts and was met by these words from the risen and exalted christ saul saul why dost thou persecute me acts 94 notice again it was not israel after the flesh that saul was persecuting it was the church what makes this even more striking is the fact that paul belonged to the nation of israel after the flesh at the very time he was doing this such is the union between christ jesus and his church that to attempt to injure the one is to attempt to injure christ what is done to his church is reckoned as if done to him and woe be to that man or woman who lifts a hand against the church of the lord jesus christ they may escape the curse in this life but they certainly shall not escape it in the next this truth serves to set forth the main danger that this writer sees in the entire dispensational scheme of things it removes christ from the center of attention and robs him of his preeminence and shifts the entire focus upon the earthly nation of israel the standard now becomes not what do you think of jesus christ but rather what do you think of natural israel one searches in vain through the entirety of the new testament to find any support for this outlandish notion yet in spite of that these stalwarts for earthly israel continue to stubbornly adhere to this discombobulated notion and thereby only foster the spirit of pride and selfrighteousness among the jews that produced their ruin in the first place they lull the jews who desperately stand in need of redemption by christ into a false sense of security by catering to their blind delusion that somehow they are all going to get a second chance somewhere off in the future someday whereas the scriptures state that now is the acceptable time now is the day of salvation 2 cor 6 2 the dispensationalists say now is not the acceptable time now is not the day of salvation one is still yet to come for you dont fret if you miss it now god is preparing a special time just for you alas for the apostle paul if he had been privy to such wondrous wisdom and insight into gods prophetic plan as the dispenationalists claim to possess he could have saved himself a lot of needless trouble and simply informed his brethren after the flesh of this great truth and thereby endeared himself to their hearts and ensured himself of their favor the simple truth is that if one believes the words of the scriptures to have any meaning whatsoever one comes to the inescapable conclusion that the earthly nation of israel has been rejected and taken as a whole are no more the chosen people of god than are the arabs and the lord said name him loammi for you are not my people and i am not your god yet the number of the sons of israel will be like the sand of the sea which cannot be measured or numbered and it will come about that in the place where it is said to them you are not my people it will be said to them you are the sons of the living god hosea 1 910 this amazing prophecy uttered by hosea so many years prior to christs coming is quoted by both the apostle paul and the apostle peter in their various letters to the church in both cases they refer the latter part of this startling prophecy to the church romans 9 2326 and 1 peter 2 10 israel as a nation was to be disowned yet a new israel would arise that would encompass both jew and gentile it is they who would be called the people of god they and they alone would be the sons of the living god the cause of this disowning of israel after the flesh by jehovah would be the rejection of their promised shepherd whom they would betray for thirty pieces of silver that was the last straw so to speak the national covenant that was between the nation and jehovah would subsequently be broken irrevocably the entire scenario was seen in vision form long before it happened by the prophet zechariah then i said i will not pasture you what is to die let it die and what is to be annihilated let it be annihilated and let those who are left eat one anothers flesh and i took my staff favor and cut it into pieces to break my covenant which i had made with all the peoples so it was broken on that day and thus the afflicted of the flock who were watching me realized that it was the word of the lord and i said to them if it is good in your sight give me my wages but if not never mind so they weighed out thirty shekels of silver as my wages zech 11 912 nothing could be clearer the national covenant between god and earthly israel is over it has been broken and totally abrogated never to be resurrected again henceforth salvation is to come to those among the jews that are part of gods elect in the exact same manner as it comes to us who are gentiles through repentance and faith in the proclamation of the glorious gospel of the lord jesus christ truly they will not see him until they say blessed is he who comes in the name of the lord until jesus of nazareth is owned as the true messiah the jew of today remains as dead in sins and trespasses as anyone else he does not have some special way of salvation granted him that is different than provided to the gentiles as long as he continues to reject christ jesus the words of the lord jesus still continue to apply he who hates me hates my father also john 15 23 one thing is absolutely certain all the haters of christ jesus lie under the anathema of the great god of heaven and earth and no one who hates this god has any right to think of him or herself as one of his chosen people this kind of temerity is a recipe for eternal disaster what a travesty that the misguided system foisted upon gullible christians by dispensational theology has only perpetuated their vain hope one can only pray that god will smite this entire system and dash it to the ground may he be pleased to use this weak effort on this authors part to do so even if it is only a small part the entire edifice must be thrown down so that the truth may be clearly seen once again",

elections especially with a view to predicting future results election is the fact of electing or being elected to elect means to select or to nominate and so sometimes other forms of ballot such as referendums are referred to as elections especially in the united states history elections were used as early in history as ancient greece and ancient rome and throughout the medieval period to select rulers such as the holy roman emperor see imperial election and the pope see papal election the pala king gopala ruled c 750s 770s ce in early medieval bengal was elected by a group of feudal chieftains such elections were quite common in contemporary societies of the region in the chola empire around 920 ce in uthiramerur in presentday tamil nadu palm leaves were used for selecting the village committee members the leaves with candidate names written on them were put inside a mud pot to select the committee members a young boy was asked to take out as many leaves as the number of positions available this was known as the kudavolai system the first recorded popular elections of officials to public office by majority vote where all citizens were eligible both to vote and to hold public office date back to the ephors of sparta in 754 bc under the mixed government of the spartan constitution athenian democratic elections where all citizens could hold public office were not introduced for another 247 years until the reforms of cleisthenes under the earlier solonian constitution c 574 bc all athenian citizens were eligible to vote in the popular assemblies on matters of law and policy and as jurors but only the three highest classes of citizens could vote in elections nor were the lowest of the four classes of athenian citizens as defined by the extent of their wealth and property rather than by birth eligible to hold public office through the reforms of solon the spartan election of the ephors therefore also predates the reforms of solon in athens by approximately 180 years questions of suffrage especially suffrage for minority groups have dominated the history of elections males the dominant cultural group in north america and europe often dominated the electorate and continue to do so in many countries early elections in countries such as the united kingdom and the united states were dominated by landed or ruling class males by 1920 all western european and north american democracies had universal adult male suffrage except switzerland and many countries began to consider womens suffrage despite legally mandated universal suffrage for adult males political barriers were sometimes erected to prevent fair access to elections see civil rights movement contexts elections are held in a variety of political organizational and corporate settings many countries hold elections to select people to serve in their governments but other types of organizations hold elections as well for example many corporations hold elections among shareholders to select a board of directors and these elections may be mandated by corporate law in many places an election to the government is usually a competition among people who have already won a primary election within a political party elections within corporations and other organizations often use procedures and rules that are similar to those of governmental elections electorate suffrage the question of who may vote is a central issue in elections the electorate does not generally include the entire population for example many countries prohibit those who are under the age of majority from voting all jurisdictions require a minimum age for voting in australia aboriginal people were not given the right to vote until 1962 see 1967 referendum entry and in 2010 the federal government removed the rights of prisoners serving for three years or more to vote a large proportion of whom were aboriginal australians suffrage is typically only for citizens of the country though further limits may be imposed in the european union one can vote in municipal elections if one lives in the municipality and is an eu citizen the nationality of the country of residence is not required in some countries voting is required by law eligible voters may be subject to punitive measures such as a fine for not casting a vote in western australia the penalty for a first time offender failing to vote is a 2000 fine which increases to 5000 if the offender refused to vote prior voting population historically the size of eligible voters the electorate was small having the size of groups or communities of privileged men like aristocrats and men of a city citizens with the growth of the number of people with bourgeois citizen rights outside of cities expanding the term citizen the electorates grew to numbers beyond the thousands elections with an electorate in the hundred thousands appeared in the final decades of the roman republic by extending voting rights to citizens outside of rome with the lex julia of 90 bc reaching an electorate of 910000 and estimated voter turnout of maximum 10 in 70 bc only again comparable in size to the first elections of the united states at the same time the kingdom of great britain had in 1780 about 214000 eligible voters 3 of the whole population naturalization can reshape the electorate of a country candidates a representative democracy requires a procedure to govern nomination for political office in many cases nomination for office is mediated through preselection processes in organized political parties nonpartisan systems tend to be different from partisan systems as concerns nominations in a direct democracy one type of nonpartisan democracy any eligible person can be nominated although elections were used in ancient athens in rome and in the selection of popes and holy roman emperors the origins of elections in the contemporary world lie in the gradual emergence of representative government in europe and north america beginning in the 17th century in some systems no nominations take place at all with voters free to choose any person at the time of votingwith some possible exceptions such as through a minimum age requirementin the jurisdiction in such cases it is not required or even possible that the members of the electorate be familiar with all of the eligible persons though such systems may involve indirect elections at larger geographic levels to ensure that some firsthand familiarity among potential electees can exist at these levels ie among the elected delegates systems electoral systems are the detailed constitutional arrangements and voting systems that convert the vote into a political decision the first step is for voters to cast the ballots which may be simple singlechoice ballots but other types such as multiple choice or ranked ballots may also be used then the votes are tallied for which various vote counting systems may be used and the voting system then determines the result on the basis of the tally most systems can be categorized as either proportional majoritarian or mixed among the proportional systems the most commonly used are partylist proportional representation list pr systems among majoritarian are firstpastthepost electoral system single winner plurality voting and different methods of majority voting such as the widely used tworound system mixed systems combine elements of both proportional and majoritarian methods with some typically producing results closer to the former mixedmember proportional or the other eg parallel voting many countries have growing electoral reform movements which advocate systems such as approval voting single transferable vote instant runoff voting or a condorcet method these methods are also gaining popularity for lesser elections in some countries where more important elections still use more traditional counting methods while openness and accountability are usually considered cornerstones of a democratic system the act of casting a vote and the content of a voters ballot are usually an important exception the secret ballot is a relatively modern development but it is now considered crucial in most free and fair elections as it limits the effectiveness of intimidation campaigns when elections are called politicians and their supporters attempt to influence policy by competing directly for the votes of constituents in what are called campaigns supporters for a campaign can be either formally organized or loosely affiliated and frequently utilize campaign advertising it is common for political scientists to attempt to predict elections via political forecasting methods the most expensive election campaign included us7 billion spent on the 2012 united states presidential election and is followed by the us5 billion spent on the 2014 indian general election timing the nature of democracy is that elected officials are accountable to the people and they must return to the voters at prescribed intervals to seek their mandate to continue in office for that reason most democratic constitutions provide that elections are held at fixed regular intervals in the united states elections for public offices are typically held between every two and six years in most states and at the federal level with exceptions for elected judicial positions that may have longer terms of office there is a variety of schedules for example presidents the president of ireland is elected every seven years the president of russia and the president of finland every six years the president of france every five years president of the united states every four years predetermined or fixed election dates have the advantage of fairness and predictability they tend to greatly lengthen campaigns and make dissolving the legislature parliamentary system more problematic if the date should happen to fall at a time when dissolution is inconvenient eg when war breaks out other states eg the united kingdom only set maximum time in office and the executive decides exactly when within that limit it will actually go to the polls in practice this means the government remains in power for close to its full term and chooses an election date it calculates to be in its best interests unless something special happens such as a motion of noconfidence this calculation depends on a number of variables such as its performance in opinion polls and the size of its majority postponing elections beyond the full term has been associated with democratic backsliding snap elections are early elections before the full term of office rolling elections are elections in which all representatives in a body are elected but these elections are spread over a period of time rather than all at once examples are the presidential primaries in the united states elections to the european parliament where due to differing election laws in each member state elections are held on different days of the same week and due to logistics general elections in lebanon and india the voting procedure in the legislative assemblies of the roman republic are also a classical example in rolling elections voters have information about previous voters choices while in the first elections there may be plenty of hopeful candidates in the last rounds consensus on one winner is generally achieved in todays context of rapid communication candidates can put disproportionate resources into competing strongly in the first few stages because those stages affect the reaction of latter stages undemocratic or unfair in many of the countries with weak rule of law the most common reason why elections do not meet international standards of being free and fair is interference from the incumbent government dictators may use the powers of the executive police martial law censorship physical implementation of the election mechanism etc to remain in power despite popular opinion in favour of removal members of a particular faction in a legislature may use the power of the majority or supermajority passing criminal laws and defining the electoral mechanisms including eligibility and district boundaries to prevent the balance of power in the body from shifting to a rival faction due to an election nongovernmental entities can also interfere with elections through physical force verbal intimidation or fraud which can result in improper casting or counting of votes monitoring for and minimizing electoral fraud is also an ongoing task in countries with strong traditions of free and fair elections problems that prevent an election from being free and fair take various forms lack of open political debate or an informed electorate the electorate may be poorly informed about issues or candidates due to lack of freedom of the press lack of objectivity in the press due to state or corporate control or lack of access to news and political media freedom of speech may be curtailed by the state favouring certain viewpoints or state propaganda scheduling frequent elections can also lead to voter fatigue violation of political egalitarianism gerrymandering wasted votes and manipulating electoral thresholds can prevent that all votes count equally interference with campaigns exclusion of opposition candidates from eligibility for office needlessly high nomination rules on who may be a candidate are some of the ways the structure of an election can be changed to favour a specific faction or candidate those in power may arrest or assassinate candidates suppress or even criminalize campaigning close campaign headquarters harass or beat campaign workers or intimidate voters with violence foreign electoral intervention can also occur with the united states interfering between 1946 and 2000 in 81 elections and russia or the soviet union in 36 in 2018 the most intense interventions utilizing false information were by china in taiwan and by russia in latvia the next highest levels were in bahrain qatar and hungary tampering with mechanisms this can include falsifying voter instructions violation of the secret ballot ballot stuffing tampering with voting machines destruction of legitimately cast ballots voter suppression voter registration fraud failure to validate voter residency fraudulent tabulation of results and use of physical force or verbal intimation at polling places other examples include persuading candidates not to run such as through blackmailing bribery intimidation or physical violence shams a sham election or show election is an election that is held purely for show that is without any significant political choice or real impact on the results of the election sham elections are a common event in dictatorial regimes that feel the need to feign the appearance of public legitimacy published results usually show high voter turnout and high support typically at least 80 and close to 100 in many cases for the prescribed candidates or for the referendum choice that favours the political party in power dictatorial regimes can also organize sham elections with results simulating those that might be achieved in democratic countries sometimes only one governmentapproved candidate is allowed to run in sham elections with no opposition candidates allowed or opposition candidates are arrested on false charges or even without any charges before the election to prevent them from running ballots may contain only one yes option or in the case of a simple yes or no question security forces often persecute people who pick no thus encouraging them to pick the yes option in other cases those who vote receive stamps in their passport for doing so while those who did not vote and thus do not receive stamps are persecuted as enemies of the people sham elections can sometimes backfire against the party in power especially if the regime believes they are popular enough to win without coercion fraud or suppressing the opposition the most famous example of this was the 1990 myanmar general election in which the governmentsponsored national unity party suffered a landslide defeat by the opposition national league for democracy and consequently the results were annulled aristocratic some scholars argue that the predominance of elections in modern liberal democracies masks the fact that they are actually aristocratic selection mechanisms that deny each citizen an equal chance of holding public office such views were expressed as early as the time of ancient greece by aristotle according to french political scientist bernard manin the inegalitarian nature of elections stems from four factors the unequal treatment of candidates by voters the distinction of candidates required by choice the cognitive advantage conferred by salience and the costs of disseminating information these four factors result in the evaluation of candidates based on voters partial standards of quality and social saliency for example skin colour and good looks this leads to selfselection biases in candidate pools due to unobjective standards of treatment by voters and the costs barriers to entry associated with raising ones political profile ultimately the result is the election of candidates who are superior whether in actuality or as perceived within a cultural context and objectively unlike the voters they are supposed to represent evidence suggests that the concept of electing representatives was originally conceived to be different from democracy prior to the 18th century some societies in western europe used sortition as a means to select rulers a method which allowed regular citizens to exercise power in keeping with understandings of democracy at the time the idea of what constituted a legitimate government shifted in the 18th century to include consent especially with the rise of the enlightenment from this point onward sortition fell out of favor as a mechanism for selecting rulers on the other hand elections began to be seen as a way for the masses to express popular consent repeatedly resulting in the triumph of the electoral process until the present day this conceptual misunderstanding of elections as open and egalitarian when they are not innately so may thus be a root cause of the problems in contemporary governance those in favor of this view argue that the modern system of elections was never meant to give ordinary citizens the chance to exercise power merely privileging their right to consent to those who rule th",
