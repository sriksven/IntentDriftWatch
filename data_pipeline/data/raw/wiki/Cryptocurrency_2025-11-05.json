    "a cryptocurrency colloquially crypto is a digital currency designed to work through a computer network that is not reliant on any central authority such as a government or bank to uphold or maintain it however a type of cryptocurrency called a stablecoin may rely upon government action or legislation to require that a stable value be upheld and maintained individual coin ownership records are stored in a digital ledger or blockchain which is a computerized database that uses a consensus mechanism to secure transaction records control the creation of additional coins and verify the transfer of coin ownership the two most common consensus mechanisms are proof of work and proof of stake despite the name which has come to describe many of the fungible blockchain tokens that have been created cryptocurrencies are not considered to be currencies in the traditional sense and varying legal treatments have been applied to them in various jurisdictions including classification as commodities securities and currencies cryptocurrencies are generally viewed as a distinct asset class in practice the first cryptocurrency was bitcoin which was first released as opensource software in 2009 as of june 2023 there were more than 25000 other cryptocurrencies in the marketplace of which more than 40 had a market capitalization exceeding 1 billion as of april 2025 the cryptocurrency market capitalization was already estimated at 276 trillion history in 1983 american cryptographer david chaum conceived of a type of cryptographic electronic money called ecash later in 1995 he implemented it through digicash an early form of cryptographic electronic payments digicash required user software in order to withdraw notes from a bank and designate specific encrypted keys before they could be sent to a recipient this allowed the digital currency to be untraceable by a third party in 1996 the national security agency published a paper entitled how to make a mint the cryptography of anonymous electronic cash describing a cryptocurrency system the paper was first published in an mit mailing list october 1996 and later april 1997 in the american law review in 1998 wei dai described bmoney an anonymous distributed electronic cash system shortly thereafter nick szabo described bit gold like bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies that would follow it bit gold not to be confused with the later goldbased exchange bitgold was described as an electronic currency system that required users to complete a proof of work function with solutions being cryptographically put together and published in january 2009 bitcoin was created by pseudonymous developer satoshi nakamoto it used sha256 a cryptographic hash function in its proofofwork scheme in april 2011 namecoin was created as an attempt at forming a decentralized dns in october 2011 litecoin was released which used scrypt as its hash function instead of sha256 peercoin created in august 2012 used a hybrid of proofofwork and proofofstake cryptocurrency has undergone several periods of growth and retraction including several bubbles and market crashes such as in 2011 2013201415 20172018 and 20212023 in august 2014 the uk announced its treasury had commissioned a study of cryptocurrencies and what role if any they could play in the uk economy the study was also to report on whether regulation should be considered its final report was published in 2018 and it issued a consultation on cryptoassets and stablecoins in january 2021 in june 2021 el salvador became the first country to accept bitcoin as legal tender after the legislative assembly had voted 6222 to pass a bill submitted by president nayib bukele classifying the cryptocurrency as such in august 2021 cuba followed with resolution 215 to recognize and regulate cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin in september 2021 the government of china the single largest market for cryptocurrency declared all cryptocurrency transactions illegal this completed a crackdown on cryptocurrency that had previously banned the operation of intermediaries and miners within china in september 2022 the worlds second largest cryptocurrency at that time ethereum transitioned its consensus mechanism from proofofwork pow to proofofstake pos in an upgrade process known as the merge according to the ethereum founder the upgrade would cut both ethereums energy use and carbondioxide emissions by 999 on 11 november 2022 ftx trading ltd a cryptocurrency exchange which also operated a crypto hedge fund and had been valued at 18 billion filed for bankruptcy the financial impact of the collapse extended beyond the immediate ftx customer base as reported while at a reuters conference financial industry executives said that regulators must step in to protect crypto investors technology analyst avivah litan commented on the cryptocurrency ecosystem that everythingneeds to improve dramatically in terms of user experience controls safety customer service formal definition according to jan lansky a cryptocurrency is a system that meets six conditions the system does not require a central authority its state is maintained through distributed consensus the system keeps an overview of cryptocurrency units and their ownership the system defines whether new cryptocurrency units can be created if new cryptocurrency units can be created the system defines the circumstances of their origin and how to determine the ownership of these new units ownership of cryptocurrency units can be proved exclusively cryptographically the system allows transactions to be performed in which ownership of the cryptographic units is changed a transaction statement can only be issued by an entity proving the current ownership of these units if two different instructions for changing the ownership of the same cryptographic units are simultaneously entered the system performs at most one of them in march 2018 the word cryptocurrency was added to the merriamwebster dictionary altcoins after the early innovation of bitcoin in 2008 and the early network effect gained by bitcoin tokens cryptocurrencies and other digital assets that were not bitcoin became collectively known during the 2010s as alternative cryptocurrencies or altcoins sometimes the term alt coins was used or disparagingly shitcoins paul vigna of the wall street journal described altcoins in 2020 as alternative versions of bitcoin given its role as the model protocol for cryptocurrency designers a polytechnic university of catalonia thesis in 2021 used a broader description including not only alternative versions of bitcoin but every cryptocurrency other than bitcoin as of early 2020 there were more than 5000 cryptocurrencies altcoins often have underlying differences when compared to bitcoin for example litecoin aims to process a block every 25 minutes rather than bitcoins 10 minutes which allows litecoin to confirm transactions faster than bitcoin another example is ethereum which has smart contract functionality that allows decentralized applications to be run on its blockchain ethereum was the most used blockchain in 2020 according to bloomberg news in 2016 it had the largest following of any altcoin according to the new york times significant market price rallies across multiple altcoin markets are often referred to as an altseason stablecoins stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable level of purchasing power notably these designs are not foolproof as a number of stablecoins have crashed or lost their peg for example on 11 may 2022 terras stablecoin ust fell from 1 to 26 cents the subsequent failure of terraform labs resulted in the loss of nearly 40b invested in the terra and luna coins in september 2022 south korean prosecutors requested the issuance of an interpol red notice against the companys founder do kwon in hong kong the expected regulatory framework for stablecoins in 202324 is being shaped and includes a few considerations memecoins memecoins are a category of cryptocurrencies that originated from internet memes or jokes the most notable example is dogecoin a memecoin featuring the shiba inu dog from the doge meme memecoins are known for extreme volatility for example the recordhigh value for a dogecoin was 73 cents but that had plunged to 13 cents by mid2024 scams are prolific among memecoins physical crypto physical cryptocurrency coins have been made as promotional items and some have become collectibles some of these have a private key embedded in them to access crypto worth a few dollars there have also been attempts to issue bitcoin bank notes the term physical bitcoin is used in the finance industry when investment funds that hold crypto purchased from crypto exchanges put their crypto holdings in a specialised bank called a custodian these physical representations of cryptocurrency do not hold any value by themselves these are only utilized for collectable purposes for example the first incarnation of the bitcoin casascius coins made of silver brass or aluminum sometimes with gold plating or titan bitcoin which in silver or gold versions are sought after by numismatists architecture cryptocurrency is produced by an entire cryptocurrency system collectively at a rate that is defined when the system is created and that is publicly stated in centralized banking and economic systems such as the us federal reserve system corporate boards or governments control the supply of currency in the case of cryptocurrency companies or governments cannot produce new units and have not so far provided backing for other firms banks or corporate entities that hold asset value measured in it the underlying technical system upon which cryptocurrencies are based was created by satoshi nakamoto within a proofofwork system such as bitcoin the safety integrity and balance of ledgers are maintained by a community of mutually distrustful parties referred to as miners miners use their computers to help validate and timestamp transactions adding them to the ledger in accordance with a particular timestamping scheme in a proofofstake blockchain transactions are validated by holders of the associated cryptocurrency sometimes grouped together in stake pools most cryptocurrencies are designed to gradually decrease the production of that currency placing a cap on the total amount of that currency that will ever be in circulation compared with ordinary currencies held by financial institutions or kept as cash on hand cryptocurrencies can be more difficult for seizure by law enforcement blockchain the validity of each cryptocurrencys coins is provided by a blockchain a blockchain is a continuously growing list of records called blocks which are linked and secured using cryptography each block typically contains a hash pointer as a link to a previous block a timestamp and transaction data by design blockchains are inherently resistant to modification of the data a blockchain is an open distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way for use as a distributed ledger a blockchain is typically managed by a peertopeer network collectively adhering to a protocol for validating new blocks once recorded the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all subsequent blocks which requires collusion of the network majority blockchains are secure by design and are an example of a distributed computing system with high byzantine fault tolerance decentralized consensus has therefore been achieved with a blockchain nodes a node is a computer that connects to a cryptocurrency network the node supports the cryptocurrencys network through either relaying transactions validation or hosting a copy of the blockchain in terms of relaying transactions each network computer node has a copy of the blockchain of the cryptocurrency it supports when a transaction is made the node creating the transaction broadcasts details of the transaction using encryption to other nodes throughout the node network so that the transaction and every other transaction is known node owners are either volunteers those hosted by the organization or body responsible for developing the cryptocurrency blockchain network technology or those who are enticed to host a node to receive rewards from hosting the node network timestamping cryptocurrencies use various timestamping schemes to prove the validity of transactions added to the blockchain ledger without the need for a trusted third party the first timestamping scheme invented was the proofofwork scheme the most widely used proofofwork schemes are based on sha256 and scrypt some other hashing algorithms that are used for proofofwork include cryptonote blake sha3 and x11 another method is called the proofofstake scheme proofofstake is a method of securing a cryptocurrency network and achieving distributed consensus through requesting users to show ownership of a certain amount of currency it is different from proofofwork systems that run difficult hashing algorithms to validate electronic transactions the scheme is largely dependent on the coin and there is currently no standard form of it some cryptocurrencies use a combined proofofwork and proofofstake scheme mining on a blockchain mining is the validation of transactions for this effort successful miners obtain new cryptocurrency as a reward the reward decreases transaction fees by creating a complementary incentive to contribute to the processing power of the network the rate of generating hashes which validate any transaction has been increased by the use of specialized hardware such as fpgas and asics running complex hashing algorithms like sha256 and scrypt this arms race for cheaperyetefficient machines has existed since bitcoin was introduced in 2009 mining is measured by hash rate typically in ths a 2023 imf working paper found that crypto mining could generate 450 million tons of co2 emissions by 2027 accounting for 07 percent of global emissions or 12 percent of the world total with more people entering the world of virtual currency generating hashes for validation has become more complex over time forcing miners to invest increasingly large sums of money to improve computing performance consequently the reward for finding a hash has diminished and often does not justify the investment in equipment and cooling facilities to mitigate the heat the equipment produces and the electricity required to run them popular regions for mining include those with inexpensive electricity a cold climate and jurisdictions with clear and conducive regulations by july 2019 bitcoins electricity consumption was estimated to be approximately 7 gigawatts around 02 of the global total or equivalent to the energy consumed nationally by switzerland some miners pool resources sharing their processing power over a network to split the reward equally according to the amount of work they contributed to the probability of finding a block a share is awarded to members of the mining pool who present a valid partial proofofwork as of february 2018 the chinese government has halted trading of virtual currency banned initial coin offerings and shut down mining many chinese miners have since relocated to canada and texas one company is operating data centers for mining operations at canadian oil and gas field sites due to low gas prices in june 2018 hydro quebec proposed to the provincial government to allocate 500 megawatts of power to crypto companies for mining according to a february 2018 report from fortune iceland has become a haven for cryptocurrency miners in part because of its cheap electricity in march 2018 the city of plattsburgh new york put an 18month moratorium on all cryptocurrency mining in an effort to preserve natural resources and the character and direction of the city in 2021 kazakhstan became the secondbiggest cryptocurrency mining country producing 181 of the global exahash rate the country built a compound containing 50000 computers near ekibastuz gpu price rise an increase in cryptocurrency mining increased the demand for graphics cards gpu in 2017 the computing power of gpus makes them wellsuited to generating hashes popular favorites of cryptocurrency miners such as nvidias gtx 1060 and gtx 1070 graphics cards as well as amds rx 570 and rx 580 gpus doubled or tripled in price or were out of stock a gtx 1070 ti which was released at a price of 450 sold for as much as 1100 another popular card the gtx 1060 6 gb model was released at an msrp of 250 and sold for almost 500 rx 570 and rx 580 cards from amd were out of stock for almost a year miners regularly buy up the entire stock of new gpus as soon as they are available nvidia has asked retailers to do what they can when it comes to selling gpus to gamers instead of miners boris bhles pr manager for nvidia in the german region said gamers come first for nvidia mining accelerator chips numerous companies developed dedicated cryptomining accelerator chips capable of priceperformance far higher than that of cpu or gpu mining at one point intel marketed its own brand of crypto accelerator chip named blockscale wallets a cryptocurrency wallet is a means of storing the public and private keys address or seed which can be used to receive or spend the cryptocurrency with the private key it is possible to write in the public ledger effectively spending the associated cryptocurrency with the public key it is possible for others to send currency to the wallet there exist multiple methods of storing keys or seed in a wallet these methods range from using paper wallets which are public private or seed keys written on paper to using hardware wallets which are hardware to store your wallet information to a digital wallet which is a computer with software hosting your wallet information to hosting your wallet using an exchange where cryptocurrency is traded or by storing your wallet information on a digital medium such as plaintext anonymity bitcoin is pseudonymous rather than anonymous the cryptocurrency in a wallet is not tied to a person but rather to one or more specific keys or addresses thereby bitcoin owners are not immediately identifiable but all transactions are publicly available in the blockchain still cryptocurrency exchanges are often required by law to collect the personal information of their users some cryptocurrencies such as monero zerocoin zerocash and cryptonote implement additional measures to increase privacy such as by using zeroknowledge proofs a recent 2020 study presented different attacks on privacy in cryptocurrencies the attacks demonstrated how the anonymity techniques are not sufficient safeguards in order to improve privacy researchers suggested several different ideas including new cryptographic schemes and mechanisms for hiding the ip address of the source economics cryptocurrencies are used primarily outside banking and governmental institutions and are exchanged over the internet block rewards proofofwork cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin offer block rewards incentives for miners there has been an implicit belief that whether miners are paid by block rewards or transaction fees does not affect the security of the blockchain but a study suggests that this may not be the case under certain circumstances the rewards paid to miners increase the supply of the cryptocurrency by making sure that verifying"
