    "space exploration is the physical investigation of outer space by uncrewed robotic space probes and through human spaceflight while the observation of objects in space known as astronomy predates reliable recorded history it was the development of large and relatively efficient rockets during the midtwentieth century that allowed physical space exploration to become a reality common rationales for exploring space include advancing scientific research national prestige uniting different nations ensuring the future survival of humanity and developing military and strategic advantages against other countries the early era of space exploration was driven by a space race in which the soviet union and the united states vied to demonstrate their technological superiority landmarks of this era include the launch of the first humanmade object to orbit earth the soviet unions sputnik 1 on 4 october 1957 and the first moon landing by the american apollo 11 mission on 20 july 1969 the soviet space program achieved many of the first milestones including the first living being in orbit in 1957 the first human spaceflight yuri gagarin aboard vostok 1 in 1961 the first spacewalk by alexei leonov on 18 march 1965 the first automatic landing on another celestial body in 1966 and the launch of the first space station salyut 1 in 1971 in the 1970s focus shifted from oneoff flights to renewable hardware such as the space shuttle program and from competition to cooperation the foremost example being the international space station iss built between 1998 and 2011 the 2000s brought advancements in the national spaceexploration programs of china the european union japan and india the 2010s saw the rise of the private space industry in earnest with the development of private launch vehicles space capsules and satellite manufacturing in the 2020s the two primary global programs gaining traction are moonfocused the chineseled international lunar research station and the usled artemis program with its plan to build the lunar gateway and the artemis base camp each with a set of international partners history of exploration first telescopes the first telescope is said to have been invented in 1608 in the netherlands by an eyeglass maker named hans lippershey but their first recorded use in astronomy was by galileo galilei in 1609 in 1668 isaac newton built his own reflecting telescope the first fully functional telescope of this kind and a landmark for future developments due to its superior features over the previous galilean telescope a string of discoveries in the solar system and beyond followed then and in the next centuries the mountains of the moon the phases of venus the main satellites of jupiter and saturn the rings of saturn many comets the asteroids the new planets uranus and neptune and many more satellites the orbiting astronomical observatory 2 was the first space telescope launched 1968 but the launch of the hubble space telescope in 1990 set a milestone as of 1 december 2022 there were 5284 confirmed exoplanets discovered the milky way is estimated to contain 100400 billion stars and more than 100 billion planets there are at least 2 trillion galaxies in the observable universe hd1 is the most distant known object from earth reported as 334 billion lightyears away first outer space flights mw 18014 was a german v2 rocket test launch that took place on 20 june 1944 at the peenemnde army research center in peenemnde it was the first humanmade object to reach outer space attaining an apogee of 176 kilometers which is well above the krmn line it was a vertical test launch although the rocket reached space it did not reach orbital velocity and therefore returned to earth in an impact becoming the first suborbital spaceflight in 1949 the bumperwac reached an altitude of 393 kilometres 244 mi becoming the first humanmade object to enter space according to nasa first object in orbit the first successful orbital launch was of the soviet uncrewed sputnik 1 satellite 1 mission on 4 october 1957 the satellite weighed about 83 kg 183 lb and is believed to have orbited earth at a height of about 250 km 160 mi it had two radio transmitters 20 and 40 mhz which emitted beeps that could be heard by radios around the globe analysis of the radio signals was used to gather information about the electron density of the ionosphere while temperature and pressure data were encoded in the duration of radio beeps the results indicated that the satellite was not punctured by a meteoroid sputnik 1 was launched by an r7 rocket it burned up upon reentry on 3 january 1958 first human outer space flight the first successful human spaceflight was vostok 1 east 1 carrying the 27yearold russian cosmonaut yuri gagarin on 12 april 1961 the spacecraft completed one orbit around the globe lasting about 1 hour and 48 minutes gagarins flight resonated around the world it was a demonstration of the advanced soviet space program and it opened an entirely new era in space exploration human spaceflight first astronomical body space explorations the first artificial object to reach another celestial body was luna 2 which reached the moon in 1959 the first soft landing on another celestial body was performed by luna 9 landing on the moon on 3 february 1966 luna 10 became the first artificial satellite of the moon entering in a lunar orbit on 3 april 1966 the first crewed landing on another celestial body was performed by apollo 11 on 20 july 1969 landing on the moon there have been a total of six spacecraft with humans landing on the moon starting from 1969 to the last human landing in 1972 the first interplanetary flyby was the 1961 venera 1 flyby of venus though the 1962 mariner 2 was the first flyby of venus to return data closest approach 34773 kilometers pioneer 6 was the first satellite to orbit the sun launched on 16 december 1965 the other planets were first flown by in 1965 for mars by mariner 4 1973 for jupiter by pioneer 10 1974 for mercury by mariner 10 1979 for saturn by pioneer 11 1986 for uranus by voyager 2 1989 for neptune by voyager 2 in 2015 the dwarf planets ceres and pluto were orbited by dawn and passed by new horizons respectively this accounts for flybys of each of the eight planets in the solar system the sun the moon and ceres and pluto two of the five recognized dwarf planets the first interplanetary surface mission to return at least limited surface data from another planet was the 1970 landing of venera 7 which returned data to earth for 23 minutes from venus in 1975 venera 9 was the first to return images from the surface of another planet returning images from venus in 1971 the mars 3 mission achieved the first soft landing on mars returning data for almost 20 seconds later much longer duration surface missions were achieved including over six years of mars surface operation by viking 1 from 1975 to 1982 and over two hours of transmission from the surface of venus by venera 13 in 1982 the longest ever soviet planetary surface mission venus and mars are the two planets outside of earth on which humans have conducted surface missions with uncrewed robotic spacecraft first space station salyut 1 was the first space station of any kind launched into low earth orbit by the soviet union on 19 april 1971 the international space station iss is currently the largest and oldest of the 2 current fully functional space stations inhabited continuously since the year 2000 the other tiangong space station built by china is now fully crewed and operational first interstellar space flight voyager 1 became the first humanmade object to leave the solar system into interstellar space on 25 august 2012 the probe passed the heliopause at 121 au to enter interstellar space farthest from earth the apollo 13 flight passed the far side of the moon at an altitude of 254 kilometers 158 miles 137 nautical miles above the lunar surface and 400171 km 248655 mi from earth marking the record for the farthest humans have ever traveled from earth in 1970 as of 9 february 2025 voyager 1 was at a distance of 1664 au 2489 billion km 1547 billion mi from earth it is the most distant humanmade object from earth targets of exploration starting in the mid20th century probes and then human missions were sent into earth orbit and then on to the moon also probes were sent throughout the known solar system and into solar orbit uncrewed spacecraft have been sent into orbit around saturn jupiter mars venus and mercury by the 21st century and the most distance active spacecraft voyager 1 and 2 traveled beyond 100 times the earthsun distance the instruments were enough though that it is thought they have left the suns heliosphere a sort of bubble of particles made in the galaxy by the suns solar wind the sun the sun is a major focus of space exploration being above the atmosphere in particular and earths magnetic field gives access to the solar wind and infrared and ultraviolet radiations that cannot reach earths surface the sun generates most space weather which can affect power generation and transmission systems on earth and interfere with and even damage satellites and space probes numerous spacecraft dedicated to observing the sun beginning with the apollo telescope mount have been launched and still others have had solar observation as a secondary objective parker solar probe launched in 2018 will approach the sun to within 19th the orbit of mercury mercury mercury remains the least explored of the terrestrial planets as of may 2013 the mariner 10 and messenger missions have been the only missions that have made close observations of mercury messenger entered orbit around mercury in march 2011 to further investigate the observations made by mariner 10 in 1975 munsell 2006b a third mission to mercury scheduled to arrive in 2025 bepicolombo is to include two probes bepicolombo is a joint mission between japan and the european space agency messenger and bepicolombo are intended to gather complementary data to help scientists understand many of the mysteries discovered by mariner 10s flybys flights to other planets within the solar system are accomplished at a cost in energy which is described by the net change in velocity of the spacecraft or deltav due to the relatively high deltav to reach mercury and its proximity to the sun it is difficult to explore and orbits around it are rather unstable venus venus was the first target of interplanetary flyby and lander missions and despite one of the most hostile surface environments in the solar system has had more landers sent to it nearly all from the soviet union than any other planet in the solar system the first flyby was the 1961 venera 1 though the 1962 mariner 2 was the first flyby to successfully return data mariner 2 has been followed by several other flybys by multiple space agencies often as part of missions using a venus flyby to provide a gravitational assist en route to other celestial bodies in 1967 venera 4 became the first probe to enter and directly examine the atmosphere of venus in 1970 venera 7 became the first successful lander to reach the surface of venus and by 1985 it had been followed by eight additional successful soviet venus landers which provided images and other direct surface data starting in 1975 with the soviet orbiter venera 9 some ten successful orbiter missions have been sent to venus including later missions which were able to map the surface of venus using radar to pierce the obscuring atmosphere earth space exploration has been used as a tool to understand earth as a celestial object orbital missions can provide data for earth that can be difficult or impossible to obtain from a purely groundbased point of reference for example the existence of the van allen radiation belts was unknown until their discovery by the united states first artificial satellite explorer 1 these belts contain radiation trapped by earths magnetic fields which currently renders construction of habitable space stations above 1000 km impractical following this early unexpected discovery a large number of earth observation satellites have been deployed specifically to explore earth from a spacebased perspective these satellites have significantly contributed to the understanding of a variety of earthbased phenomena for instance the hole in the ozone layer was found by an artificial satellite that was exploring earths atmosphere and satellites have allowed for the discovery of archeological sites or geological formations that were difficult or impossible to otherwise identify moon the moon was the first celestial body to be the object of space exploration it holds the distinctions of being the first remote celestial object to be flown by orbited and landed upon by spacecraft and the only remote celestial object ever to be visited by humans in 1959 the soviets obtained the first images of the far side of the moon never previously visible to humans the us exploration of the moon began with the ranger 4 impactor in 1962 starting in 1966 the soviets successfully deployed a number of landers to the moon which were able to obtain data directly from the moons surface just four months later surveyor 1 marked the debut of a successful series of us landers the soviet uncrewed missions culminated in the lunokhod program in the early 1970s which included the first uncrewed rovers and also successfully brought lunar soil samples to earth for study this marked the first and to date the only automated return of extraterrestrial soil samples to earth uncrewed exploration of the moon continues with various nations periodically deploying lunar orbiters chinas change 4 in 2019 and change 6 in 2024 achieved the worlds first landing and sample return on the far side of the moon indias chandrayaan3 in 2023 achieved the worlds first landing on the lunar south pole region crewed exploration of the moon began in 1968 with the apollo 8 mission that successfully orbited the moon the first time any extraterrestrial object was orbited by humans in 1969 the apollo 11 mission marked the first time humans set foot upon another world crewed exploration of the moon did not continue for long the apollo 17 mission in 1972 marked the sixth landing and the most recent human visit artemis ii is scheduled to complete a crewed flyby of the moon in 2025 and artemis iii will perform the first lunar landing since apollo 17 with it scheduled for launch no earlier than 2026 robotic missions are still pursued vigorously mars the exploration of mars has been an important part of the space exploration programs of the soviet union later russia the united states europe japan and india dozens of robotic spacecraft including orbiters landers and rovers have been launched toward mars since the 1960s these missions were aimed at gathering data about current conditions and answering questions about the history of mars the questions raised by the scientific community are expected to not only give a better appreciation of the red planet but also yield further insight into the past and possible future of earth the exploration of mars has come at a considerable financial cost with roughly twothirds of all spacecraft destined for mars failing before completing their missions with some failing before they even began such a high failure rate can be attributed to the complexity and large number of variables involved in an interplanetary journey and has led researchers to jokingly speak of the great galactic ghoul which subsists on a diet of mars probes this phenomenon is also informally known as the mars curse in contrast to overall high failure rates in the exploration of mars india has become the first country to achieve success of its maiden attempt indias mars orbiter mission mom is one of the least expensive interplanetary missions ever undertaken with an approximate total cost of 450 crore us73 million the first mission to mars by any arab country has been taken up by the united arab emirates called the emirates mars mission it was launched on 19 july 2020 and went into orbit around mars on 9 february 2021 the uncrewed exploratory probe was named hope probe and was sent to mars to study its atmosphere in detail phobos the russian space mission fobosgrunt which launched on 9 november 2011 experienced a failure leaving it stranded in low earth orbit it was to begin exploration of the phobos and martian circumterrestrial orbit and study whether the moons of mars or at least phobos could be a transshipment point for spaceships traveling to mars asteroids until the advent of space travel objects in the asteroid belt were merely pinpricks of light in even the largest telescopes their shapes and terrain remaining a mystery several asteroids have now been visited by probes the first of which was galileo which flew past two 951 gaspra in 1991 followed by 243 ida in 1993 both of these lay near enough to galileos planned trajectory to jupiter that they could be visited at acceptable cost the first landing on an asteroid was performed by the near shoemaker probe in 2000 following an orbital survey of the object 433 eros the dwarf planet ceres and the asteroid 4 vesta two of the three largest asteroids were visited by nasas dawn spacecraft launched in 2007 hayabusa was a robotic spacecraft developed by the japan aerospace exploration agency to return a sample of material from the small nearearth asteroid 25143 itokawa to earth for further analysis hayabusa was launched on 9 may 2003 and rendezvoused with itokawa in midseptember 2005 after arriving at itokawa hayabusa studied the asteroids shape spin topography color composition density and history in november 2005 it landed on the asteroid twice to collect samples the spacecraft returned to earth on 13 june 2010 jupiter the exploration of jupiter has consisted solely of a number of automated nasa spacecraft visiting the planet since 1973 a large majority of the missions have been flybys in which detailed observations are taken without the probe landing or entering orbit such as in pioneer and voyager programs the galileo and juno spacecraft are the only spacecraft to have entered the planets orbit as jupiter is believed to have only a relatively small rocky core and no real solid surface a landing mission is precluded reaching jupiter from earth requires a deltav of 92 kms which is comparable to the 97 kms deltav needed to reach low earth orbit fortunately gravity assists through planetary flybys can be used to reduce the energy required at launch to reach jupiter albeit at the cost of a significantly longer flight duration jupiter has 95 known moons many of which have relatively little known information about them saturn saturn has been explored only through uncrewed spacecraft launched by nasa including one mission cassinihuygens planned and executed in cooperation with other space agencies these missions consist of flybys in 1979 by pioneer 11 in 1980 by voyager 1 in 1982 by voyager 2 and an orbital mission by the cassini spacecraft which lasted from 2004 until 2017 saturn has at least 62 known moons although the exact number is debatable since saturns rings are made up of vast numbers of independently orbiting objects of varying sizes the largest of the moons is titan which holds the distinction of being the only moon in the solar system with an atmosphere denser and thicker than that of earth titan holds the distinction of being the only object in the outer sol"
