    "artificial intelligence ai is the capability of computational systems to perform tasks typically associated with human intelligence such as learning reasoning problemsolving perception and decisionmaking it is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals highprofile applications of ai include advanced web search engines eg google search recommendation systems used by youtube amazon and netflix virtual assistants eg google assistant siri and alexa autonomous vehicles eg waymo generative and creative tools eg language models and ai art and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games eg chess and go however many ai applications are not perceived as ai a lot of cutting edge ai has filtered into general applications often without being called ai because once something becomes useful enough and common enough its not labeled ai anymore various subfields of ai research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools the traditional goals of ai research include learning reasoning knowledge representation planning natural language processing perception and support for robotics to reach these goals ai researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques including search and mathematical optimization formal logic artificial neural networks and methods based on statistics operations research and economics ai also draws upon psychology linguistics philosophy neuroscience and other fields some companies such as openai google deepmind and meta aim to create artificial general intelligence agiai that can complete virtually any cognitive task at least as well as a human artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956 and the field went through multiple cycles of optimism throughout its history followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding known as ai winters funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when graphics processing units started being used to accelerate neural networks and deep learning outperformed previous ai techniques this growth accelerated further after 2017 with the transformer architecture in the 2020s an ongoing period of rapid progress in advanced generative ai became known as the ai boom generative ais ability to create and modify content has led to several unintended consequences and harms which has raised ethical concerns about ais longterm effects and potential existential risks prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology goals the general problem of simulating or creating intelligence has been broken into subproblems these consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display the traits described below have received the most attention and cover the scope of ai research reasoning and problemsolving early researchers developed algorithms that imitated stepbystep reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions by the late 1980s and 1990s methods were developed for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information employing concepts from probability and economics many of these algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experience a combinatorial explosion they become exponentially slower as the problems grow even humans rarely use the stepbystep deduction that early ai research could model they solve most of their problems using fast intuitive judgments accurate and efficient reasoning is an unsolved problem knowledge representation knowledge representation and knowledge engineering allow ai programs to answer questions intelligently and make deductions about realworld facts formal knowledge representations are used in contentbased indexing and retrieval scene interpretation clinical decision support knowledge discovery mining interesting and actionable inferences from large databases and other areas a knowledge base is a body of knowledge represented in a form that can be used by a program an ontology is the set of objects relations concepts and properties used by a particular domain of knowledge knowledge bases need to represent things such as objects properties categories and relations between objects situations events states and time causes and effects knowledge about knowledge what we know about what other people know default reasoning things that humans assume are true until they are told differently and will remain true even when other facts are changing and many other aspects and domains of knowledge among the most difficult problems in knowledge representation are the breadth of commonsense knowledge the set of atomic facts that the average person knows is enormous and the subsymbolic form of most commonsense knowledge much of what people know is not represented as facts or statements that they could express verbally there is also the difficulty of knowledge acquisition the problem of obtaining knowledge for ai applications planning and decisionmaking an agent is anything that perceives and takes actions in the world a rational agent has goals or preferences and takes actions to make them happen in automated planning the agent has a specific goal in automated decisionmaking the agent has preferencesthere are some situations it would prefer to be in and some situations it is trying to avoid the decisionmaking agent assigns a number to each situation called the utility that measures how much the agent prefers it for each possible action it can calculate the expected utility the utility of all possible outcomes of the action weighted by the probability that the outcome will occur it can then choose the action with the maximum expected utility in classical planning the agent knows exactly what the effect of any action will be in most realworld problems however the agent may not be certain about the situation they are in it is unknown or unobservable and it may not know for certain what will happen after each possible action it is not deterministic it must choose an action by making a probabilistic guess and then reassess the situation to see if the action worked in some problems the agents preferences may be uncertain especially if there are other agents or humans involved these can be learned eg with inverse reinforcement learning or the agent can seek information to improve its preferences information value theory can be used to weigh the value of exploratory or experimental actions the space of possible future actions and situations is typically intractably large so the agents must take actions and evaluate situations while being uncertain of what the outcome will be a markov decision process has a transition model that describes the probability that a particular action will change the state in a particular way and a reward function that supplies the utility of each state and the cost of each action a policy associates a decision with each possible state the policy could be calculated eg by iteration be heuristic or it can be learned game theory describes the rational behavior of multiple interacting agents and is used in ai programs that make decisions that involve other agents learning machine learning is the study of programs that can improve their performance on a given task automatically it has been a part of ai from the beginning there are several kinds of machine learning unsupervised learning analyzes a stream of data and finds patterns and makes predictions without any other guidance supervised learning requires labeling the training data with the expected answers and comes in two main varieties classification where the program must learn to predict what category the input belongs in and regression where the program must deduce a numeric function based on numeric input in reinforcement learning the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones the agent learns to choose responses that are classified as good transfer learning is when the knowledge gained from one problem is applied to a new problem deep learning is a type of machine learning that runs inputs through biologically inspired artificial neural networks for all of these types of learning computational learning theory can assess learners by computational complexity by sample complexity how much data is required or by other notions of optimization natural language processing natural language processing nlp allows programs to read write and communicate in human languages specific problems include speech recognition speech synthesis machine translation information extraction information retrieval and question answering early work based on noam chomskys generative grammar and semantic networks had difficulty with wordsense disambiguation unless restricted to small domains called microworlds due to the common sense knowledge problem margaret masterman believed that it was meaning and not grammar that was the key to understanding languages and that thesauri and not dictionaries should be the basis of computational language structure modern deep learning techniques for nlp include word embedding representing words typically as vectors encoding their meaning transformers a deep learning architecture using an attention mechanism and others in 2019 generative pretrained transformer or gpt language models began to generate coherent text and by 2023 these models were able to get humanlevel scores on the bar exam sat test gre test and many other realworld applications perception machine perception is the ability to use input from sensors such as cameras microphones wireless signals active lidar sonar radar and tactile sensors to deduce aspects of the world computer vision is the ability to analyze visual input the field includes speech recognition image classification facial recognition object recognition object tracking and robotic perception social intelligence affective computing is a field that comprises systems that recognize interpret process or simulate human feeling emotion and mood for example some virtual assistants are programmed to speak conversationally or even to banter humorously it makes them appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction or to otherwise facilitate humancomputer interaction however this tends to give nave users an unrealistic conception of the intelligence of existing computer agents moderate successes related to affective computing include textual sentiment analysis and more recently multimodal sentiment analysis wherein ai classifies the effects displayed by a videotaped subject general intelligence a machine with artificial general intelligence would be able to solve a wide variety of problems with breadth and versatility similar to human intelligence techniques ai research uses a wide variety of techniques to accomplish the goals above search and optimization ai can solve many problems by intelligently searching through many possible solutions there are two very different kinds of search used in ai state space search and local search state space search state space search searches through a tree of possible states to try to find a goal state for example planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals attempting to find a path to a target goal a process called meansends analysis simple exhaustive searches are rarely sufficient for most realworld problems the search space the number of places to search quickly grows to astronomical numbers the result is a search that is too slow or never completes heuristics or rules of thumb can help prioritize choices that are more likely to reach a goal adversarial search is used for gameplaying programs such as chess or go it searches through a tree of possible moves and countermoves looking for a winning position local search local search uses mathematical optimization to find a solution to a problem it begins with some form of guess and refines it incrementally gradient descent is a type of local search that optimizes a set of numerical parameters by incrementally adjusting them to minimize a loss function variants of gradient descent are commonly used to train neural networks through the backpropagation algorithm another type of local search is evolutionary computation which aims to iteratively improve a set of candidate solutions by mutating and recombining them selecting only the fittest to survive each generation distributed search processes can coordinate via swarm intelligence algorithms two popular swarm algorithms used in search are particle swarm optimization inspired by bird flocking and ant colony optimization inspired by ant trails logic formal logic is used for reasoning and knowledge representation formal logic comes in two main forms propositional logic which operates on statements that are true or false and uses logical connectives such as and or not and implies and predicate logic which also operates on objects predicates and relations and uses quantifiers such as every x is a y and there are some xs that are ys deductive reasoning in logic is the process of proving a new statement conclusion from other statements that are given and assumed to be true the premises proofs can be structured as proof trees in which nodes are labelled by sentences and children nodes are connected to parent nodes by inference rules given a problem and a set of premises problemsolving reduces to searching for a proof tree whose root node is labelled by a solution of the problem and whose leaf nodes are labelled by premises or axioms in the case of horn clauses problemsolving search can be performed by reasoning forwards from the premises or backwards from the problem in the more general case of the clausal form of firstorder logic resolution is a single axiomfree rule of inference in which a problem is solved by proving a contradiction from premises that include the negation of the problem to be solved inference in both horn clause logic and firstorder logic is undecidable and therefore intractable however backward reasoning with horn clauses which underpins computation in the logic programming language prolog is turing complete moreover its efficiency is competitive with computation in other symbolic programming languages fuzzy logic assigns a degree of truth between 0 and 1 it can therefore handle propositions that are vague and partially true nonmonotonic logics including logic programming with negation as failure are designed to handle default reasoning other specialized versions of logic have been developed to describe many complex domains probabilistic methods for uncertain reasoning many problems in ai including reasoning planning learning perception and robotics require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information ai researchers have devised a number of tools to solve these problems using methods from probability theory and economics precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan using decision theory decision analysis and information value theory these tools include models such as markov decision processes dynamic decision networks game theory and mechanism design bayesian networks are a tool that can be used for reasoning using the bayesian inference algorithm learning using the expectationmaximization algorithm planning using decision networks and perception using dynamic bayesian networks probabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering prediction smoothing and finding explanations for streams of data thus helping perception systems analyze processes that occur over time eg hidden markov models or kalman filters classifiers and statistical learning methods the simplest ai applications can be divided into two types classifiers eg if shiny then diamond on one hand and controllers eg if diamond then pick up on the other hand classifiers are functions that use pattern matching to determine the closest match they can be finetuned based on chosen examples using supervised learning each pattern also called an observation is labeled with a certain predefined class all the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set when a new observation is received that observation is classified based on previous experience there are many kinds of classifiers in use the decision tree is the simplest and most widely used symbolic machine learning algorithm knearest neighbor algorithm was the most widely used analogical ai until the mid1990s and kernel methods such as the support vector machine svm displaced knearest neighbor in the 1990s the naive bayes classifier is reportedly the most widely used learner at google due in part to its scalability neural networks are also used as classifiers artificial neural networks an artificial neural network is based on a collection of nodes also known as artificial neurons which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain it is trained to recognise patterns once trained it can recognise those patterns in fresh data there is an input at least one hidden layer of nodes and an output each node applies a function and once the weight crosses its specified threshold the data is transmitted to the next layer a network is typically called a deep neural network if it has at least 2 hidden layers learning algorithms for neural networks use local search to choose the weights that will get the right output for each input during training the most common training technique is the backpropagation algorithm neural networks learn to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs and find patterns in data in theory a neural network can learn any function in feedforward neural networks the signal passes in only one direction the term perceptron typically refers to a singlelayer neural network in contrast deep learning uses many layers recurrent neural networks rnns feed the output signal back into the input which allows shortterm memories of previous input events long shortterm memory networks lstms are recurrent neural networks that better preserve longterm dependencies and are less sensitive to the vanishing gradient problem convolutional neural networks cnns use layers of kernels to more efficiently process local patterns this local processing is especially important in image processing where the early cnn layers typically identify simple local patterns such as edges and curves with subsequent layers detecting more complex patterns like textures and eventually whole objects deep learning deep learning uses several layers of neurons between the networks inputs and outputs the multiple layers can progressively extract higherlevel features from the raw input for example in image processing lower layers may identify edges while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits letters or faces deep learning has profoundly improved the performance of programs in many important subfields of artificial intelligence including computer vision speech recognition natural language processing image classification and others the reason that deep learning performs so well in so many applications is not known as of 2021 the sudden success of deep learning in 20122015 did not occur b"
