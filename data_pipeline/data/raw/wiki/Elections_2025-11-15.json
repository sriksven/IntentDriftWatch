    "an election is a formal group decisionmaking process whereby a portion or all of a population or group votes to chooses an individual or multiple individuals to hold public office or other position of responsibility elections have been the usual mechanism by which modern representative democracy has operated since the 17th century elections may fill offices in the legislature sometimes in the executive and judiciary and for regional and local government such as cities or towns this process is also used in many other standardized associations public businesses and organizations from clubs to voluntary association and corporations the global use of elections as a tool for selecting representatives in modern representative democracies is in contrast with the practice in the democratic archetype ancient athens where the elections were considered an oligarchic institution and most political offices were filled using allotment which is also known as sortition by which office holders were chosen by lot electoral reform describes the process of introducing fair electoral systems where they are not in place or improving the fairness or effectiveness of existing systems psephology is the study of results and other statistics relating to elections especially with a view to predicting future results the term elect means to select or to nominate so sometimes other forms of balloting such as referendums are referred to as elections especially in the united states history elections were used as early in history as ancient greece and ancient rome and throughout the medieval period to select rulers such as the holy roman emperor see imperial election and the pope see papal election the pala king gopala ruled c 750s 770s ce in early medieval bengal was elected by a group of feudal chieftains such elections were quite common in contemporary societies of the region in the chola empire around 920 ce in uthiramerur in presentday tamil nadu palm leaves were used for selecting the village committee members the leaves with candidate names written on them were put inside a mud pot to select the committee members a young boy was asked to take out as many leaves as the number of positions available this was known as the kudavolai system the first recorded popular elections of officials to public office by majority vote where all citizens were eligible both to vote and to hold public office date back to the ephors of sparta in 754 bc under the mixed government of the spartan constitution athenian democratic elections where all citizens could hold public office were not introduced for another 247 years until the reforms of cleisthenes under the earlier solonian constitution c 574 bc all athenian citizens were eligible to vote in the popular assemblies on matters of law and policy and as jurors but only the three highest classes of citizens could vote in elections nor were the lowest of the four classes of athenian citizens as defined by the extent of their wealth and property rather than by birth eligible to hold public office through the reforms of solon the spartan election of the ephors therefore also predates the reforms of solon in athens by approximately 180 years questions of suffrage especially suffrage for minority groups have dominated the history of elections males the dominant cultural group in north america and europe often dominated the electorate and continue to do so in many countries early elections in countries such as the united kingdom and the united states were dominated by landed or ruling class males by 1920 all western european and north american democracies had universal adult male suffrage except switzerland and many countries began to consider womens suffrage despite legally mandated universal suffrage for adult males political barriers were sometimes erected to prevent fair access to elections see civil rights movement contexts elections are held in a variety of political organizational and corporate settings many countries hold elections to select people to serve in their governments but other types of organizations hold elections as well for example many corporations hold elections among shareholders to select a board of directors and these elections may be mandated by corporate law in many places an election to the government is usually a competition among people who have already won a primary election within a political party elections within corporations and other organizations often use procedures and rules that are similar to those of governmental elections electorate suffrage the question of who may vote is a central issue in elections the electorate does not generally include the entire population for example many countries prohibit those who are under the age of majority from voting all jurisdictions require a minimum age for voting in australia aboriginal people were not given the right to vote until 1962 see 1967 referendum entry and in 2010 the federal government removed the rights of prisoners serving for three years or more to vote a large proportion of whom were aboriginal australians suffrage is typically only for citizens of the country though further limits may be imposed in the european union one can vote in municipal elections if one lives in the municipality and is an eu citizen the nationality of the country of residence is not required in some countries voting is required by law eligible voters may be subject to punitive measures such as a fine for not casting a vote in western australia the penalty for a first time offender failing to vote is a 2000 fine which increases to 5000 if the offender refused to vote prior voting population historically the size of eligible voters the electorate was small due to the size of groups or communities and to the limited number privileged to vote like aristocrats and men of a city citizens with more people having bourgeois citizen rights outside of cities expanding the term citizen the electorates grew to numbers beyond the thousands elections with an electorate in the hundred thousands appeared in the final decades of the roman republic by extending voting rights to citizens outside of rome with the lex julia of 90 bc reaching an electorate of 910000 and estimated voter turnout of maximum 10 in 70 bc only again comparable in size to the first elections of the united states at the same time the kingdom of great britain had in 1780 about 214000 eligible voters 3 of the whole population naturalization can reshape the electorate of a country candidates a representative democracy requires a procedure to govern nomination for political office in many cases nomination for office is mediated through preselection processes in organized political parties nonpartisan systems tend to be different from partisan systems as concerns nominations in a direct democracy one type of nonpartisan democracy any eligible person can be nominated although elections were used in ancient athens in rome and in the selection of popes and holy roman emperors the origins of elections in the contemporary world lie in the gradual emergence of representative government in europe and north america beginning in the 17th century in some systems no nominations take place at all with voters free to choose any person at the time of votingwith some possible exceptions such as through a minimum age requirementin the jurisdiction in such cases it is not required or even possible that the members of the electorate be familiar with all of the eligible persons though such systems may involve indirect elections at larger geographic levels to ensure that some firsthand familiarity among potential electees can exist at these levels ie among the elected delegates systems in a democracy the members of the government are elected by a portion of the people who vote in an election elections are a way for an electorate to elect that is choose from several different candidates many countries in the world see an elections fought principally between two opposing parties these two will be the most established and most popular parties in the country for example in the us the competition is between the republicans and the democrats o in an indirect democracy voting is the method by which the person elected in charge represents the people whilst making decisions direct democracy is the complete opposite the people make the policy decisions directly without selecting a representative to do it for them a majority vote is when more than half of voters vote for the same person or party however whilst it is usually said each individuals vote does count many countries use a combination of factors to decide who has power not the atlarge popular vote most influential of these factors are districts that divide the electorate for example in the uk a party winning plurality in a majority of constituencies wins majority government but they may not always have the most individual votes ie they may have lose the popular vote but still win the seat count it is also possible for a party to win plurality in a minority of constituencies but more than any other one party and thus win minority government electoral systems are the detailed constitutional arrangements and voting systems that convert the vote into a political decision the first step is for voters to cast the ballots which may be simple singlechoice ballots but other types such as multiple choice or ranked ballots may also be used then the votes are tallied for which various vote counting systems may be used and the voting system then determines the result on the basis of the tally most systems can be categorized as either proportional majoritarian or mixed among the proportional systems the most commonly used are partylist proportional representation list pr systems among majoritarian are firstpastthepost electoral system single winner plurality voting and different methods of majority voting such as the widely used tworound system mixed systems combine elements of both proportional and majoritarian methods with some typically producing results closer to the former mixedmember proportional or the other eg parallel voting many countries have growing electoral reform movements which advocate systems such as approval voting single transferable vote instant runoff voting or a condorcet method these methods are also gaining popularity for lesser elections in some countries where more important elections still use more traditional counting methods while openness and accountability are usually considered cornerstones of a democratic system the act of casting a vote and the content of a voters ballot are usually an important exception the secret ballot is a relatively modern development but it is now considered crucial in most free and fair elections as it limits the effectiveness of intimidation electoral systems there are many electoral methods the purpose of an election may be to choose one person such as a president or a group such as a committee or a parliament in electing a parliament either each of many small constituencies can elect a single representative as in britain or each of a lesser number of multimember constituencies may elect two or more representatives as in ireland or multimember districts and some singlemember districts can be used or the entire country can be treated as one atlarge district as in the netherlands different voting systems require different levels of support to be elected plurality voting firstpastthepost voting elects the candidate with more votes than any other single candidate it does not require the winner to achieve a voting majority to have more than half of the total votes cast in firstpastthepost voting when more than two candidates run the winner commonly has less than half of the vote as few as 18 percent was recorded in 2014 in toronto in instantrunoff voting a candidate must have a majority of votes to be elected although presence of exhausted votes may mean that the majority at time of final count is not majority of votes cast in stv any candidate who takes quota usually set at much less than half of the votes is elected others without quota but with more votes than any other single candidate may be declared elected as well side effects of firstpastthepost voting include a waste of votes due to vote splitting a twoparty system and political polarization due to electing candidates that do not support centrism to understand why a race using firstpastthepost voting tends to favor lesscentric candidates consider a simple lab experiment where students in a class vote for their favorite marble if five marbles are assigned names and are placed up for election and if three of them are green one is red and one is blue then a green marble will rarely win the election the reason for the greens lack of success is vote splitting the three green marbles will split the votes of those who prefer green in fact in this analogy the only way that a green marble is likely to win is if more than threefifths of the voters prefer green if the same number of people prefer green as those who prefer red and blue that is to say if onethird of the voters prefer green onethird prefer blue and onethird prefer red then each green marble will only get oneninth of the vote if the green marbles each take same number of votes while the red and blue marbles will each get onethird putting the green marbles at a serious disadvantage if the experiment is repeated with other colors the color that is in the majority if the majority is split among multiple choices will still rarely win in other words from a purely mathematical perspective a singlewinner system tends to favor a winner that is different from the majority if the majority runs multiple candidates and if the minority group runs just one candidate this minority rule success can also result if multiple winners are elected and voters cast multiple votes plurality block voting but even if the majority is split among multiple candidates proportionate results can still be produced if votes can be transferred as under stv or if multiple winners are elected and each voter has just one vote alternatives to firstpastthepost voting include approval voting tworound proportional representation and instantrunoff voting with approval voting voters are encouraged to vote for as many candidates as they approve of so the winner is much more likely to be any one of the five marbles because people who prefer green will be able to vote for every one of the green marbles with tworound elections the field of candidates is thinned prior to the second round of voting in most cases the winner must receive a majority of the votes which is more than half if no candidate obtains a majority in the first round then the two candidates with the most significant plurality run again for the second round of voting variants exist regarding these two points the requirement for being elected at the first round is sometimes less than 50 and the rules for participation in the runoff may vary instantrunoff voting and stv uses single ranked votes block voting are often used for atlarge positions such as members of a city council in a voting system that uses multiple votes plurality block voting the voter can vote for a multiplemember subset of the running candidates so a voter might vote for alice bob and charlie rejecting daniel and emily approval voting uses such multiple votes in irv if no single candidate has 50 of the vote then the candidate with the fewest votes is excluded and their votes are redistributed according to the voters nominated order of preference the process repeats itself until a candidate has 50 or more votes the system is designed to produce the same result as an exhaustive ballot but using only a single round of voting under stv ranked voting is also used in a pr format prstv is used in australia ireland and malta voters rank candidates to provide backup preferences quota is calculated in say a fourseat constituency quota if droop quota is used is 20 percent of the valid vote plus 1 every candidate with quota of 1st preferences alone or combination of first preferences and later preferences will be elected if a candidate has more than a quota and seats are yet to be filled hisher surplus will be distributed to other candidates in proportion to the candidates next usable preferences marked on the vote if any if there are still candidates to be elected and no surplus votes to be transferred the leastpopular candidate is eliminated as above in av or irv and the process continues until four candidates have reached a quota or are declared elected when the field of candidates is thinned to the number of remaining open seats in the quota borda system qbs the voters also cast their preferences 1234 as they wish in the analysis all 1st preferences are counted all 2nd preferences are counted after these preferences have been translated into points per the rules of a modified borda count mbc the candidates points are also counted seats are awarded to any candidates with a quota of 1st preferences to any pair of candidates with two quotas of 1st2nd preferences and if seats are still to be filled to those candidates with the highest mbc scores in a voting system that uses a ranked vote the voter ranks the candidates in order of preference for example they might mark a preference for bob in the first place then emily then alice then daniel and finally charlie ranked voting systems such as those used in australia and ireland use a ranked vote in a voting system that uses a scored vote or range vote the voter gives each alternative a number between one and ten the upper and lower bounds may vary see cardinal voting systems some multiplewinner systems such as the single nontransferable vote sntv used in afghanistan and vanuatu give a single vote or one vote per elector even though multiple members are being elected in the district the condorcet rule is used sometimes in decisionmaking the voters or elected representatives cast their preferences on one some or all options 1234 as in prstv or qbs in the analysis option a is compared to option b and if a is more popular than b then a wins this pairing next a is compared with option c then d and so on likewise b is compared with c d etc the option which wins the most pairings if there is one is the condorcet winner campaigns when elections are called politicians and their supporters attempt to influence policy by competing directly for the votes of constituents in what are called campaigns supporters for a campaign can be either formally organized or loosely affiliated and frequently utilize campaign advertising it is common for political scientists to attempt to predict elections via political forecasting methods the most expensive election campaign included us7 billion spent on the 2012 united states presidential election and is followed by the us5 billion spent on the 2014 indian general election timing the nature of democracy is that elected officials are accountable to the people and they must return to the voters at prescribed intervals to seek their mandate to continue in office for that reason most democratic constitutions provide that elections are held at fixed regular intervals in the united states elections for public offices are typically held between every two and six years in most states and at the federal level with exceptions for elected judic"
