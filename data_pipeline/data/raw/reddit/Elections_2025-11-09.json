    "the life and times of octavia e butler 2025 in these times link the life and times of octavia e butler in a new biography susana m morris reflects on the devolution of american empire through the lens of butlers life by aina marzia 20251009 art by rachel k dooleyphotos by malcolm aliwire image leo alexander the summer before susana m morris turned 16 an age when she wasnt quite grown but not a kid anymore either she read octavia butlers 1993 novel parable of the sower first encountering the black teenage girl at its center as an adult reckoning with americas political climate morris describes trumps encouragement of violence against journalists and detractors as something right out of the 1998 sequel parable of the talents now a scholar of black feminism at georgia tech morris has taught the novel countless times noting that nearly every student reacts with the same question how did octavia know new admirers of butlers work might otherwise struggle to imagine the butler who faced rejection letters and once pawned her typewriter to pay bills before catching her big break years later in morris new biography positive obsession the life and times of octavia e butler she tries to answer that question tracing butlers life from the young introvert sometimes described as a kind of misanthrope who preferred her own company to her posthumous legacy as a literary mastermind whose oeuvre has become a centerpiece of black liberation for morris the biography also works as a dedication to blackness and an opportunity to understand her own existence as a black queer woman in the united states we learn about butlers writing from childhood in postwar pasadena calif through the black power movement and the reagan administration and into her last moments at age 58 in 2006 shadowed by the iraq war and war on terror butlers early awareness of power structures shifted her mindset into one that wondered whether those who didnt have much power could empower themselves and others and change the world morris describes how many adults attempted to discourage a young butler from pursuing a writing career and how she became known as a news junkie as early as age 13 fed by the 1960 election of president john f kennedy details from butlers upbringing manifest throughout her frequently dystopian work which routinely envisioned futures with black women at the center changing the course of human life and culture a 1951 fire that burned her grandmothers house is a mirror to the drug addicted pyros who enjoy lighting and watching fires that consume neighborhoods in parable of the sower in kindred a slave narrative that incorporates time travel butler hints at her mothers upbringing on a southern plantation asking us to reassess the legacy of american slavery wild seed an unapologetically weird novel and the fourth in the patternist series asks what it means to be human while kindred and her other novels speak to a mother and feminine black existence one that could hold the fate of humanity within it in the pantheon of literary icons positive obsession places butler alongside a museum of literary icons including audre lorde toni morrison and alice walker writers who like butler took on patriarchy white supremacy and other structures of power in dynamic ways that centered black womens experiences and intellectual contributions the title comes from an article butler wrote for essence in 1989 i was writing science fiction and fantasy for gods sake at that time nearly all professional science fiction writers were white men as much as i loved science fiction and fantasy what was i doing well whatever it was i couldnt stop positive obsession is about not being able to stop just because youre afraid and full of doubts positive obsession is dangerous its about not being able to stop at all whats special about the book is how closely it sits with butler in the throes of her obsession as she clanks away at her remington typewriter during time snatched from jobs in factories and laundries in the 1971 short story crossover she writes about a woman who is brought to the brink of insanity as she works in a factory new admirers of butlers work might otherwise struggle to imagine the butler who faced rejection letters and once pawned her typewriter to pay bills before catching her big break years later as an introvert and avid reader butlers young mind became a dreamscape other inspirations include for example her local library and grocerystore science fiction magazines we learn the telepathic humans from the patternist series for example were influenced by zenna hendersons 1961 novel pilgrimage which featured similar strong women characters and an alien telepathic force that spoke up about their unique struggles we also get notes from butlers journals and diaries which butler sometimes wrote in spanish or code to speak freely they frequently share butlers early interest in utopian societies as she wondered whether socialist or communist models could come to fruition as people will not live together without taking advantage of each other if they possibly can they will not stop considering themselves better because their skin is light the same journals reveal how butler was known by estelle her middle name in childhood since she and her mother share the name octavia and how she grappled with the weight of poverty isolation and frustration early in her career morris shows how butlers early financial struggles led her to publish the book survivor despite being a commentary on settler colonialism butler reveals that she regretted hastily accepting editors changes and publishing something that felt to her like bad writing positive obsession eloquently tells the story of octavia the trailblazer who simply wanted to write the kinds of work she wanted to read and for morris it works as an opportunity to reconnect with that young teenager first encountering a black girl hero in a book",

20th century intellectuals in the tapestry of modern islamic thought few figures shine as brightly as muhammad iqbal the philosopherpoet whose voice echoed far beyond the borders of british india to the people of pakistan he is the thinker who dreamed the dream of nationhood to the wider muslim world he is a spiritual revolutionary a poet of awakening who called upon the muslim ummah to rediscover its historical unity pride and divine purpose iqbal 18771938 was a poet philosopher politician and visionary thinker widely regarded as the spiritual founder of pakistan and one of the most influential muslim intellectuals of the 20th century known as allama iqbal the learned iqbal in south asia he wrote in persian and urdu blending islamic mysticism western philosophy and political activism early life he was born on november 9 1877 in sialkot punjab british india now pakistan into a devout kashmiri brahmin family that had converted to islam generations earlier iqbal excelled in arabic persian and urdu from childhood and went onto earn a ba and ma in philosophy from government college lahore from 1905 to 1908 he traveled to europe he studied at trinity college cambridge

offering the first intellectual articulation of the twonation theory though he did not use the word pakistan he laid its ideological foundation i would like to see the punjab northwest frontier province sindh and balochistan amalgamated into a single state the allahabad address laid down the philosophical blueprint for a separate homeland for the muslims of india but this dream was never meant to be geographical alone it was rooted in dignity selfrealization and spiritual sovereignty nations are born in the hearts of poets they prosper and die in the hands of politicians he once wrote reminding the world that ideas give birth to nations long before borders are drawn on maps for iqbal the creation of pakistan was not merely a political objective it was like a laboratory for islamic renaissance a place where muslims could rediscover the power of khudi the self that stands tall before god and history in 1932 muhammad iqbal visited cordoba in spain where he prayed and penned his famous poem about the lament of the great umayyad mosque in the city in this poem iqbal reminded muslims that empires fall dynasties vanish but the light of islamic faith that built the great mosque of cordoba lives on beyond time a voice for the muslim ummah the power of iqbals message was that it was never confined to one land writing in both urdu and persian he reached audiences from tehran to istanbul from kabul to cairo in iran he is revered as iqbalelahori placed alongside classical persian greats his admiration for maulana jalaluddin rumi whom he called his spiritual guide allowed him to enter the hearts of those who cherished sufi thought at a time when the muslim world was fractured by colonialism and internal divisions iqbal spoke of panislamic unity not as a political alliance alone but as a spiritual awakening he envisioned a world where muslims regardless of borders and languages would remember they were part of a single caravan bound by faith and destiny we are waves of the same sea leaves of the same tree the walls between us are illusions let them fall free though this verse is a poetic interpretation of his philosophy rather than a literal translation it captures the essence of iqbals call for unity a unity of hearts of purpose and intellect the call for selfhood and action through his passionate and eloquent poetry iqbal warned against stagnation urging muslims to rise above despair and reclaim their forgotten legacy of leadership and learning his iconic lines remain a rallying cry khudi ko kar buland itna ke har taqdeer se pehle khuda bande se khud poochhe bata teri raza kya hai here iqbal challenges the believer to elevate their character and soul until even destiny seeks their permission it is a philosophy not of resignation but of empowerment a bold reminder that faith is not passive submission but an active journey toward excellence today statues of the revolutionary poet muhammad iqbal stand in tehran his poetry is recited in turkey roads are named after him in kabul and dhaka conferences in central asia celebrate his thought and in pakistan he is a national icon where his words are etched into textbooks hearts and national memory iqbal did not merely write poetry he ignited movements he did not merely speak of freedom he breathed soul into it he called upon muslims to rise not in anger but in awareness to build not just empires of land but empires of intellect morality and islamic unity the poet still speaks iqbal never saw the creation of pakistan he died of a throat illness on april 21 1938 in lahore and was buried near the badshahi mosque but his legacy outlived him recognised as pakistans national poet his birthday november 9 is a public holiday known as iqbal day his thought influenced the pakistan movement iranian revolution thinkers and global muslim reform the iqbal academy pakistan preserves his works streets universities and airports across pakistan iran and beyond bear his name in an age where the muslim world continues to face strife and fragmentation iqbals voice remains hauntingly relevant he reminds us that true liberation begins within that nations crumble when their spirit fades and that unity is not born of slogans but of shared islamic purpose and moral awakening as we look across the modern landscape of the muslim world iqbals message returns like a timeless echo lift your gaze o traveller of faith you were not made to walk with your head bowed the caravan of the ummah waits rise and take your place among the builders of destiny in 1922 the british government tried to tame the revolutionary poet by granting him a knighthood and granting him the title sir after being appointed a knight bachelor by king george v iqbal nevertheless continued his scathing criticism of colonial rule and continued his calls for an intellectual and political awakening amongst the muslims of india and far beyond therefore there is no doubt that in remembering muhammad iqbal we do more than just honour a poet we revive a vision for the muslim ummah",

    "is there a reason why we think zohran wont ratfuck us just like all the other dsa backed candidates whenever i point out zohrans mistakes like calling cuba and venezuela a dictatorship and his statement this last october 7th people are like duh obviously hes not going to usher in a revolution thats not why were supporting him that isnt our position stop being a wrecker i get frustrated by this because its not my position that the prozohran people believe zohran is going to overthrow capitalism or whatever rather my position is hes probably going to be like the other progressive candidates in the democratic party prop up the system and not actually make any meaningful change on the ground everyone already knows why bernie and aoc suck they both ended up supporting israel when it mattered the most less attention is given to ilhan omar and rashida tlaib also dsabacked candidates since october 7th theyve rightly been criticizing israel and zionism as a whole but they are not antiimperialists tlaib supported the uighur genocide narrative and voted to give weapons to ukraine and taiwan omar also voted to give weapons to ukraine and taiwan i wont go so far to say that they are not meaningfully different from the us foreign policy establishment but are siding with the us government on many issues outside of the middle east and even in the middle east they arent that great omar and tlaib both praised assad getting replaced by al qaeda in syria and omar has some weird stances on turkey its cool that they are against the very worst iterations of us foreign policy genocide but im not seeing a meaningful difference on everything outside of that so lets bring this back to zohran in 2020 zohran tweeted a news article that announced a maoist politician in india in local elections and said we need more of this so i believe he knows whats up which is why i was so disappointed in the venezuela and cuba dictatorship remarks he knows the history of those countries and how us aggression has crippled them i dont believe he doesnt know any better and even if youre a true believer in democratic socialism and reject the leninist one party model that cuba operates under why call venezuela a dictatorship there are still opposition parties in venezuela that are openly anti chavezmaduro all of this is only made worse by the fact that were now openly attacking venezuela zohrans statements help manufacture consent for that ive seen people say well he had to say that because he was asked the question he couldnt just say nothing did he though hes a politician he can say deflect and say something like however you feel about the maduro and diaz we must stand against the trump administrations illegal and inhumane attacks and embargos agaisnt these countries and ive also seen people say it was a strategic move how is this strategic zohran was so successful because he put forth a genuinely progressive image and was bucking the establishment the type of people who are antivenezuela and anticuba arent going to be persuaded to vote for him because of a statement like that and so you may say well hes the mayor of new york he has no control over foreign policy what matters is how he runs the city first hes still knowingly manufacturing consent even if he follows it up with the blockadestrikes on the boats are wrong which to his credit he did say second if hes willing to capitulate on something that doesnt matter why do we think hes going to hold the line on things that do matter like taking on the rich in nyc i have no doubt that zohran will be a better mayor than cuomo would have been but why do we think hes going to be our guy on the actual administration of nyc hes already walked back his statements about the nypd ill actually give him some leeway on this because the nypd is basically a gang and they will physically fuck with you if you come down too hard on them like they did with de blasio but given that and his lukewarm foreign policy statements i really dont think hes going to make nyc a substantially better place hes already schmoozing with the establishment and donors like alex soros and sure he has to work within the system but given all of this i am struggling to understand where this belief that hes actually going to deliver comes from because he said nice things to be clear i live in nyc voted for zohran and even canvassed for him while knowing all of this i do not have the infantile disorder i agree with lenin that we need to meet people where they are at his election is a positive thing overall because it gets more people into leftwing politics and were breaking new ground here all the major demsoc politicians have only been legislators now were going to see someone with actual administrative power to do things but i believe so many people here have way too much misplaced faith in him and we need to be more critical about what he does instead of just dismissing all criticisms of him as wrecker behavior what is fundamentally different about zohran compared to bernie aoc tlaib and omar that warrants all this support also he got married in dubai",

    "prophecy from 2016 eerily correct this popped up as a facebook memory from 2016 a text that sarcasticallysatirically described the fictional day in 2029 when president trump passed away its jarring for me to see how many of this can already be the speed with which it all happened as well and by then people thought he would be a single term fluke you risked our future for that dad yesterday on june 12th 2029 president donald trump two days short of his 83rd birthday died peacefully in the white house just five months after winning a fourth term vice president sarah palin was immediately sworn in as his successor the announcement has shaken the country to its core provoking a quiet period of contemplation about the trump years and what comes next america has changed in ways that few believed possible when he was first elected in 2016 trump offered what many americans wanted he projected himself as a strong man who would turn back the clock and restore the country to what he thought was the greatness of the past in the 1950s and 1960s workingclass men in particular overwhelmingly supported trumps perplexing promise to return their manufacturing jobs and their middleclass lives as though they faced no new competition from women minorities and other countries those who understood the dangers to democracy that a man like trump represented had assumed that our system of checks and balances would keep him from going too far but they were wrong once in power trump accumulated more power with each passing year relying in part on a fiercely partisan congress and a compliant supreme court which included the three new members hed appointed those who disagreed with him including the press were slowly silenced by lawsuits threats personal attacks and imprisonment trump came to power in one of the nations most bizarre presidential elections it featured two widely unpopular major party candidates and two smaller party candidates hillary clinton trumps main competitor was widely expected to win the election according to polls and pundits across the spectrum trump however shocked the political world winning with just 46 percent of the vote after voters either ignored the polls or thought their vote didnt matter once inaugurated trump quickly acted on the promises hed made during the campaign many of which were laid out in his first 100 days plan over time all taxes on the rich and corporations were eliminated while spending on the military was increased by a third the national debt exploded trade deals were torn up but instead of creating new manufacturing jobs it caused the loss of 5 million jobs dependent upon exports the cost of imported goods doubled and tripled with new tariffs and trade wars hundreds of walmarts and bargain stores were forced to close abortion was outlawed samesex marriage was criminalized coal mining and offshore drilling were dramatically increased while all support for renewable energy was halted to reduce burdensome regulations the clean air act and the clean water act were gutted and in just a few years americans once again saw smog clouds over its cities acid rain in places like maine and rising pollution in its rivers and shorelines all actions to respond to climate change were stopped nearly all gun laws were eliminated including the ban on militarystyle heavy and tactical weapons millions of children of illegal immigrants were sent back to the country of their parents origin even though they were born here many died trying to return while the nations food industry nearly collapsed from the lack of harvesters food prices skyrocketed immigration was sharply curtailed except for white european christians muslims were excluded altogether in an aging country many companies were forced to close because of a lack of employees nuclear weapons spread to 12 new countries including at least four in danger of being overtaken by extremists who have pledged to use those weapons to eliminate americas major cities reckless taunting and overreactions have engaged the country in five new wars since 2020 as trump promised the world fears america but most of that fear is felt by our former allies who increasingly see the us as an erratic unreliable and dangerous superpower the country is now deeply settled in a second great depression leading to more calls for a dictatorship the children of america have begun to ask some hard questions of their parents at kitchen tables across the country what did you do to stop the rise of trump they ask parents often deny voting for trump others offer sheepish explanations i never thought he would win all the polls had clinton winning i thought i was free to use my vote as a protest against the system but dad didnt you hear what trump was saying didnt you know that there was only one candidate who could have stopped him why didnt you vote for her dad im sorry sweetie i didnt like her very much but why well she used

    "wtf is wrong with the people of delhi like cmon when kejri was in power the opposition railed him down over environmental pollution and yamuna then bjp released its manifesto for delhi elections and nothing was mentioned in it with respect to solving the problem of pollution even though everyone knew that centre and states can better collaborate on this issue and solve this which cant be done by kejri alone with opposition from centre but even then the people of delhi voted for the bjp a party of many tactics which is now spraying water near aqi monitors suppressing news channels and print media from speaking on it all this anyone with basic common sense couldve predicted now everyone is out on streets like why your elected representative will solve the problem for which you elected him ignoring the other problems which you didnt consider that is how this all works",

    "getting congressional candidates that will work to solve problems we the american people need to do a better job of electing our representatives a big part of the problem is lack of good candidates i believe one of the reasons for this is that most american know they cant afford to be a member of congress here are my thoughts most members of congress senate and house earn about 175k per year while that is a good salary its not that good if you have to live in two places your home state and washington dc even a small apartment in dc is incredibly expensive and add to that daily living expenses the need for a professional wardrobe etc most americans cant afford it especially if they have a family back home with a mortgage to pay car loans saving for college tuition etc most members of congress are millionaires they either start that way and therefore can afford to do the job or become wealthy in congress due to investments they make on information they learn on the job we need more americans in congress who want to work to solve our many problems and have backgrounds or expertise that is important but wouldnt attempt to run because they know they cant afford to live in two places that is why i think four things are important 1 members of congress have access to a place to live while in dc like a small apartment 2 a stock investment ban is in place 3 campaign finance reform limiting the amount of that can be spent on a campaign and individual donations and 4 term limits i say 6 terms for 12 years thoughts",

    "bjp will be worse than tmc my personal thoughts as of now observing delhis situation i believe the bjp is worse than aap theyve just put up a puppet as cm in the form of rekha whos a lapdog to modi no one actually knew who would be cm before the elections and all they did was give the vote to oust aap now theyre corrupting the system too by sprinkling water and preventing people from protesting similarly we also dont know wholl be the chief minister in the bjp camp they dont have any sane leaders and expect us to vote in the name of modi and oust tmc every bjp party member was earlier a tmcian and they just flocked to the other side before the election or to earn personal benefits they have no liberal ideology nothing except theyll say dont eat nonveg and deploy bajrang dal to control couples tmc and bjp arent the same sides of a coin bjp is far worse delhi is a prime example",

    "why isnt omtatah a more popular choice for the presidency its true that historically kenyan elections have been determined by tribal leanings albeit its weight is diminishing year on year especially as the new generations come to maturity that aside omtatah is the only person so far ive really heard addressing national issues not just removing ruto his key points are 1 auditing the national debt and nullifying odious ones the biggest existential threat to the countrys sovereignty 2 removing the current model of the imperial presidency as he calls it one proposal is shifting the treasury from the executive to being an independent institution 3 strengthening government institutions and constitutionality iebc kebs judiciary kpa kenha parliament etc a nation with inclusive institutions instead of extractive ones will always prosper 4 full devolution of functions to the counties this way it wont matter who is in charge everybody would trust the system works for them instead of a few regions regardless of voting patterns 5 protection of public property and land not just privatising assets in the name of affordable housing kenya iheshimiwe 6 he has political experience as one of the most vocal and consistent senators in this parliament so we can see his track record plus as a private citizen hes always fighting for the little guy with incessant litigation against punitive policies and he lives a modest life with no corruption scandals he genuinely seems like the obvious choice in pushing kenya forward i know his weakness are 1 the aura argument hollow as it is 2 limited campaign capital which honestly should be a none issue as it incentives corrupt money to win 3 a forthright attitude which makes him difficult to join political coalitions with 4 backing of his community i pray kenya wakes up from its stockholm syndrome under the politicians that are sucking it dry we do have good politicians to choose from few as they are",
