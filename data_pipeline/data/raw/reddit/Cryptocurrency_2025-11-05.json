    "the ghost billionaire how a shy kid stole 34 billion and vanished for 9 years theres a moment that changes everything for james zhong that moment came on september 12 2012 sitting alone in his dorm room at the university of georgia staring at a computer screen that showed him something impossible he was 22 years old shy overweight bullied his entire life no friends to speak of his parents had divorced and barely acknowledged his existence hed retreated into the only world that made sense to him computers and code and on that september night poking around a website called silk road a hidden marketplace where people bought drugs and weapons using digital money called bitcoin he discovered something that would make him secretly richer than almost anyone on earth he found a glitch a beautiful terrible glitch the heist nobody noticed silk road was the amazon of crime you couldnt find it on google you needed special software to access it once inside you could buy anything illegal you wanted and you paid with bitcoin digital currency that was supposed to be anonymous and untraceable the site was run by someone called dread pirate roberts a mysterious figure who later turned out to be ross ulbricht a guy who believed in total freedom and ended up creating the worlds first major online criminal empire but silk road had a problem in its code when you tried to withdraw your bitcoin from your account there was a tiny window less than a second where the system got confused if you were fast enough you could submit multiple withdrawal requests before the system realized youd already taken your money out james discovered this by accident and then he discovered he could exploit it over and over again heres how simple it was hed deposit 500 bitcoin into his account then in less than one second hed hit the withdrawal button five times the system would process all five withdrawals before realizing it should only process one instead of getting his 500 bitcoin back hed get 2500 bitcoin five times what hed deposited it was like putting a dollar into a vending machine pressing the button five times really fast and getting five dollars in change except instead of dollars it was bitcoin and instead of doing it once james did it 140 times across nine different accounts over the course of a few days in september 2012 this shy college kid with no criminal record and no connections executed one of the most elegant thefts in history he never bought drugs never sold anything never interacted with anyone on silk road he just exploited the glitch drained 50000 bitcoin from the system and vanished at the time those 50000 bitcoin were worth about 620000 not bad for a few days of work but james didnt sell them he just waited the secret billionaire for nine years james zhong lived a double life that would make any spy movie jealous on the surface he was just a regular guy graduated college lived in gainesville georgia in a nice but not ostentatious house drove nice cars but not crazy ones to his neighbors he was quiet polite maybe a little odd nobody suspected anything but behind closed doors james was spending money like a saudi prince on vacation he bought multiple lamborghinis chartered private jets to fly to sporting events rented yachts spent hundreds of thousands of dollars at luxury hotels and private clubs went to nightclubs where bottle service cost more than most people make in a month bought real estate all told he burned through about 16 million in cash over those nine years living a secret life of absolute excess that nobody in his normal life knew about and heres the crazy part that 16 million was nothing it was pocket change because while he was spending that money the bitcoin hed stolen was sitting in digital wallets growing in value like some kind of financial monster by 2017 bitcoins price had exploded his 50000 bitcoin were now worth tens of millions of dollars by 2020 hundreds of millions by november 2021 when federal agents finally figured out who he was those same bitcoin were worth 336 billion james zhong the bullied kid who nobody loved whod retreated into computers because people were too cruel was secretly one of the richest people in america and absolutely nobody knew the mistake every perfect crime has one flaw every criminal makes one mistake for james that mistake came from the most human impulse imaginable he got robbed and he called the cops about it on march 13 2019 someone broke into jamess house and stole hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of cryptocurrency from him the irony is almost beautiful the guy who stole 3 billion got robbed and was mad enough about it to report the crime to police the local cops in athens georgia had no idea what to do with a cryptocurrency theft case they took his report poked around a bit but the investigation went nowhere james probably thought he was safe he wasnt that police report created a paper trail it put james zhongs name in a system connected to large amounts of cryptocurrency and federal investigators who were still working on silk roadrelated cases years after the site shut down noticed but the real mistake came later in september 2019 james needed to sell some bitcoin probably to fund more lamborghinis or yacht rentals so he transferred 118 bitcoin to a cryptocurrency exchange these exchanges are regulated which means they require real identification you cant just show up anonymously and trade millions of dollars in crypto when james made that transfer he did something catastrophically stupid he mixed bitcoin from different sources in the same transaction some of the bitcoin were from his stolen stash some were from legitimate sources but in the blockchain the permanent public ledger that records every bitcoin transaction ever made you could see that both sets of bitcoin came from the same person its like if a bank robber deposited stolen money and legitimate money in the same bank account at the same time the stolen money has serial numbers that police are tracking the legitimate money has the robbers name on it putting them together creates a direct link between the robber and the crime blockchain analysis companies exist specifically to catch mistakes like this a firm called chainalysis working with irs criminal investigation agents traced the bitcoin back through years of transactions through mixing services designed to obscure the money trail through wallet after wallet until they found the original source silk road and they found the person controlling those wallets james zhong the raid november 9 2021 federal agents showed up at jamess house in gainesville with a search warrant what they found was like something out of a movie james had tried to hide his bitcoin on multiple devices scattered throughout the house most of it was in an underground floor safe about as secure as you can get but federal agents are thorough and they didnt stop at the safe in the bathroom closet hidden under blankets they found a cheetos popcorn tin not a small one one of those big tins you get around christmas they opened it inside was a singleboard computer containing private keys to bitcoin wallets worth hundreds of millions of dollars the image of federal agents opening a popcorn tin and discovering enough cryptocurrency to buy a small country is almost too absurd to believe but its real court documents confirm it photos exist the agents seized approximately 50491 bitcoinat that moment worth 336 billion they also found 661900 in cash gold and silver bars and 25 special physical coins called casascius coins that contained private keys to another 174 bitcoin it was the secondlargest financial seizure in us department of justice history james cooperated immediately there was no point denying anything the evidence was overwhelming and the bitcoin were sitting right there in his house including in a literal snack food container over the following months he voluntarily transferred another 861 bitcoin to the government that hed hidden in other locations the trial that wasnt james zhong never went to trial there was no dramatic courtroom showdown no jury deliberation no lastminute perry mason moment he pled guilty to one count of wire fraud on november 4 2022 wire fraud is a federal crime that carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison and fines up to 250000 given that james had stolen 336 billion by the value at seizure and hidden it for nearly a decade while living a secret life of luxury youd think prosecutors would push for the maximum but jamess lawyers had a story to tell and it was genuinely tragic james was born to chinese immigrant parents who divorced when he was in high school according to court documents they showed him no love or parental concern he was severely bullied throughout childhood and adolescence because he was shy overweight and socially awkward nobody diagnosed it at the time but james had autism spectrum disorder he literally processed the world differently than other people which made social interaction painful and confusing he retreated into computers because computers made sense code was logical predictable it didnt mock you for being different and when he discovered that glitch in silk roads code it probably felt like the first time the universe had given him something instead of taking things away the prosecutors acknowledged all of this they also acknowledged that james had cooperated fully had helped them recover all the stolen bitcoin and had committed the theft when he was only 22 years old young isolated and probably not fully understanding the magnitude of what he was doing federal sentencing guidelines recommended 27 to 33 months in prison about 25 years judge paul gardephe looking at the unique circumstances of the case went even lower on april 14 2023 james zhong was sentenced to one year and one day in federal prison the judge made it clear he wasnt excusing the crime while the victim in this case happened to be a criminal enterprise the victim tomorrow could be a legitimate business but he also recognized that this wasnt a typical case james wasnt a hardened criminal he was a kid with autism who found a glitch exploited it and then spent nine years terrified that someone would discover his secret the fall james served his sentence and was released in april 2024 he walked out of federal prison into a life that bore no resemblance to the one hed had before the government had seized everything all the bitcoin all the cash the gold and silver the lamborghinis the real estate every asset hed accumulated through the theft was forfeited the 336 billion hed once controlled money that had appreciated from 620000 to an amount that could fund small nations was gone james zhong whod once chartered private jets and rented yachts whod spent money like water and lived a secret life of absurd luxury needed a job according to recent reports hes now driving for uber and lyft think about that from secretly being one of the richest people in america richer than most celebrities richer than successful tech entrepreneurs richer than people whod spent their entire lives building legitimate businesses to driving strangers around town for hourly wages plus tips its one of the most dramatic reversals of fortune in modern criminal history and its absolutely real what it all means theres something almost tragic about jamess story not sympathetic exactly he still stole money and lived a lie for nearly a decade but tragic in the greek sense where the protagonists fatal flaw leads inevitably to his downfall jamess flaw was isolation he didnt have friends whod question where his money came from he didnt have a family whod notice he was living beyond any legitimate means so all of us especially the fat lonely bullied ones dont try to do anything like him the blockchain remembers everything and eventually it tells",

aligning with industry standards soccer markets include asian handicaps and goal props prop bets extensive player and team props such as nba player points or mlb strikeouts the platforms locker room
