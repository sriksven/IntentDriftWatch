    "redmap the assault on democracy that entrenched gop power and made them unaccountable to voters most people think elections are lost at the ballot box but the real game was won years earlier on a map in 2010 the republican state leadership committee quietly launched a project called redmap the redistricting majority project its goal wasnt to win congress outright it was to win control of state legislatures just in time to redraw voting districts after the census for about 30 million they pulled off one of the most effective and least discussed power plays in modern us history by targeting lowprofile statehouse races in swing states like pennsylvania wisconsin michigan and north carolina the gop gained control over who drew the maps with new mapping software they locked in political dominance even when they lost the popular vote in 2012 democrats got more total votes nationwide for the us house yet republicans still walked away with a commanding majority in some states 50 of the votes translated into 70 of the seats that wasnt an accident it was redmap this strategy turned democracy into geometry and made accountability optional heres how it worked and why it still shapes american politics today 1 what is redmap redmap stands for the redistricting majority project launched by the republican state leadership committee rslc in 2010 to reshape electoral maps in favor of the gop the premise was simple but devastatingly effective he who controls redistricting can control congress rslc memo 2010 by focusing on state legislative control republicans could dictate congressional and state district boundaries after the 2010 census essentially deciding the next decade of elections before a single vote was cast source wikipedia redmap wbur 2 how it worked the gop identified key swing states where flipping just a few statehouse seats would hand them control of redistricting they flooded obscure state legislative races with cash and data support 107 targeted races across 16 states once in power they used sophisticated mapping software like maptitude to redraw districts with surgical precision packing democratic voters into a few districts and cracking others across many to dilute their influence example in pennsylvania 2012 democrats won 51 of the house vote but took only 5 of 18 seats source new yorker ratfked by david daley 3 the impact 2010 elections republicans gained nearly 700 state legislative seats flipping control in 20 chambers result in many states democrats could win the popular vote but still lose the majority of seats a textbook case of minority rule through map manipulation it cemented republican power in swing states for the entire 2010s even as demographic trends shifted leftward source wbur epi 4 why it matters maps last a decade once drawn they shape every election budget and law for ten years accountability dies when politicians pick their voters instead of voters picking them they can ignore public opinion and still win polarization grows safe seats reward extremism over compromise primary challengers become the real threat not general elections minority rule thrives a party representing fewer americans can still dominate legislatures and block popular reforms example north carolinas 2022 midterms gop won 60 of congressional seats with only 50 of votes 5 legal and political fallout rucho v common cause 2019 the supreme court ruled partisan gerrymandering is a political question outside federal court jurisdiction effectively legalizing redmaps tactics at the federal level some states fought back with independent redistricting commissions eg california michigan arizona but the effect is uneven nationwide the arms race continues both parties now use advanced mapping algorithms but redmap wrote the original playbook source scotusblog summary of rucho decision 6 the legacy of redmap even today the effects linger wisconsin despite democrats winning statewide races gop holds a nearsupermajority in the legislature ohio north carolina maps repeatedly struck down for violating state constitutions only to be redrawn similarly nationally redmap helped create a congress and state political landscape where policy outcomes often defy majority opinion as former rslc strategist chris jankowski bragged we did the math we drew the maps and we won source rolling stone inside the gops plan to control congress for the next decade 7 tldr redmap was a 30 million republican plan in 2010 to win state legislatures and draw congressional maps that guaranteed gop dominance for a decade even when they lost the popular vote its how democracy was quietly hacked one district at a time",

    "a blue wave is building what we learned from election night 25",
    "i have seen a vision of the future from november 2030 ask me anything ask me any 2030 election result and i will tell you what happened",
    "socialists with a big s need to realise most people have a different idea of what socialism is just reading all the discourse and controversy surrounding the new york election in the us it seems theres this odd disconnect with socialist activists and peoples general idea of what socialism and left wing politics is this is obviously heightened in america but it seems a lot of socialists and leftists with a big l are frustrated that the new mayor is really just another capitalist that all this celebrating is for nothing and is premature that the bourgeoisie will not allow any real socialism to come to the city and hes backed by capitalist billionaires himself being the leading democratic candidate rather than an independent but it seems most people who arent activists havent read lenins imperialism and dont really know what the bourgeoisie actually are just see the word socialism and the term left wing and being a more progressive politics within the current system politics that prioritise wealth inequality social programmes nationalisation of key industries over profit people over profit and even more strangely are big s socialists thinking this vote means theres a huge demand for big s socialism i think this is gonna be a problem with socialist movements trying to galvanise workers that wany better material conditions into actual socialism but if they cannot see this disconnect and get hung up on the liberal use of socialism and left wing theyre never gonna really get anywhere"
