    "the man who stole 45 billion partied with leonardo dicaprio and vanished into china let me tell you about the night britney spears jumped out of a cake to wish happy birthday to a man whod stolen billions of dollars from an entire country it was november 2012 las vegas a nightclub so exclusive you needed to be on a very specific guest list to even know it existed and there surrounded by hollywood alisters supermodels and the children of oil sheiks was jho low a softspoken slightly pudgy malaysian man who nobody had heard of five years earlier celebrating his 31st birthday while britney spears literally emerged from a giant cake singing to him leonardo dicaprio was there paris hilton was there kim kardashian was there they were all there because jho low had paid them to be there with money hed stolen from malaysias sovereign wealth fund while pretending to be developing his country and heres the thing that makes this story so perfectly darkly absurd at that exact moment jho low was financing a martin scorsese film called the wolf of wall street a movie about a corrupt stockbroker who steals millions and hides the money in foreign banks this is the story of how a nobody from malaysia became the worlds most successful financial criminal threw the most expensive parties in human history bought his way into hollywood and then disappeared into china where hes reportedly living under a fake identity as a greekaustralian businessman while working as a secret advisor to the chinese government and the craziest part is most of the money is still missing but lets start at the beginning the poor rich kid heres what you need to understand about jho low he wasnt poor his grandfather had built an empire in ironore mining liquor and real estate across thailand malaysia and hong kong his father sold a textile company for 15 million by any normal standard jho low was born into serious wealth but he wasnt born into enough wealth and that psychological wound that sense of being rich but not rich enough is what created the monster when jho lows parents sent him to harrow school in london the same boarding school that educated winston churchill and seven british prime ministers he found himself surrounded by kids whose families made his family look middleclass saudi princes children of russian oligarchs heirs to billiondollar fortunes that had existed for centuries and jho low the son of a successful malaysian textile manufacturer was suddenly at the bottom of the wealth hierarchy he had money but he was surrounded by people with unfathomable money money so vast it had its own gravity money that opened doors he couldnt even see thats where it started not in poverty not in desperation in relative deprivation in the psychological torture of being wealthy enough to see into the world of the superelite but not wealthy enough to truly belong there so he decided to steal his way in learning to buy people after harrow jho low made a calculated decision he didnt go to cambridge or oxford like most harrow graduates he went to wharton the university of pennsylvanias business school not because he cared about the education spoiler he never actually graduated but because wharton was where the worlds richest young people went to pretend they cared about learning business and jho low didnt go to wharton to study he went to wharton to network his classmates included the children of gulf princes saudi oil sheiks and heirs to multinational corporations and jho low softspoken awkward with women not particularly charismatic figured out something brilliant he couldnt compete with these people on inherited wealth or social pedigree but he could compete on throwing parties so thats what he did he rented out nightclubs in philadelphia spent tens of thousands of dollars per event made sure the guest lists included all the right people for his 20th birthday he dropped 40000 to rent shampoo one of philadelphias hottest clubs he invited ivanka trump on gambling trips to atlantic city he became obsessed with paris hilton and reportedly watched house of wax her movie over and over again he was buying his way into social circles he couldnt organically access and it worked because heres what jho low understood that most people dont rich people really rich people are deeply profoundly bored and the person who can cure that boredom who can make things happen who can get the best clubs and the best celebrities and the most exclusive experiences becomes valuable jho low made himself valuable not through talent or charm or intelligence through money specifically through spending more money than anyone else was willing to spend on making rich kids have fun and through those parties he met the people who would later help him steal billions he met riza aziz who happened to be the stepson of najib razak malaysias future prime minister he met yousef al otaiba a foreign policy advisor to uae sheikhs who introduced him to khaldoon khalifa al mubarak who ran mubadala development a sovereign wealth fund managing billions these werent random friendships these were strategic acquisitions jho low was collecting powerful people the way some people collect stamps and he was doing it by throwing the best parties anyone had ever seen the first lie heres a detail thats easy to miss but absolutely critical jho low never actually graduated from wharton he dropped out but for the rest of his career when meeting with bankers when pitching deals when building his reputation as an international financier he told everyone he had a wharton degree when joanna yu a relationship manager at ambank in malaysia first met jho low she believed hed graduated from wharton because low had provided her with a letter stating exactly that years later when lows lawyer revealed that low had never actually graduated yu was genuinely shocked this wasnt just resume padding this was the foundational lie that made everything else possible because when youre trying to convince people to give you access to billions of dollars wharton graduate carries weight it signals legitimacy intelligence connections it opens doors jho low understood that credentials arent about what you actually accomplished theyre about what people believe you accomplished and if you lie convincingly enough if you provide the right documentation if you never hesitate if you act like its obviously true people wont question it nobody checked nobody verified a missing diploma became a wharton education through the simple mechanism of saying it enough times that it became true the art of the namedrop after leaving wharton dropout status carefully concealed jho low returned to malaysia with a new identity international financier with connections to the worlds wealthiest families according to joanna yu who managed lows accounts at ambank lows conversational style was distinctive he would constantly mention that he was going to meet somebody from kuwait or reference conversations with the governor of bank negara malaysia or the prime minister of malaysia or prince turki alsaud of saudi arabia these werent casual mentions they were strategic deployments even if the conversations hadnt happened even if low had simply been in the same room as these people at some event the repetition created an aura of access think about how this works psychologically if someone mentions once that they know a prince you might be sceptical but if that same person casually references conversations with princes prime ministers governors and sheikhs across dozens of interactions your brain starts accepting it as background reality the sheer volume of namedropping becomes its own evidence jho low wasnt just lying he was constructing a persona through accumulation each tiny lie reinforced the previous lies until the whole structure felt solid enough to support billions of dollars in fraud 2009 the big score begins now we get to the actual crime and its important to understand that what jho low did was not a simple theft it was architecture he built elaborate financial structures specifically designed to make stealing look like investing in 2009 malaysias new prime minister najib razak whose stepson youll remember jho low had befriended at wharton created something called 1malaysia development berhad 1mdb for short it was supposed to be a sovereign wealth fund that would invest in development projects and make malaysia rich najib invited jho low to become involved as an advisor and thats when low saw his opportunity the petrosaudi scam august 2009 a yacht in monaco najib and low are meeting with representatives from petrosaudi international an oil drilling company theyre discussing a joint venture 1mdb would invest 1 billion into a partnership with petrosaudi acquiring 40 equity in a new company called 1mdb petrosaudi limited on paper it looked legitimate malaysias sovereign wealth fund partnering with an oil company to develop energy resources exactly the kind of thing sovereign wealth funds are supposed to do but heres what actually happened on september 30 2009 when that 1 billion was transferred 300 million went to the legitimate joint venture account at jpmorgan 700 million went to an account at rbs coutts bank in zurich belonging to a shell company called good star limited and who owned good star limited jho low personally when the banks compliance team asked who owned good star 1mdbs ceo falsely claimed it was owned by petrosaudi but it wasnt it was jho lows personal account hed just stolen 700 million in a single transaction by creating a fake company with a name that sounded official enough that nobody checked low didnt just wire money from 1mdb to himself he created corporate structures joint ventures investment agreements loan documents he made the theft look like business and business is so complicated involves so many parties and documents and jurisdictions that unravelling it requires forensic accountants working for years between may and october 2011 good star received another 330 million in transfers each one disguised as legitimate business transactions by the end low had personally stolen over 1 billion from malaysias sovereign wealth fund and almost nobody knew it was happening the goldman sachs connection by 2012 jho low had refined his operation he wasnt content stealing hundreds of millions he wanted billions and to do that he needed goldman sachs goldman sachs one of the most prestigious investment banks on earth with compliance systems and risk management and all the institutional safeguards designed to prevent exactly this kind of fraud agreed to underwrite three massive bond offerings for 1mdb between 2012 and 2013 total raised 65 billion goldmans fees nearly 600 million heres how it worked according to former goldman banker tim leissner who was later convicted and sentenced to prison for his role in 2012 jho low convened a meeting in his london apartment where he explicitly outlined which malaysian and uae officials would receive bribes to ensure goldman was selected as 1mdbs underwriter it wasnt subtle it wasnt hidden low literally explained the bribery structure to goldman bankers and they proceeded with the deal anyway billions from those bond offerings were then systematically diverted into offshore shell companies controlled by low and his associates the bonds were supposed to fund malaysian development projects power plants real estate infrastructure instead the money flowed through a web of shell companies in switzerland singapore and the cayman islands ultimately ending up in accounts low could access from just one of those bond transactions prosecutors allege low stole 14 billion goldman sachs eventually paid a 29 billion settlement to malaysia one of the largest wall street penalties in history but the settlement allowed goldman to avoid admitting wrongdoing which raises the obvious question how complicit was goldman sachs as an institution were leissner and roger ng another goldman banker who was convicted just rogue actors or did goldmans corporate culture enable the fraud we will probably never get a definitive answer but what we know for certain is that one of the worlds most sophisticated financial institutions facilitated the theft of billions of dollars and jho low made it possible by understanding something fundamental if you bribe the right people and make the paperwork complicated enough even goldman sachs will look the other way what did he do with 45 billion now heres where the story shifts from financial crime to pure unhinged excess because jho low didnt steal billions to hide them in swiss bank accounts and live quietly he stole billions to throw the most expensive parties in human history and buy his way into hollywood the leonardo dicaprio friendship jho low met leonardo dicaprio at a las vegas party in 2010 and what began as a casual acquaintance rapidly evolved into something much weirder low became dicaprios financier party sponsor and giftgiverinchief low financed massive parties in las vegas los angeles and on yachts in the mediterranean he invited alist celebrities alicia keys paris hilton britney spears kanye west kim kardashian he paid emily ratajkowski 25000 just to attend the super bowl with him he donated millions to dicaprios environmental foundation and he gave dicaprio absurdly expensive gifts a 32 million picasso painting a first edition of the great gatsby an academy award statuette that marlon brando won for on the waterfront think about what that last gift means low somehow acquired one of hollywoods most sacred objects an actual oscar won by one of historys greatest actors and gave it to dicaprio like it was a novelty item the federal government eventually seized it along with the picasso and the gatsby but the gesture reveals everything about lows psychology he was using stolen money to buy proximity to fame and proximity to fame as proof that hed finally transcended his origins the wolf of wall street this is where the story achieves perfect ironic symmetry through his connection with riza aziz the malaysian prime ministers stepson low cofounded red granite pictures and used embezzled 1mdb funds to finance hollywood films the most infamous martin scorseses 2013 film the wolf of wall street starring leonardo dicaprio the film is about jordan belfort a corrupt stockbroker who steals millions through securities fraud and attempts to hide his illgotten gains in foreign safe havens sound familiar according to court documents a 9 million advance was made to red granite for the wolf of wall street in september 2012 paid directly from accounts controlled by jho low using stolen 1mdb money and as a final flourish of audacity low personally thanked himself in the films closing credits he stole billions from malaysia used that money to finance a movie about stealing money and hiding it offshore and then thanked himself publicly for financing the movie while federal investigators were already beginning to trace his fraud the department of justice eventually seized royalties from three red granite productions the wolf of wall street daddys home and dumb and dumber to but by then the damage was done low had successfully purchased a place in hollywood history and the fact that hed done it with stolen money almost made the achievement more impressive to the people whod spent time with him the yacht the gambling the jewellery lets talk about the 250 million superyacht in 2014 low took delivery of the equanimity a 300foot floating palace with a gym an olympicsized swimming pool a private art gallery a beauty salon a helipad and sleeping quarters for 22 guests the running costs were approximately 500000 per month just to maintain when malaysian authorities finally seized it in 2018 and tried to auction it off to recover stolen funds they could only get 130 million 52 of its purchase price because even among billionaires there are only so many people willing to buy a yacht thats internationally famous as the product of massive financial fraud then there was the gambling court testimony from the venetian casino in las vegas revealed that low gambled approximately 87 million there over the years losing 26 million one particularly bad session saw him lose 175 million in 90 minutes playing baccarat casino executives described him as extremely extravagant making requests parallel to none including custom disco balls dance floors and dedicated djs and the jewellery low purchased a 129 million heartshaped diamond for model miranda kerr along with a 38 million diamond pendant she was eventually forced to surrender both to federal authorities he bought art by picasso warhol and monet worth collectively 35 million all of it eventually seized by governments trying to recover the stolen billions heres whats psychologically fascinating jho low wasnt hiding his wealth most criminals who steal billions try to hide the money live quietly avoid attention low did the opposite he threw parties that made international news he hung out with the most famous people on earth he bought yachts that appeared in magazines its like he needed the world to see that hed finally made it that he was no longer the kid at harrow who wasnt quite wealthy enough that hed transcended his origins through sheer force of spending and that compulsive display is exactly what allowed investigators to trace where the money went the political bribery heres a detail that got buried in all the yacht and dicaprio coverage according to court testimony jho low attempted to donate upwards of 30 million to barack obamas 2012 reelection campaign think about that a malaysian national attempting to illegally funnel tens of millions of stolen dollars into an american presidential campaign the donation never went through for campaign finance laws but the attempt reveals the scope of lows ambitions he wasnt content buying celebrities and yachts he wanted to buy political power he wanted access to the president of the united states and he believed probably correctly that enough money could get him that access 2015 when everything started falling apart by mid2015 investigative journalists had started publishing stories about 1mdbs irregularities malaysian whistleblowers were coming forward the wall street journal published detailed reports about money flowing from 1mdb into prime minister najibs personal bank accounts the entire scheme was unravelling and jho low recognizing that his time was running out made a decision that separates him from most whitecollar criminals he ran not quietly not subtly he just left first to taiwan no extradition treaty with malaysia or the us then to macau perfect for a highrolling gambler who needed to hide and eventually according to investigative journalists to mainland china in july 2018 malaysian police confirmed low had fled macau for mainland china and thats where the trail goes cold sort of the shanghai mystery in july 2025 almost a decade after fleeing malaysia investigative journalists bradley hope and tom wright who wrote the definitive book on the 1mdb scandal claimed in a livestream that theyd found jho low according to their investigation low is currently living in shanghais exclusive green hills neighbourhood under a fake identity constantinos achilles veis using a forged australian passport even more provocatively they claim low is now operating as a behindthescenes strategist for the chinese government helping sanctioned chinese companies navigate global regulatory challenges let that sink in the man who stole 45 billion from malaysia threw parties with britney spears and leo dicaprio financed the wolf of wall street and became one of historys most wanted fugitives is allegedly now working for the chinese government under a fake greekaustralian identity malaysian authorities responded by saying they have no solid evidence to verify these claims australias department of foreign affairs confirmed that passport fraud carries penalties of up to 10 years imprisonment but said they couldnt comment on individual cases so as of now in 2025 we have credible investigative journalists claiming they know exactly where jho low is and what hes doing but no government has been able to confirm it or do anything about it the questions lets talk about what we dont know because the gaps in this story are almost as interesting as what we do know wheres the rest of the money malaysia has recovered approximately 74 billion in assets sounds like a lot until you realize that at least 13 billion remains completely unaccounted for low spent maybe a billion on yachts parties jewellery gambling and real estate that leaves billions that nobody can find does low have it hidden in accounts that havent been discovered did he transfer it to people we dont know about is it sitting in chinese banks under names nobodys connected to him yet we dont know prime minister mahathir mohamad said in 2019 that evidence suggests jho low kept a lot of the 1mdb money for himself but tracking it has proven impossible its out there somewhere billions of dollars just missing why is china protecting him if the reports are true and low is living openly in shanghai working for the chinese government the obvious question is why several theories 1 low is providing valuable services to china helping sanctioned companies maybe providing intelligence about western financial systems 2 china is using low as leverage against malaysia give us what we want or well never return your fugitive 3 low has hidden chinese government money in his network of accounts and china needs him alive and cooperative to access it 4 china simply doesnt care about malaysian or american law and enjoys thumbing its nose at western justice systems we dont know which is true probably some combination but whats clear is that if low is in china hes not there by accident china doesnt let internationally wanted fugitives accused of stealing billions just wander around shanghai unless theres a reason was najib razak the mastermind or the dupe najib razak the former prime minister of malaysia is currently serving a 12year prison sentence for corruption related to 1mdb but heres whats weird najib claims his relationship with jho low has been exaggerated and that other people 1mdb ceo shahrol halmi general counsel jasmine loo and ambank manager joanna yu were actually closer to low najib sarcastically noted that yu made jho low soup when he was unwell whereas i never prepared any meals for jho low is this just a politician trying to minimize his guilt probably but theres a legitimate question about who was actually running the scheme low had the connections the financial expertise the elaborate network of shell companies najib had the political power to make it possible who was manipulating whom and heres the thing that makes you wonder najib is in prison low is allegedly living in luxury in shanghai if they were equal partners in the crime thats some seriously unequal justice what happened to all the other conspirators tim leissner the goldman sachs banker got sentenced to prison roger ng another goldman banker got 10 years some malaysian officials got prosecuted goldman sachs paid billions in fines but what about all the other people who had to have been involved the lawyers who set up shell companies the bankers who processed transactions that they must have known were suspicious the accountants who signed off on fraudulent financial statements the politicians beyond najib who took bribes hundreds of people had to have been involved in enabling a fraud this massive most of them have never been identified let alone prosecuted why did he do it jho low was already rich his family had money he had connections he could have lived a comfortable legitimate life as a malaysian businessman or investor instead he orchestrated one of historys largest financial frauds knowing that if caught hed spend decades in prison or become a permanent fugitive why the simple answer is greed but i dont think thats the whole story because lows spending wasnt rational he wasnt accumulating wealth to secure his future he was burning through billions as fast as he could steal them throwing parties buying yachts gambling millions giving away picassos he was trying to prove something to the rich kids at harrow whod looked down on him to the wharton classmates whose families made his family look middleclass to himself and he achieved that for about five years jho low was exactly that person he was legendary people talked about his parties the way they talk about studio 54 or the playboy mansion he was the most interesting person in any room he entered not because of his personality by all accounts he was quiet and awkward but because of his willingness to spend whatever it took to create unforgettable experiences the moral of this extremely immoral story if theres a lesson in the jho low saga its probably this the global financial system is shockingly easy to manipulate if you have the right connections the right documentation and the willingness to lie convincingly you can steal billions from a sovereign wealth fund with goldman sachs facilitating the transactions and throw parties with leonardo dicaprio and finance hollywood movies about financial fraud and live in luxury for years before anyone figures out what youve done",

literally own the dominant social media channels now they have their own major television channel and they have created such a perfect echo chamber that they have convinced themselves that they are a persecuted majority lets pause on that for a second a persecuted majority the very notion is ridiculous in a free democracy majorities dont get persecuted but when people feel entitled to something they arent getting they have to explain that to themselves and the cognitive dissonance often results in a notion of being a persecuted majority if germans were so clever and superior why did they lose wwi must have been the jews if white guys are so hip and cool why cant they get a date must be the immigrants yeah the real issue is jobs and wages but they dont call themselves involuntary low wage earners they call themselves incels involuntary celibates tells you pretty much all you need to know about their mentality it started with the christian right and now its spread to pretty much the entire right wing in this country theyve convinced themselves of two basically contradictory facts 1 they think they are the majority this is part of why they assume any election they lose is fraudulent its also why they feel so comfortable spouting their bullshit they assume everyone else is thinking the same thing the reason they are saying it and we are not they think isnt because we disagree with them its because were not as brave and confident and manly as they are so when you hear one of them saying some stupid nonsense remember they arent trying to convince anyone because they figure everyone in earshot is in agreement theyre trying to show their strength dont just listen in silence prove them wrong not in their ideas but in their assumption they are not the majority they just think they are 2 they think they are being repressed first of all majorities cant be repressed pretty much by definition i mean well yeah numerical majorities can workers slaves serfs plebians history is full of repressed numerical majorities but in a true democracy where civil rights are guaranteed to all that becomes more difficult not impossible were living that in real time but difficult but when i say majorities cant be repressed i mean political or social majorities groups that hold power in a society and who holds power in american society um white folks malepresenting folks christian folks and of course folks with money and who are the mazis white christian mostly male and maleprioritizing female people with money oh wait you thought the magas were poor well sure compared to the billionaire oligarchs they worship and yeah some truly are but the fact is most of the folks showing up to trump rallies following him around the country standing outside mar a lago theyre actually pretty financially comfortable its how they can afford to go to those events after all in their big rvs its how they afford the trucks have you priced a fullsize pickup lately and the guns and the stupid trump merch so theyre pretty much the folks who have always had access to all the good stuff america has to offer so why do they feel persecuted because the alt right has been dominating the soap box you see for years decades really theyve been hearing it from the pulpit and from the news neither fox nor talk radio and now podcasts really presents news but they pretend they do theyve been hearing that they are the moral majority the silent majority and that the reason they arent happy with their lives is external didnt get that promotion they wanted its not because they didnt work hard enough or go to college its because someone brown or female was promoted instead their candidate didnt win the election democrat chicanery that new truck is too expensive blame an immigrant i cant really explain all the logic here in part because this is a reddit post not a sociology book and in part because well im not sure there is any logic how do immigrants make prices go up i guess cause they also buy stuff so demand is up except more workers means wages go down so that keeps prices lower but also it is the reason you didnt get a raise well assuming youre working in a field dominated by immigrants most of us arent getting raises because the corner office folks are making billions but thats another story based on actual facts and not the one the mazis hear so the mazis are fed a steady stream of exaggerated news about the problems in america especially crime and theyre fed a bunch of false data about these made up problems crime is high and its all committed by black people and mexicans and muslims somehow school violence is up because the teachers are something trans that one gets really weird really fast some guy in rural tennessee is told he cant require his high school football team to pray to jesus and its blown up into the equivalent of the romans feeding christians to the lions this is the right wing soap box and they have also been brilliant at spreading the word for years most waiting rooms in america have had a tv on and its been tuned to fox why because if it was tuned to some other news channel a conservative complained to management but if it was on fox we just looked away read our magazines and said nothing so fox spreads and the conservatives feel that they are the majority for years conservatives have put various symbols and slogans on bumper stickers and shown themselves sometimes obviously sometimes subtly some of the bumper stickers said things like taxation is theft okay we know where that guy stands but some were more subtle iii or molon labe which i like to read as moron lame which might need to be googled iii is the three percenters a group who believes that just 3 of the population rebelled against britain so a wellarmed minority can overthrow a tyrannical read democratic government moron lame is a greek phrase attributed to leonidas the king of the spartans when he was asked to lay down his arms it basically means come and take them but the point of all of those wasnt really to convince us it was to signal each other they really say see me im here im with you were right were the majority the subtlety of some of these signs and messages actually reinforces the persecution complex too christians love to tell themselves the story of the fish being drawn quickly on the side of buildings in rome to indicate a forbidden christian church and then quickly rubbed away afterwards so putting a fish sticker on your car or business or whatever not only shows that youre a christian it also shows that you are standing up to persecution what persecution the persecution of not having the nativity scene displayed in your local mall or something definitely right up there with being fed to lions okay so what do we do well the good news is some of it is already being done there might not be a direct liberal equivalent to fox but thats a good thing we dont want our people brainwashed we want them educated and for that we have npr and the ny times sure but we also have stephen colbert and jimmy kimmel every time a comedian makes a joke at trumps expense its a ding in the alt right armor ive also noticed a distinct decline in the fox programming in the waiting rooms instead im seeing a lot of hgtv and the like that means business owners are starting to fear a reaction from the left as well as from the right good but we need to do more maybe youve seen some version of the make nazis afraid again stuff thats what we need to do the alt right folks in the regime are getting bolder and that just emboldens the ones on the street but we just won some major electoral victories more on that when i talk about the ballot box and none of the doomsday stuff about right wing violence has come to pass this is good the alt right might be telling themselves its a bloodless civil war but if so theyre losing so the folks saying the quiet part out loud are getting louder but theyre also getting more isolated keep that up put that npr magnet on your car wear that bernie tshirt you got talk about mamdani in the convenience store let the radical reactionaries hear and see just how isolated they are we are the actual silent majority its time to start being heard freeman out",
