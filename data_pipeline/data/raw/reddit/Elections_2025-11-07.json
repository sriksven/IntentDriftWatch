    "why sherrill won and the weakness of polling reason why she won 1trump the images above shows that the approval for trump in each state seems to match the republican result in each race 2 the polls were bad and effected how each candidate looked at the race atlas intel had a horrible poll that predicted that jack who get 60 percent black support but people dismissed data and the other the crosstabs the underlying data of those polls because atlasintel has been right constantly except thats not true they were wrong by 23 points in recent on puerto rico governor race and were wrong about 2022 georgia senator race atlasintel and all the other pollsters were afraid of a repeat of 2021 polling where they didnt correctly calibrate for covid lockdown backlash but in trying to fix that error that didnt calibrate correctly for trump disapproval but also polling made sherrills campaign go extra hard which leads into the next point 3sherrill campaigned harder than murphy murphys 2021 campaign was weak because of covid and his campaigns assumption that polling was 100 correct an they could just coast through reelection sherrill on the other hand was campaigning like crazy and had people like brian stack working overtime to get people out to vote 4 she has no meaning controversies mikies stock trading is not an scandal the average person does not care her stock trading when trump is taking 400mil bribes from qatar also the graduation thing was meaningless now lets talk about at virginia jay jones who had an actual controversy and it didnt sink his campaign while hes not doing as well as spanberger he is outperforming kamala in some districts the world were scandals can hurt a campaign might be dead also apologies for any grammar issues",
    "outoftouch trump talks up economy among sycophants and stars in miami it was the week in which republicans took a beating at the polls the government shutdown became the longest in history and 42 million people across the country including 3 million in florida saw their federal food aid slashed but in the alternative reality of miami where tickets to an overwhelmingly conservative business conference headlined by donald trump cost up to 1990 and billionaires from saudi arabia rubbed shoulders with equally wealthy american tycoons such as jeff bezos and ken griffin those events created barely a ripple instead in a gesture that appeared almost to mock the widening disparity between the citys haves and havenots organizers of the america business forum cooked up a little treat for attendees a 50 gift card to spend on food to sustain themselves while they listened to their president congratulate himself for a golden age he said his economic miracle had delivered advocates say the move along with the highbudget opulence of the conference itself was an illtimed insult to more than a halfmillion miamidade county residents who just saw their own ability to buy essential groceries for their families kiboshed by the gutting of the supplemental nutrition assistance program snap theres just a massive cognitive dissonance between what real people are going through and the elite said larry hannan communications and policy director of state voices florida a coalition of more than a hundred nonpartisan prodemocracy and civic engagement groups jeff bezos does not need a 50 food card but we saw that with the great gatsby theme party last week they just cant seem to stop doing things that are shockingly out of touch weve been through shutdowns before and while obviously the white house bubble is always somewhat insane presidents are usually smart enough they usually know not to flaunt this type of stuff but this administration does not seem to care the presidents hourlong address on thursday had the flavor of a political rally with familiar insults for old political foes such as senate minority leader chuck schumer and californias governor gavin newsom and a new one zohran mamdani the newly elected democratic socialist mayor of new york trump touched on his economic agenda and lauded a host of speakers from the worlds of politics sport and business that filled the twoday agenda created largely by francis suarez mayor of the city of miami to showcase south florida and its investment opportunities lionel messi the argentina soccer star and world cup winner provided celebrity glitz from sporting circles along with tennis champions rafael nadal and serena williams a conversation between suarez and mara corina machado the venezuelan opposition leader and democracy activist who last month won the nobel peace prize that trump coveted was well received on day one yet overall it was a curious and unmistakably politically charged event with a field of trump sycophants on the stage loudly cheered by a crowd of mostly younger and affluent supporters of the president in the audience some blending business suits with his trademark red make america great again maga caps how else to explain the presence of javier milei the rightwing president of argentina the country whose shaky economy trump helped shore up last month with a 20bn currency swap lifeline or that of saudi arabians fahad alsaif head of its 925bn public investment fund and reema bandar alsaud riyadhs ambassador to the us touting their country as ripe for investment while the trump familys financial ties and influence there comes under greater scrutiny then there was gianni infantino head of fifa international soccers governing body dropping hints that trump is in line for the organizations first peace prize an unwanted new award that observers see created specially for the president as consolation for his nobel snub other speakers including jamie dimon the chief executive of jp morgan adam neumann founder of wework and flow and griffin the hedgefund manager and republican donor have all previously praised worked with or voted for trump offering more than a suggestion of a politically skewed lineup suarez unsurprisingly saw it differently we wanted it to be a sort of a crosssection from different verticals right he told the guardian we got in a room we said hey what are the leading voices people from different backgrounds different ethnicities different genders sports business politics technology things that touch everyones lives he pointed to discussions of upcoming moneyspinning notable events in miami including the formula one grand prix next years g20 economic summit at trumps doral golf resort and games during the 2026 world cup which he called a generational opportunity our hope is that miamians are transformed by the experience suarez said we want them to leave thinking i can be on that stage the advocates of state voices florida however believe many miamians are more focused right now on other issues especially soaring housing and food costs republican florida governor ron desantis rejected a call from hannans group and others to declare an emergency over snap benefits and tap state reserves to fund urgent food distribution any civics teacher would tell you its his job to look after the people of florida and hes doing the exact opposite hannan said noting the juxtaposition of a conference of billionaires taking place in the same county in which almost 25 of households rely on snap benefits to survive there just seems to be this detachment at the top i dont think the answer is electing a democrat or electing a republican i just think we have to have more empathy for people who are struggling in this state empathy was in short supply in miami from trump a president not known for ever taking responsibility during a crisis the radical left democrats are causing millions of americans who depend on food stamps to go without benefits he said blaming the outofoffice opposition party for the government shutdown i just want to have a country thats great again is that ok",

    "opinion nancy pelosi retires as a master of congress ive been seeing some major disrespect for nancy pelosi around here so i thought id like to list some of her accomplishments she served as the first woman speaker of the house and was a strong leader across multiple eras the skills she has being able to maneuver congress with a precise understanding of how votes will go manage coalitions and keep party unity and building donor networks and getting democrats elected in swing states is not to be understated this alone is no minuscule feat and is worthy of praise for her leadership people with those skills are a rare breed and i find it a shame that this is not recognized a famous quote from general robert barrow can easily describe her amateurs talk tactics professionals study logistics pelosi was a true professional as an aside this quote should be remembered even in this sub as i often see people demanding general strikes without understanding what needs to happen to make it possible pelosi was undoubtedly liberal and helped the country become bluer over many decades im not sure if young people here realize how much more red this country used to be she was a core party of every major progressive accomplishment in the 21st century among many things she supported funding for aids establishing abortion rights and protecting the environment however she focused on goals that can be logistically accomplished pushing back on objectives that were unfeasible even if as a progressive it was disappointing at times i am not ashamed to admit that she is far more knowledgeable and aware than i on these matters in fact shes far more knowledgable and aware than nearly all of us it is under her leadership that the affordable care act was passed i dont believe most people understand what it took to get this done democrats were fracturing on obamas health reform bill and pelosi managed to hold everything together with key compromises and delivered the votes while it was a weakened version of what was originally drafted the fact that it passed at all under intense republican pressure was nothing short of amazing she repealed the homophobic and damaging dont ask dont tell within a tight deadline shortly before republicans retook the house she helped us recover from the 2008 crash by funding clean energy unemployment benefits and infrastructure she initiated two impeachment proceedings against donald trump and refused to normalize him she passed climate investments domestic manufacturing initiatives lower prescription drug costs and more pelosis political presence was a major boon for liberals and progressives alike for her long career without her wed be in an even worse timeline than we are now while she has her stances that can be criticized such as her wall street relationships and incremental social welfare expansions she is undoubtedly one of the most effective speakers in us history breaking ground in political leadership this is not just for a woman as any other speaker would dream of being able to have her skills in outmaneuvering the other party even if it required frustrations i have nothing but respect for her anyone who disrespects nancy pelosi and holds hatred for her is foolishly naive and lacks character even if she may not be progressive enough for some of us today it is on her shoulders that we all stand and see into a better future may she enjoy her retirement with happiness and peace",

    "sunnyside square part 3 wednesday monday tuesday 1999 what felt like mere moments later sandra found herself standing in the sunlight and shadows of her childhood bedroom there were tears in her eyes but she didnt remember why she hadnt cried before she sang at the funeral she had felt like she might and then she had gone away the western angle of the sunlight shining over the weeded field outside her window told her that the funeral had ended hours ago papas footsteps in the stables behind the house sparked flashes of memories papa hugging her after her song you did good girly he was crying for the first time in her life mama would be proud the quiet ride back to the little white house that morning how are you holding up sandra caroline only wanted to be kind sandra wanted to let herself cry let herself be held in her grief she couldnt she wasnt herself anymore im fine thanks then an impenetrable smile the last moments before caroline drove down the dirt path to home she was only going to say goodbye to her father they were shooting again in 12 hours the conversation with her father that had just ended moments ago hey baby are you okay he pulled her into a hug that felt like home even with the sweat and the smell of cow manure im fine papa what can i do for you before we go she needed to help him with something it was all she knew to do why dont you just come inside for a spell maybe have a glass of lemonade ill come in for a minute but then we have to go our plane leaves in an hour time froze when they walked through the back door with its screen full of holes the house was just like she remembered it her mothers purse was still on the kitchens oversized white table the air still smelled of her favorite candle yankees vanilla cupcake the smell made her feel like a girl again like the child she had been before pageants and auditions and the world found her with their spotlights welcome home sandra her fathers voice carried a warm sadness he was happy to have her home but they both knew it would never really be home again she wanted to stay with her father and rest in their shared inexpressible feelings she couldnt sunnyside square was waiting excuse me for a moment her feet knew where she needed to go she left caroline and her father in the kitchen and walked down the houses one hallway she walked into the bedroom and closed the door behind her for the first time since monday she let herself cry finding herself in the air of her girlhood she realized she had gone away again she hadnt been herself since her song at the funeral everything that had happened since had happened to someone else someone who could be who the world needed sandra didnt know how long she had been crying but she knew that caroline and her father were waiting she couldnt let them see her like this squeezing through the pinch of a path between the vanity and the pinkquilted bed that her mother had kept perfectly made she looked into the face of an old friend her first friend rupert the rabbit granny ruth had given him to her as a baby and he had waited on her pillow for her even though his red fur had grayed with age she turned to the mirror to make herself presentable she saw someone she didnt recognize the woman looked like her but she was more her hair was higher her eyes were bigger and brighter and no matter what sandra did the woman in the mirror held a toothy smile that stretched from ear to ear she was everything sandra tried to be she was horrifyingand beautiful sandra had never seen her before but she had known her as long as she could remember she was the one who smiled through the pain who sang at her mothers funeral who lied through this mornings conversations with caroline and her father she was sunny sandy 2024 mikey woke up gasping for air finding himself at his desk he noticed it was too bright outside still half asleep he reached for his phone and saw that it was almost 1000 panic he was two hours late for the meet and greet even then mikey couldnt afford not to take time for appearances with visions of the twisted park and the pink void lingering in his mind he showered and shaved while his head reeled from the empty bottle of wine while he tied his tie in the mirror he almost thought he saw sunny sandys smile where his should have been he reminded himself to smile correctly for the voters they wanted him happy but not too happy he drove a little too fast to make up for his tardiness he never sped but he was not as careful as he would have normally been driving through primrose park the neighborhood demanded decorum on the north side of dove hill its residents were either wealthy retirees or people who would inevitably become wealthy retirees the train depot where bree was hosting the meet and greet was a relic of the towns early days as a railroad hub some time during the great exodus of union jobs ambitious housewives had decided to build a gated community around the abandoned stationwith everything from its own private park to its own private country club mikey knew there would be trouble when he couldnt find a parking space near the depot primrose park was full of people who would never allow more parking to be built but would always complain about having to walk bree had not expected much of a turnout when she planned this event she knew that most of the neighborhoods residents would vote for pruce the chamber of commerces preferred candidate this was a stop that had to be made for appearances now though people were lined up out the door mikey tried to enter the building without demanding attention he circled the long way around to enter through the back door he was almost there when a grandmother in a sharp white pantsuit gave him an expectant wave that was when hungry whispers joined the sound of graceful gossip mikey took a deep breath and opened the wooden door as he entered the way his breath felt in his body made him think that tommy would have liked the train depot before it was transfigured by primrose park he liked trains mikey had too of course bree had the depot perfectly set for the scene mikey was an actor walking onto the stage two hours after his cue he worried that bree would notice something wrong maybe it would be his wrinkled shirt or the scent of old wine that had clung through his shower while he tried to fight the memories of his dreamsnow joined by pictures of a large purple pig and a red rabbitpart of mikey wished that his sister would notice youre late bree stated bluntly from behind the welcome table it was surrounded by pictures of the man who wasnt him his eyes were full of promise brees were empty there was no flash of affection this time i know im sorry i woke no time for that mikey wished she would be angry with him it would be better than the annoyance that boiled like a covered pot annoyance was all that bree would show walking to the door she flashed on her smile like she was biting something hard mikey followed her lead just like he had done since they were kids he turned to shake hands with brees friend who had gotten them into the depot for the event she worked as the groundskeeper for the neighborhood and knew the residents would relish an opportunity to meet someone who might soon matter thanks for your help today mikey said with words bree would have found too simple youre welcome brees friend said she made an empathetic grimace behind brees back mikey didnt let himself laugh the air that entered the historicallypreserved building when bree opened the door tasted of pressed flesh one by one the primrose park residents brought their pushing pleasantries bree walked back to the welcome table and noticed that mikey was matching their effortful energy she gave him a stern look that felt like a kick he did his best to smile better during the first onslaught of guests bree strategically mingled around the room bree worked her way to the residents her research said would be most likely to influence the others mrs gingham who worked as the provost at the school mr lampton the mayor leblancs deputy chief of staff brees friend followed her a tail to a meteor mikey manned his post with force he greeted each and every resident of primrose park with a surgical precision to one hi there im mikey dobson nice to meet you to another with a phrase turned just so good morning im mikey thanks for coming out today never anything too intimate or too aloof though they came in tired and glistening from the summer heat the residents seemed to approve of mikeys presentation they at least matched his graceful airs with their own he wished he could get to know these peopleask them about their concerns or their hopes for their town but this was not the time for that it was certainly not the place this was the time to be serviceablejust like the trains that used to run through this station mechanical and efficient months ago mikey would have felt anxious now he just felt absent every time he shook a hand or gave a respectably distant hug or posed for a picture he felt himself drift further and further away by the time the first hour on the conveyor belt ended he had nearly lost himself in the man on the postersthe man who wasnt him that was when he noticed bree smiling towards him over the shoulder of a grumpy old man with a sharp wooden cane it was the smile of a satisfied campaign manager of an a student proud of their final project the man who wasnt him was doing well when the old married couple at the beginning of the end of the line entered the station mikey was nearly gone well hi there im glad you made it through that line thanks for stopping by today he had just given the wife a kind squeeze of the hand when he was snatched back to the depot reaching for the hand of a handsome young man who smelled like a lobbyist he saw her in the door frame sunny sandy she was wearing her signature pink dress mikey correctly exchanged business cards with the lobbyist and gave a cursory look at the vistaprint creation when he looked back sunny sandy was gone she had been replaced with a harriedlooking young mother in a couture tracksuit only the color was the same the woman continued down the line another forgotten exchange and she was back sunny sandy with her aura blasting bliss mikey knew it was her from her smile she hadnt aged in 30 years another disposable photo and she was gone again the woman in the line looked much too ordinary to be sunny sandy she had had struggles and challenges and feelings still there was something about her like sandy she was trying to play her part the best she could mikey gave a firm handshake to the grumpy old man bree had been talking to he thought he made a good impression the man at least said thanks son then he was standing before the woman she wasnt sunny sandy but she had her smile up close it looked different than it had on tv it was a smile that strained from the pressure on her teeth a smile of a woman insisting on her own strength a smile that blinded with its whiteness mikey went to shake the womans hand but he could only see her teeth in that dazzling determined smile then he could only see white for a moment mikey felt relief while he floated in the liminal white space he did not have to perform for anyone not for the people of primrose park not for bree not even for himself he could just be then he started to remember what he had left behind bree was certainly staring stakes into him as he stood there blankly the young mother was surely doubting voting for a candidate who seemed to be somewhere else he could feel everyone in the depot watching him it felt like all of dove hill he hoped the man who wasnt him could take the pressure better than he had before he could start panicking the floating ended his feet landed on firm ground he closed his eyes and braced himself to continue the performance when he opened his eyes he was not at the depot he wasnt sure where he was exactly he could tell he was outside from the air that smelled like an oakscented candle and the sun that beat down with a heavy glare he was in a grass square enclosed by a brick wall white benches surrounded him they looked like they had just been painted for him the walled square was surrounded by a larger square made from four rows of buildings their facades were stylized down to the individual knots in the wood a stainless steel staff wrapped by two golden snakes rose from one another displayed a tin sign reading post office in crimson red letters it was difficult to see through the windows that reflected the harsh shards of light but most of the buildings looked empty deeply empty on the inside the sunlight drew mikeys eyes to the sky he expected to have to strain to see the sun but it was easy the piercing light wasnt coming from the sun at all the sun was a large paper mache ball the color of a cautionary traffic cone it was surrounded by sharp yellow triangles of construction paper he remembered that sun from saturday mornings he was in sunnyside square he couldnt understand the feelings that flooded his brain like the light crashing from everywhere but the sun there were too many of them he was relieved to have landed somewhere after the white abyss when he found himself in the park from his dream his legs felt strong beneath him and his mind stopped racing that stillness was something he had not felt in years he was glad to be in a place he remembered happily in the square he knew how the day would end with a nap and a snack when he watched it as a child everything in sunnyside square made sense it made his world make sense it made him make sense but none of this made sense he was in a place that didnt exist it had never existed in reality it hadnt existed in a studio since the 1990s mikey felt his stomach wretch as his mind tried to locate his body while the scene around him was familiar it was also wrong it was like a song he learned in music class had been transposed into an atonal scream on his television sunnyside square had felt full of life sunny sandy and her friends seemed to love playing together in the square this place whatever it was felt dead if his sunnyside square had been an old friend this place was that same old friend smiling up from their casket as his heart slowed in his chesthe couldnt tell whether it was from calm or dread both maybehe felt something standing behind him he turned and saw a large wooden door towering above him a door hadnt looked so tall since he was a kid he recognized this one it was the door to sunny sandys house that sat right in the middle of the park that sat right in the middle of the square through all the feelings he couldnt ignorethe comfort and the confusion the peace and the panicmikey felt his hand reach up to the gold knocker a sunflower with a stem for the handle part of him wanted to be welcomed into his friends house part of him wanted to run and never look back his hand knocked without his permission one two three on what would have been the fourth knock in common time the door opened to a large hallway in the same dark wood as the door like the door the hallway loomed over mikey its roof was so far above him that it faded into black all he could see above him was a dark space swirling with dust in front of him a grand staircase followed the roof into the void beyond each bannister the hallway was lined with two rooms forming yet another square mikey felt like the walls were closing in to suffocate him in a hug he could hear voices from the other rooms two quiet clucks from the kitchen a muttering from the library mikey stepped into the threshold to follow a hoot coming from the music room the staircase cleared its throat and the voices ended in a frightened silence mikey turned to look out of the black a bubblegum ghost descended the carpeted steps sunny sandy for a moment when the ghost was near the end of its walk mikey felt his feeling fear it was something that might have been sunny sandybefore now the figure looked like sunny sandy made into a living mannequin its thighhigh hot pink dress was frozen into a hard aframe it wore electric blue high heels that fixed its legs in a pounce and a large yellow belt that made its waist want to snap its hair was formed into a cyclone of a jaundiced beehive that did not move with the air the only part of the friend mikey had known that remained was the shape of its smile even that was hard its teeth razorsharp the figure was now facing mikey though its frame was petite it shadowed him by at least a foot mikey felt his limbs stick like plastic hi friend the figure chirped welcome to sunnyside square mikeys eyes were painted open im sunny sandy said the figure that was not sunny sandy whats your name mikey did not want to tell the figure his name he did not want to invite it inside still even in this place wherever it was mikey had to be polite he started to ask excuse me can you please tell me where i am he couldnt when he tried to open his lips they formed a rictus smile the feeling reminded him of the meet and greet he tried again and again the whole time the figure simply stared at him in pedantic expectation mikeys lips trembled in their unwanted expression animals in the wrong colors peeked out from the rooms around him a red rabbit an orange owl a blue turtle tommy these were the friends he remembered they were still there with this creature they watched nervously while hiding from the figures gaze what had become of sunny sandy giggled at mikey she was laughing at him silly mikey she knew his name if you cant say anything nice you wont say anything at all from the doorway to the kitchen maggie the magenta moo cow waved a hoof nervously she pointed to herself and mouthed hello sandy my name is her eyes worried for her friend he should have remembered it was how every episode started hello sandy my name is mikey it is nice to meet you he did his best to mean it somehow he knew that sandy would accept nothing less sandy smiled on cue through her glassy eyes mikey could tell he had tested her patience nice to meet you mikey were going to have a super sunny day today because in sunnyside square the sun can never stop smiling before mikey could try to speak again he was back in the campaign he was with bree in their makeshift office in the civic center the dust from the boxes of unused festival trinkets formed in the same lines as it had in the black above sandys house bree was pacing in the few square feet of space around the illfitting desk she was in the middle of a critique believe that stephanie let us into that depot without warning us even if the polling had been right that shack would have been too small mikey waited for his review he recognized brees tone it wouldnt be good we had to leave those old people outside in the heat at least stephanie could have told me to bring fans and extension cords bree continued to berate the air for what felt like half an hour before she noticed mikey wherever he had gone she apparently hadnt noticed when bree looked at him mikey began his apology i know i was awkward i didnt ask the right questions i looked uncomfortable i huh bree asked no you were you were fine good even thanks mikey wondered aloud he had expected to feel the fire that was his sister aiming for an achievement yeah it seems like youve really gotten the hang of this politician shtick she smiled at him like she was impressed he had learned to tie his shoes he appreciated his big sister for trying to compliment him in the only way she knew how it was all he was going to get i guess mikey didnt feel like he had gotten used to anything making small talk still felt like speaking a foreign language asking for votes was opening a vein he wouldnt even try soliciting donations the longer bree paced the more mikey allowed himself to forget what had happened in the square he told himself that it had just been a daydreameven if it had felt more like a nightmare he hadnt dissociated he had just gone away for a while that was healthy how did you feel about it bree asked mikey had not expected that he didnt have time to calculate the correct answer ii made it he said with a forced laugh its still scary but i think im like giving directions to the interstate bree answered youre doing fine theres nothing to be scared of just think of all the people in their underwear mikey had never understood that lesson he knew bree had learned it at the community theatre and then passed it onto him but it never helped he wished not being scared was as easy as that yeah thats good advice mikey really did love her for trying it was what she did best the dobson siblings sat in silence for a moment bree started to take notes on the rest of the week strategizing how to make up for the meet and greet mikey stared out the window streaked with grime on the inside uh he stammered bree looked up for a moment mikey tried to look like he was thinking to himself as he watched out the glass he saw a rabbit bounce past the window he decided to take a chance honestly bree stared at him her eyes tried to hide her discomfort in the dobsons lives the word honestly had never meant anything good he pressed on i think the stress may be getting to me just a little im fine i probably just need to walk more and eat better he thought he should probably stop drinking too brees fear broke through she didnt scream but her perpetual momentum paused mikey she soothed are you okay he knew what that meant thats what she had asked when their parents stopped calling after the hospital one minute he had been giving a speech for his campaign for student body president the next he felt like he was going to die at the podium then he was in a bed under fluorescent lights the doctors called it extreme exhaustion and gave him a prescription for prozac he spent the spring semester of his junior year taking classes from brees apartment im good he had learned the words that would stop this conversation i promise this time it didnt work if you need to take a break we can spare a day brees offer was genuine but mikey could tell it pained her to make it when he lost the student election bree told him not to blame himself his parents didnt say anything he wondered if

    "sued my hoa mostly won now my nemesis is moving out and selling her home at a loss i successfully took my hoa to arbitration last year sorry for the lengthy screed this was years in the making tldr at bottom the background it started after i moved in the day i moved in and the president insisted on getting unfettered access to my exclusive use patio area which she enjoyed access to from agreement of the previous owner of my condo this area just happens to 1 contain all the utility boxes for the eight units in the building and 2 looks right into my living room and bedroom right in you are literally 10 feet away from my bed for example this lady wanted to be able to walk into the patio area any time she needed to flip a breaker this area was quitclaim deeded to my unit thirty years ago so yeah i said no she threatened to sue and had an ally on the board the secretary backing her i tried to work out an arrangement where she and others gave me notice by calling or emailing me and id let them in they agreed until they didnt when the president had a vendor over who tripped a breaker she just reached over the gate and unlocked it and waltzed in while i wasnt home didnt call or write i knew this because i set up cameras because i subscribe to the trustbutverify theory of life you should too btw so since she violated the agreement i canceled it for everybody were now two years into this you want to get to your breaker give me five days notice and ill pencil you in hoa meetings are now getting pretty heated meanwhile things arent getting done around the building landscaping isnt getting taken care of the president eventually wants the association to pay to repair her deck which is exclusively her responsibility per ccrs but she says its the buildings because its attached to the building and is therefore a common element mental goddamn gymnastics at this point i asked for an internal dispute resolution as required by ccrs did i mention i know them by heart now and met with our secretary to discuss my issues i had 13 of them by this point by the way i couldnt meet with our vp because he was quite senile and should not have been serving at all man couldnt follow a conversation at all anyway the secretary agreed with my issues i left him a copy of a document to sign and share with the boardand waitedand waitedi followed up three days later and he said he didnt agree with anything and wouldnt sign the arbitration so i gathered up all my evidence and immediately paid to get arbitration started i wrote a 90 page document outlining all the issues with copies of emails photographs meeting minutes citations from our ccrs the civil and corporate codes nukes knives sharp sticks btw tools like chatgpt get a bad rap but they helped me draft my submissions and they were a big help i had to double check 100 of everything it cited and there were a lot of hallucinations but i caught it all the whole thing could have been settled on the submission of documents which would have been drastically cheaper for all involved but the president who is a lawyer by the way insisted on an inperson hearing the hoa also hired a lawyer who was present at the hearing and advised them for a few weeks before because you can never have enough lawyers am i right the hearing was a joke the arbitration association and arbitrator said dont repeat stuff that you submitted just share new stuff or present testimony so thats what i initially didbut thats not what my opponent and her lawyer did so what should have taken an hour or maybe two took the whole day because i decided to get detailed too i was not ignorant of the fact that this was chachinging the hoas legal bill two weeks later we get the arbitration award i got 9 of my 13 points awarded the board asked that i be responsible for their costs i successfully argued that unless one side swept the other it would be too difficult to discern who won so everyone should bear their costs the arbitrator agreed turns out btw that this was a solid strategy to avoid getting stuck with the bill dont just arbitrate for one issue make the final winner ambiguous so long as you achieve your key goals obviously this only works if you dont want the other side to pay your fees the aftermath so by now the hoa had almost bankrupted itself they started with 30k in the bank and were left with 4k which juuuuust covers operating costs after paying the attorneys retainer but there are still 10k outstanding my direct costs btw were a couple thousand in arbitration fees the hoas costs would have been similar if the president hadnt been such a lazy wimp and done her own work so the day after the award is delivered the president called for a special assessment to pay the remaining balance this was her brilliant backup plan if she couldnt force me to pay but whoops one of my issues from that 90 page document was the fact that we didnt have election rules also that we hadnt formally created and accepted an annual budget in two years which per the law are all required if youre going to pass a special assessment in order to create the election rules the hoa needs to hire an attorneywho they can no longer afford to pay the president tried to call for an emergency special assessment but sorry emergencies are clearly defined by the law and this aint one of them so were stuck in this weird place where we cant have elections and cant levy special assessments were paying the law firm a token amount every month which will take years to finish which they are pissed about otherwise we risk overdrawing the account after other bills are paid we still dont have an accepted budget because our treasurer is a feckless twit oh and the board hasnt enacted a single one of the arbitrators orders i did get the award converted to a court order and am still waiting on the judge to convert it to a judgement took care of that myself too the cherry on top of all this is that the president has sold their home at a loss and is moving away she has lived here a decade i think she had a falling out with the secretary because the secretary stopped voting in lockstep with her on every single issue another owner who was also threatened with a lawsuit over some renovations by this lady knocked on my door the other day to share the good news its absolutely a pyrrhic victory because im not going to get my demands met any time soon and the association is in a tenuous financial position where one unexpected bill could overdraw our account im not sure if ill go after the board for contempt of not following the arbitrators and eventually the courts orders or not although i do believe i can get a court to successfully order a special assessment without us having the requisite framework i may try that i am most grateful to my opponent for the incredibly valuable lesson on how the law works i learned so much i wrote motions declarations and orders learned how to properly serve someone this took a bunch of trial and error actually turns out its actually quite simple the trick is you know knowing which laws to cite finding them and the related case law and so on you need time attention to detail and so on im a former journalist so this was all in my wheelhouse i used to be really scared about this sort of thing but im not anymore and that is such a great feeling tldr thanks to our former president being a selfish ass who was too lazy to know the details of our ccrs or the civil codes despite being a practicing attorney and our hoa board not doing its basic job in a number of areas i fought and mostly won a battle that ground the functioning of our hoa to a halt the hoa cant get anything it is ordered to do done because it cant afford it it cant carry out basic maintenance like it is required to for the same reason and it cant raise substantial money to solve these problems because it cant afford to pay professionals to write the election rules it needs first i warned them every step of the way but the president wouldnt listen the president has become something of a pariah and just sold their home at a loss and is fucking off to greener pastures good riddance",
    "conservatives solution to a political issue is always to destroy it entirely when was the last time you heard a conservative say something like we really need to work to improve the immigration process so that less people immigrate illegally and more people immigrate legally apply that same statement to whatever political issue that you have in mind snap stuff ebt education abortion voting etc the conservative solution is never how do we make this system function better its always to get rid of it entirely one of the biggest things trump talked about was getting rid of the department of education how about we pass legislation and work to improve it instead i know trump cannot pass legislation to save his life because hes a terrible leader but still the rhetoric from normal right wing people should be more about improving not nuking its so bizzare theres never a nuanced take its never maybe the welfare system is bloated and inefficient so we should streamline it no its always people on welfare are lazy freeloaders cut the whole thing like okay bro cool but whats your plan for the single mom with two kids who cant afford childcare on her 12hr job uh well maybe she should have made better life choices awesome very helpful solved poverty i guess its this fundamental difference in worldview liberals tend to see systems as improvable conservatives see them as inherently corrupt or unsalvageable the solution to any problem that involves government or collective action is to just nuke it from orbit you can even see this mindset perfectly in the 2020 election instead of saying hey mailin voting might be more accessible but we need better safeguards or verification trump and conservatives went straight to ban mailin voting its all fraud they spent months telling their own supporters not to vote by mail and then acted shocked when the mailin votes overwhelmingly from democrats were counted later and shifted states blue overnight and instead of going yeah maybe thats what happens when you tell your base not to use mail ballots they turned around and screamed voter fraud the election was stolen and did an insurrection like dude you literally set up the conditions for that exact outcome you told your voters not to use the method that was counted last then acted like the counting order was proof of a conspiracy",

    "observations from for the crowd power principles for disaffected democrats this is an article i wrote on medium a few days ago that id love to discuss further im a former student of tim walz so the last year has had an additional foil of frustration to it you can see the original article here but ill paste the text below for people who dont want to leave reddit observations from for the crowd power principles for disaffected democrats a year ago my high school geography teacher lost his bid to become the vice president of the united states while seventyfive million americans felt immense repudiation in this loss i find that my experience supporting tim walzs candidacy was a disappointment due to democratic party leadership who clearly misunderstood the united states today the biggest miss for me was the democratic partys choice to designate tim walz as coach it felt reductive that his ninetyone days in nomination were marketed as such since then his running mate has termed his performance at the vice presidential debate a fumble i want to point out that this is an insult of her own making not his he was a teacher first and best his coaching career an extracurricular activity the campaigns focus on which demonstrated how the democratic party was worse than backward facing it was boring tim walz began teaching for an educational startup in guangdong china upon returning to america he taught at alliance high school in nebraska while a bulldog a classrooms folding divider separated him from his soontobe wife gwen whipple after marrying the couple taught at west high school in gwens home state in addition to their courses the two organized student summer trips to china and actively engaged them to participate in the community it was a teachers engagement with their students at a republican presidential campaign event that began mr walzs political career not a football game tim and gwen walz were never my coaches they were my teachers my point is not to just examine a moniker but instead the 2024 democratic partys understanding of what drives progressive americans today while his coaching career was remarkable it limited his appeal every single person in america has had at least one good teacher i attended a public high school with many two of them were the walzes focusing on coach instead of teach appears driven by a perspective that found football the pinnacle of american culture any taylor swift fan knows that is not true today yesterday the democratic party succeeded showing it was not dead by winning elections this was not because the partys leadership had any vision but because the crowd and those from it chose its own path today i am not just writing to needle a former presidential candidate and her marketing team but instead to share some power principles with the crowd that like me observed the misadventures of 2024s democratic party i believe these principles are something each member of our crowd should consider as they begin having conversations taking action and supporting candidates as we seek to keep america kind and move toward a more perfect union the power principles for disaffected democrats the next election while america is today exactly one year past its last nationwide election we have only 363 days until our next now is the time to clear any nascent malaise about a future we will vote on tuesday november 3rd 2026 as we build toward that election keep in mind that a significant portion of americans did not vote in 2024 the crowd must find and demonstrate why their vote matters the party invite while it is important to know who you are there is real art to be found attending unsuspecting parties this is doubly important if there is only one political party with power in your state you can register as a republican and vote in their primaries your political party affiliation does not affect who you canvass or vote for if you want to see a change in america switch your party registration and vote in the primaries for a candidate who best represents your values the engagement with brand names there are many ways to refer to someone but we have become a society that invariably refers to a brand in particular the presidents brands drives clicks and attention i have stopped using these brands in conversations and focus on american ideals when asked on a brand i use practical terms such as president the lame duck or the most fashionable of fourletter proper nouns them when you refuse to engage with a brand you put america first the brands bait if the popular adage holds that the opposite of love is not hate use indifference to pursue change dont take the brands bait recall that some time ago canada greenland and the panama canal would be annexed march that alcatraz was to become an active prison july none of these things happened ignore the flooded zone especially parts you have no control to change find the high ground and laugh the crowds power will always be weaponized indifference image the nation portlands theateroftheabsurd protests reflect the ridiculousness of trumps lies the onsetting generational shift the oldfashioned respect for the young has fast died out in the democratic party few today are the gerontocracy who champion those with longer to live the crowd should not wait for the hippies or their staffers if those individuals ever had control of political power they would teach us how to keep it instead they from their populationdense ivory towers gave up on states they still believe are lost with respect to their accomplishments how many rights remain and are not under direct threat today abortion voting and birthright citizenship are just a few examples we the people need to say thank u next your my art art has an impact that tothepoint door knocking phone calls and other canvassing cannot the clever signs at no kings protests memes and other forms of engagement are the vibration of social media these efforts however vain do affect voters they show someone cared enough about a point or politician to make it i advocate supporting campaigns on your terms in some capacity with art you do not have to be banksy or keith haring to make art that impacts people and policy if your art impacts one person you helped the most terrifying problem for a regime that demands absolute belief is not direct opposition but radical imagination go make your political art share it our crowded america has need of it in addition my other work in 2024 i created a threehour dj mix that riffed off my favorite tim walz internet meme this is music i am proud of not only for that election but moving forward if postcard writing is how you want to contribute to a campaign give my art a watch or listen",

    "the signs of the times coming to an end or a middle wordoftheday 3 as jesus was sitting on the mount of olives the disciples came to him privately tell us they said when will this happen and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age 4 jesus answered watch out that no one deceives you 5 for many will come in my name claiming i am the messiah and will deceive many 6 you will hear of wars and rumors of wars but see to it that you are not alarmed such things must happen but the end is still to come 7 nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom there will be famines and earthquakes in various places 8 all these are the beginning of birth pains 9 then you will be handed over to be persecuted and put to death and you will be hated by all nations because of me 10 at that time many will turn away from the faith and will betray and hate each other 11 and many false prophets will appear and deceive many people 12 because of the increase of wickedness the love of most will grow cold 13 but the one who stands firm to the end will be saved 14 and this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations and then the end will come matthew 24314 todays wordoftheday scripture reference is rather lengthy but what jesus tells his disciples has occurred and is occurring volcanoes erupted and are erupting several earthquakes have hit the world and more are likely to come we continue to see skirmishes in the middle east china is saberrattling taiwan and russia continues to fight their war with ukraine ongoing for almost four years weve gone through covid and several strains of the flu new yorkers have forgotten about 911 and freemarket capitalism as an islamic socialistcommunist immigrant has been elected mayor of new york city a person who texted a desire to kill a political opponent and his children won the attorney general position in virginia we must ask what is wrong with the people who elected them were there not better candidates we had possibly the most influential christian leader of world the former pope proclaiming in paraphrase true christians should not share the gospel with nonbelievers verbally but by example in other words dont tell others about jesus but let them figure it out through watching you but if they dont know jesus how can they figure out what your intentions are and what they represent that pope passed and now the current pope states he will baptize ufo aliens if they land here he must not have watched that documentary with mel gibson signs or hed know aliens melt like the wicked witch of oz when hit with water this places the theology of this pope in question it may seem like things are pointing to the endtimes occurring soon but we have to remember many times since jesus ascended in acts 19 that throughout history volcanoes have erupted earthquakes have shaken down cities hurricanes and typhoons have devastated nations and plagues have hit and killed millions political intrigue hit as the roman empire split in two then both empires fell empires have risen and then over time also fell after romes demise communism struck russia then grew into the soviet union spread into china southeast asia and cuba and eastern europe then it fell in the soviet union and the iron curtain was lifted and eastern europe became free again now islamic fundamentalists are taking over western europe it is a cycle of similar results though the players change today these may or may not be signs the endtimes and they may or may not be the beginning of the birth pains as jesus states in verse 8 we are seeing and experiencing what jesus is talking about and some of the examples mentioned in verses 4 through 12 but you need to be aware of these things again my mantra in these times is to be prepared be aware plan accordingly using the common sense the lord gave us if you are not prepared for these hiccups we are experiencing get prepared pray up read up stock up for these storms we are in and before the next set of storms arrive but the focus should be on verses 13 and 14 pay attention to what is going on around you but do not let these things get you down or diminish your faith in jesus stand firm and despite the former popes advice proclaim the gospel through your words and deeds and fulfill the great commission think of job and the steadfast faith he had even after god allowed everything his possessions his family his health be taken away from him job would not blame or curse god for his condition except to say the lord gives and the lord takes away blessed be my lord job 121 the gospel will be proclaimed despite those who say it wont or shouldnt because jesus said otherwise in verse 14 and matthew 281620 the gospel will be preached in all nations to all people groups stand firm in the word of our lord in faith we must not only survive but thrive in these times to be jesus heralds for his message of salvation do not hide or talk in fear but walk tall and proudly proclaim your faith by elmer yeager murdock baptist church",

demonstration outside the bbc in october 2024 in mr prescotts view which may well strike a chord with many in the uks jewish community the bbcs executive repeatedly failed to implement measures to resolve highlighted problems and in many cases simply refused to acknowledge there was an issue at all on no other occasion in my professional life have i witnessed what i did at the bbc with regard to how management dealt with or failed to deal with serious recurrent problems 1 bbc arabics sharply divergent reporting of the israelipalestinian conflict compared to the bbcs english language website in internal bbc report compared five months of coverage 7 may 6 october 2024 of the israelipalestinian conflict between the bbcs english language website 535 articles and bbc arabic 523 articles according to the prescott dossier published by the telegraph this exposed stark differences between the two the english language website had posted 19 different stories about hostages taken by hamas on 7 october 2023 bbc arabic had posted none by contrast however all articles critical of israel posted on the english language website had also been posted on bbc arabic prescott also said that the englishlanguage website had three times as many stories that primarily dealt with the suffering of israelis these included the horrors faced by hostages held captive in gaza how traumatised israeli communities were coping hamas and hezbollah rocket attacks on residential israeli communities and growing antisemitism these were all missing from bbc arabic he said there had been four articles critical of hamas on the english language website none had been put on bbc arabic 2 bbc arabics coverage of the story of the girl enslaved by isis and liberated from gaza fawzia sido was a yazidi woman who was captured by isis in iraq at the age of 11 and who was married a sex slave to a palestinian fighting in syria bearing two children before the age of 15 after her husband was killed she was smuggled back to gaza in 2020 remaining under the control of her husbands family as well as hamas she was liberated by israeli soldiers the bbc news english website covered the story which as prescott said detailed her escape and rescue with backup for her claims from the us state department and the iraqi authorities portland place london uk 4th february 2024 photo by amanda roseamandarosephoto however as prescott showed the bbc arabic version of the story was markedly different the headline was israel says yazidi prisoner returned to iraq after ten years in gaza hamas tells bbc israel narrative is fabricated while the bulk of bbc arabics story is taken up by a 582wordlong statement by hamas disputing the womans terrible story 3 bbc arabics coverage of the october 2024 hamas terror attack in jaffa on 1 october 2024 two hamas terrorists killed seven people and injured 17 prescott refers to major content and tone differences between the english language and bbc arabic stories as he sets out the bbc news english website revealed how the victims included inbar segev vigder a young mother who died shielding her ninemonthold baby from harm bbc arabic covered the story under the headline the qassam brigades claims responsibility for the jaffa operation what do we know about it the report presented the attack as a military operation and gave no information about the victims 4 bbc arabics coverage of the majdal shams attack in july 2024 hezbollah bombed a druze town in the golan heights hitting children who were in the middle of a football match nine of whom died prescott described how the bbc english language coverage and bbc arabic coverage were given critically different treatment as he writes the english language version included hezbollahs denials that it was responsible for the majdal shams rocket strike but included evidence to suggest it had bombed other sites in the area the bbc arabic story posted four hours after the english language version did not include evidence linking hezbollah to the bombing of a nearby military compound just two miles from the football pitch and prominently included the terror groups denials its headline referred to israelis being killed and injured in the attack not children furthermore prescott wrote a daytwo story covered on the arabic website contained unsubstantiated claims from iran and syria that israel faked the attack as a pretext for attacking hezbollah 5 the bbcs executives response to the evidence against bbc arabic the bbcs executive was sent the above findings in january 2025 prescott mentions that one very experienced person attending the egsc editorial guidelines and standards committee meeting described the findings as the most extraordinary paper she had ever seen it should have prompted urgent action by the executive but it did not instead prescott says the deputy head of bbc news jonathan munro responded to the information by writing that while no service is perfect and all of us can make mistakes we believe bbc arabic delivers against its responsibilities with the vast majority of its reporting and analysis munro said that bbc arabics reporters were an unrivalled source of knowledge and editorial content for the wider bbc and the team had delivered exceptional journalism during this period prescott goes into considerable detail about how munro appeared to downplay the findings of the report on bbc arabic the report sent to the bbc executive in january had shown that on bbc arabic there were far fewer stories from an israeli perspective over the fivemonth review period than from a palestinian perspective jonathans response was to ignore the review period and find stories outside the scope of the review prescott went on to say that munros response to bbc arabics reporting of hamas was to argue that the high prominence given to hamas lines helps understanding of what palestinians in the west bank and gaza may be hearing 6 bbc arabics use of deeply compromised journalists in gaza was far worse than previously realised prescott describes how media stories about the antisemitic and prohamas views of journalists appearing on bbc arabic forced another internal review into the channel in june 2025 such journalists included samer elzaenen revealed by the telegraph to have posted a number of antisemitic comments including suggesting jews should be burned as hitler did another example was ahmed qannan who described a gunman who killed four civilians and an israeli police officer as a hero a third was ahmed alagha who described israelis as less than human and jews as devils originally it was reported that elzaenen had featured on bbc arabic a dozen times prescott says that the bbcs internal review showed elzaenen had actually appeared 244 times on bbc arabic between 13 november 2023 and 18 april 2025 qannan appeared 217 times on the channel between 8 february 2024 and the 27 april 2025 alagha appeared 522 times between 21 november 2023 and 26 april 2025 they were consistently introduced to bbc arabic audiences as journalists when the bbc responded to criticism of the use of such people prescott describes how the corporation downplayed their contributions to the channel even claiming they were just eyewitnesses 7 bbc ignored growing concerns about inaccuracy of gazan death toll reporting another review into the bbc coverage of the conflicts death toll prescott says was reported back to the corporations egsc in july 2024 coming after the un revised its own figures to show that the percentage of women and children killed was lower than had been reported hamas who reported these figures based them both on hospital records but also on media reports from the gaza government media office which is also run by hamas prescott wrote that hamas has never explained how this number has been calculated but the majority of deaths from media reports are women and children he said that both the un and multiple media outlets including the bbc had reported that 70 percent of all those killed in gaza were women and childrendespite growing concerns that thismethodology was unreliable he said that the egsc was told that for too long the bbc had given unjustifiable weight to the 70 percent claim even though concerns about its credibility were well known 8 the bbc misreported on mass graves in gaza implying israeli war crimes prescott describes how in both april and june the bbc reported on stories relating to the discovery of mass graves in gaza and that the strong implication in the coverage was that israeli forces had buried hundreds of bodies at both sites prior to withdrawing from the area however the source for both stories was the hamascontrolled gaza civil defence agency this was not reflected in the coverage prescott confirms that the internal report to the bbcs egsc flagged there was no independent corroboration of allegations of war crimes including alleged evidence of summary executions torture and bodies found with their hands tied together one of the bbcs online story had actually incorrectly implied a un official had corroborated the reports of hands being tied prescott says it seems that the most likely explanation was the graves at both hospitals were dug by palestinians and the people buried there had died or been killed prior to the arrival of israel ground forces furthermore he writes the egsc was reminded that the bbc had itself reported extensively on palestinians digging these graves at the time these reports had topped its bulletins how could this then be forgotten in the subsequent bbc coverage that suggested something more sinister had occurred the egsc was offered no explanation the question becomes even more pressing when you learn the journalists responsible for the first set of stories were the same journalists who wrote the second set of stories suggesting the graves were evidence of israeli war crimes executives were presented with the evidence about how badly the bbc had got this wrong but it remains unclear what measures were taken regarding personnel or training 9 the bbc knew a devastating claim about gaza starvation was incorrect they asked an israeli representative on newsnight about it anyway in may 2025 in a now notorious incident the uns under secretary general for humanitarian affairs tom fletcher publicly claimed that 14000 babies in gaza were at risk of starving to death within the next 48 hours if israel did not lift an aid blockade the story gained worldwide attention interestingly it was the bbc itself which found the major discrepancy in what fletcher had said and the truth fletcher had cited an ipc integrated food security phase classification report but what the report had actually said was that 14000 children were at risk of acute malnutrition over the course of a year if the blockade was not lifted the bbc as prescott says updated its online articles accordingly yet he writes despite this fletchers inaccurate claim was put to israels un ambassador danny danon on newsnight why when the bbc knew the suggestion was wrong in that same programme prescott sets out images of a baby siwar ashour were featured ashour suffered from allergies and a congenital condition and required specialist formula by the time of broadcast the bbc already knew the story was out of date and that baby siwar had received the necessary formula a week earlier she was maintaining weight and had been discharged from hospital prescott writes none of that was revealed in the programme meaning the bbc had broadcast another inaccurate story prescott also makes clear that this was not the first or last time the bbc has reported stories about starvation in gaza without telling audiences that the person highlighted has preexisting medical conditions that might explain their emaciated appearance he cited a case from august 2025 when a bbc headline informed readers that a malnutritioned gaza woman flown to italy dies in hospital this version he described was shared around the world only two days later was the headline updated to gaza woman flown to italy dies in hospital it having become clear that she had serious preexisting conditions 10 the icj did not rule that there was a plausible case of genocide in gaza the bbc suggested that it had too many times to count it was in a bbc hardtalk interview that that icjs former president joan donoghue who was on the panel which considered south africas submission against israel to the court clarified that it was not correct to say the icj had ruled there was a plausible case of genocide in gaza a report to the bbcs egsc however flagged numerous instances where the corporation had suggested exactly that prescott said describing it being used on bbc reports analysis and live twoways on both television and radio it was also cited by international editor jeremy bowen and on newsnight he described how the report to the egsc said there were too many instances of the bbc misrepresenting the icjs ruling to be listed in full prescott pointed out that the icj report runs to just 26 pages and was written in nontechnical language had no bbc reporter troubled themselves to read it he said the internal bbc review had concluded that the icj report is very clear and explicitly states that the court is not making any determination on the merits of south africas case the icj said it was only assessing whether what south africa had alleged was potentially covered by the genocide convention the bbc needs to accept it has systemic issues with the coverage in what can best be described as an utterly damning ending to this section of his dossier prescott concludes that the bbc is prone to downplaying criticism by saying it receives similar numbers of complaints from both sides looking at the evidence set out above it seems very hard for any propalestinian observers to make a compelling case the bbc has a proisrael bias claims against israel seem to be raced to air or online without adequate checks evidencing either carelessness or a desire always to believe the worst about israel the errors come thick and fast sometimes with eyewitness testimony from locals who have tweeted in praise of the 7 october killings and worse the bbc needs to accept it has systemic issues with the coverage only then can the
