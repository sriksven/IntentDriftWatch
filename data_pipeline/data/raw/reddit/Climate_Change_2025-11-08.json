    "us taxpayer dollars fuel covert operation to silence pesticide critics a public relations firm vfluence secretly profiled over 3000 organizations and 500 individuals including environmental health journalists scientists and advocates in an effort to undermine global resistance to pesticides and genetically modified crops the operation was partially funded by the us agency for international development the firm created a private social network called bonus eventus accessible to about 1000 members primarily from the agrochemical industry academia and government agencies serving as a repository for detailed profiles that often included sensitive personal information this scandal is part of a longer history of corporate influence and government collusion in the agricultural sector drawing parallels to the monsanto papers which revealed how the agricultural giant had manipulated science and public opinion to protect its profits following exposure vfluence has shut down the bonus eventus platform but questions remain about the potential misuse of personal information and the impact on those profiled the firm and its leader jay byrne are named as codefendants in a lawsuit against syngenta the manufacturer of paraquat a highly toxic herbicide linked to parkinsons disease environmental and health advocates are calling for a thorough investigation and stricter regulations to prevent such abuses of power in the future emphasizing the ongoing need for vigilance in safeguarding the integrity of scientific research and public discourse in a chilling revelation that echoes cold warera paranoia it has come to light that a public relations firm vfluence secretly profiled over 3000 organizations and 500 individuals including environmental health journalists scientists and advocates in a concerted effort to undermine global resistance to pesticides and genetically modified gm crops the operation funded in part by the us agency for international development usaid has now been shut down following widespread public outcry and media scrutiny the dark side of bonus eventus vfluence led by jay byrne a former communications director at monsanto created a private social network called bonus eventus named after the roman god of agriculture this shadowy platform accessible to about 1000 members primarily from the agrochemical industry academia and government agencies served as a clandestine repository of detailed profiles these profiles often included sensitive personal information such as home addresses phone numbers and even the names and house values of family members its a clear violation of privacy and a fundamental attack on the principles of democratic discourse said arthur grimonpont of reporters without borders this kind of manipulation is designed to silence voices that challenge the status quo and should be condemned in the strongest possible terms a legacy of corporate influence and government collusion the revelation of vfluences activities is not an isolated incident but part of a longer history of corporate influence and government collusion in the agricultural sector in the 1980s and 1990s similar tactics were used by tobacco companies to downplay the health risks of smoking more recently the fossil fuel industry has been accused of funding think tanks and advocacy groups to cast doubt on climate change science the current scandal draws parallels to the monsanto papers a trove of internal documents that revealed how the agricultural giant had manipulated science and public opinion to protect its profits the documents showed that monsanto had ghostwritten scientific papers funded favorable research and attacked critics who raised concerns about the safety of its products particularly the herbicide roundup the people who run vfluence should search their consciences and ask themselves how the organization serves society and humankind said professor michael antoniou a geneticist whose work on the safety of gm crops has been repeatedly targeted their sole purpose seems to be to undermine the honest work of individuals and organizations whose aim is to research and educate about the risks posed by gmos and pesticides the aftermath legal and ethical questions abound following the exposure of vfluences activities by the guardian and other media partners the company has made significant staff cuts and shut down the bonus eventus platform however the damage has already been done and many of those profiled remain concerned about the potential misuse of their personal information those of us who were profiled still do not know who accessed the information and how it was used antoniou added did it hinder us in our careers or close doors that otherwise may have been open to us the fact that vfluence and the industries it serves resorted to these underhanded methods shows that they were unable to win on the level of the science moreover vfluence and byrne are named as codefendants in a lawsuit against syngenta the manufacturer of paraquat a highly toxic herbicide linked to parkinsons disease the lawsuit alleges that vfluence helped syngenta suppress information about the health risks of paraquat and neutralize its critics a call to action the shutdown of vfluences profiling operation is a significant victory for transparency and accountability but the broader issue of corporate influence in policymaking remains a pressing concern environmental and health advocates are calling for a thorough investigation and stricter regulations to prevent such abuses of power in the future the practice of profiling and spreading rumors that could harm journalists integrity should never be allowed to flourish in a democratic state grimonpont emphasized a thorough investigation must be conducted to bring to justice all those involved in these outrageous violations of privacy and the reputation of environmental journalists as the dust settles the vfluence scandal serves as a stark reminder of the ongoing need for vigilance in safeguarding the integrity of scientific research and public discourse the fight against corporate influence and government collusion is far from over and the voices of those advocating for a safer more sustainable future must continue to be heard",

    "we have no hr confused on expectations idk how to navigate this stuff i was given feedback by my manager a month ago to not be so friendly which i dont think im too friendly he thought i was being too personal with people asked me to reflect on my words actions because in a short time period i reported to ethics a racist comment another manager made as well as two associates having relations on the clock both got fired both were managers involved with regular associates im a manager btw he asked how im getting wrapped up into things or why people feel comfortable enough to talk to me about these things i truly dont know people have always told me wild shit since i was young i even set verbal boundaries people just shrug me off i dont know what im doing wrong i want to throw in here i dont reveal anything about my life or personal stuff except for the fact im in college i have cats im on a strict diet due to my weight loss journey i spoke with management about my recent family emergency these are things that have came up during small talk i do not speak or hang out with anyone outside of work i have always kept that boundary because it was apart of my training when i was a store leader with another company i excelled in im naturally investigative i have extreme pattern recognition i know when employees are doing wrong things this doesnt mean i snitch on everyone only when it affects the workflow or my ability to maintain an inclusivesafefair environment however as a manager the last thing i want to do is have half of my team myself work 10x as hard because a manager our associate is smoking weed making out on the clock in a car in the parking lot for an hour last thing i want is for another manager to make a racist comment which leads to one of our associates bursting into tears leaving work early because english isnt her first language she simply dont understand what the manager on duty was requesting of her i explained these things to my manager who gave me this feedback but he still looped me back to people being too comfortable with me idk how its my fault or howwhy i come off that way because he wasnt specific here i am today i had perfect attendance since starting this job in march always a half hour early to greet everyone read emails before jumping in to my tasks in the last 2 weeks ive called off twice was late twice all of a sudden i just feel so stressed out sick after that feedback my manager gave me ive taken it seriously anytime someone comes to me with something that doesnt immediately compromise safety i shut it down very firmly because i take accountability that neurotypicals might see me as being overly friendly idk but this has now led to the team not trusting me treating me with indifference the energy has shifted my mom had a heart attack two weeks ago i begged to leave early to be with her the manager on duty who couldve taken over the keys was an hour late which if she wasnt i couldve left a half an hr early which was good enough for me i called called the other managers long story short i ended up working ot despite my emergency not even a good morning or an apology when they came in either tonight i worked with a girl who is the same management level as me who leaves often because shes tired which i dont care because i know im capable of getting the job done short staffed or not im tired too a lot so i dont blame her because all of us have different thresholds however tonight she told me i could leave early because we were overstaffed i was gracious of this because truly im so worn down i was up 12 hours before going to work which i work 10 hour shifts didnt sleep well the night before due to stress being sick with a sinus infection i was estatic however right after telling me i could leave she suddenly had to leave because our upper manager went to another job site when he clocked out when i came into work got punched at another store he visited ive been picking up on the two of them for weeks they are both married but are likely seeing each other because the girl spills too many hints from my pattern recognition i believe he got into a fight with another associate that was hitting on her however of course i have turned a blind eye to it all trying to respect the feedback from my manager keep my blinders on i dont care try not to let it affect me again i dont care if they are together im scared the bias this dynamic will affect me she is all about drama i feel like i have to agree with her because she is highly emotional ive noticed the few times i didnt agree she changes her entire persona towards me for the rest of shift anyways i texted her asking if she would be back to work just to set my own expectations if i can still leave early or not no reply because she left it in the air then two hours later the manager that apparently got punched called the store to tell me she would be back after dropping him off at the hospital she gets back shes instantly hostile towards me face red wont hardly speak i ask her if everything is okay she ignores me i tell her i dont mind still working she basically pressures me to still leave early everyone else on the clock treats me different as soon as she walked in too no joking or laughing or friendly conversation like usual all except for one girl i feel like this was wildly unprofessional annoying the girl that left also texted me yesterday while i was off the clock about drama but never provided context saying someone was calling for me trying to start shit but wouldnt say why when i asked her this made me anxious all night wondering what i did wrong or who it was someone please give me feedback i feel like this is going to fall back on me again tomorrow anytime i mention problems im treated like im the problem or that im a sensitive flower cant handle stuff i dont care if they have a relationship what i care about is my level of respect how these things impact my job nobody respected me when i had a genuine family emergency im not trying to have a lack of empathy if our manager truly got punched but also hes a grown man starting fights at other stores whos married i dont understand why someone else in his life couldnt have came to his rescue i dont understand why their business needs to impede on my job i dont understand why when i have legitimate reasons to leave im always thrown on the back burner treated different can someone help me out here im sure ill get a talking to tomorrow my stomach hurts so bad she told me i could leave but when i actually left i didnt say anything because she made me feel so uncomfortable due to her hostility so im scared shes going to frame it as i walked out the manager that got punched has a say in my employmentwrite ups ect im so sad because i really like this job too theres just so many emotional components to this its hard to navigate im scared ill get fired because im the odd one out it feels like nobody seems to see things from my perspective at all ive been a store leader at another job before this for 8 years straight mind you im only 24 handling much larger mental loads during my time there however i had greater amounts of support from management my peers where we had a structured way of handling these things it was against policy to have these personal relations or biases towards other employees especially as a higher manager hr would shut it down immediately or consequences ensue at my current job the feedback i received from that manager a month ago was the only feedback ive received at all since starting work in march i just feel stagnant so maybe my brain expects the same thing at my current place of employment i want to fit in so bad besides my poor attendance of this past week im perfect on paper but it feels like im failing if i join the drama my team likes me but my managers dont if i stay out of it my team turns on me i feel like a black sheep some of the managers like me some still dont i guess im seeking validation common experiences even advice if anyone else can share im desperate im so stressed im scared im going to lose my job which i cant afford in this current economical climate but i cant just keep hanging my head low being treated some type of way i feel lost",

    "workplace dramaissues not sure how to navigate advice i was given feedback by my manager a month ago to not be so friendly which i dont think im too friendly he thought i was being too personal with people asked me to reflect on my words actions because in a short time period i reported to ethics a racist comment another manager made as well as two associates having relations on the clock both got fired both were managers involved with regular associates im a manager btw he asked how im getting wrapped up into things or why people feel comfortable enough to talk to me about these things i truly dont know people have always told me wild shit since i was young i even set verbal boundaries people just shrug me off i dont know what im doing wrong i want to throw in here i dont reveal anything about my life or personal stuff except for the fact im in college i have cats im on a strict diet due to my weight loss journey i spoke with management about my recent family emergency these are things that have came up during small talk i do not speak or hang out with anyone outside of work i have always kept that boundary because it was apart of my training when i was a store leader with another company i excelled in im naturally investigative i have extreme pattern recognition i know when employees are doing wrong things this doesnt mean i snitch on everyone only when it affects the workflow or my ability to maintain an inclusivesafefair environment however as a manager the last thing i want to do is have half of my team myself work 10x as hard because a manager our associate is smoking weed making out on the clock in a car in the parking lot for an hour last thing i want is for another manager to make a racist comment which leads to one of our associates bursting into tears leaving work early because english isnt her first language she simply dont understand what the manager on duty was requesting of her i explained these things to my manager who gave me this feedback but he still looped me back to people being too comfortable with me idk how its my fault or howwhy i come off that way because he wasnt specific here i am today i had perfect attendance since starting this job in march always a half hour early to greet everyone read emails before jumping in to my tasks in the last 2 weeks ive called off twice was late twice all of a sudden i just feel so stressed out sick after that feedback my manager gave me ive taken it seriously anytime someone comes to me with something that doesnt immediately compromise safety i shut it down very firmly because i take accountability that neurotypicals might see me as being overly friendly idk but this has now led to the team not trusting me treating me with indifference the energy has shifted my mom had a heart attack two weeks ago i begged to leave early to be with her the manager on duty who couldve taken over the keys was an hour late which if she wasnt i couldve left a half an hr early which was good enough for me i called called the other managers long story short i ended up working ot despite my emergency not even a good morning or an apology when they came in either tonight i worked with a girl who is the same management level as me who leaves often because shes tired which i dont care because i know im capable of getting the job done short staffed or not im tired too a lot so i dont blame her because all of us have different thresholds however tonight she told me i could leave early because we were overstaffed i was gracious of this because truly im so worn down i was up 12 hours before going to work which i work 10 hour shifts didnt sleep well the night before due to stress being sick with a sinus infection i was estatic however right after telling me i could leave she suddenly had to leave because our upper manager went to another job site when he clocked out when i came into work got punched at another store he visited ive been picking up on the two of them for weeks they are both married but are likely seeing each other because the girl spills too many hints from my pattern recognition i believe he got into a fight with another associate that was hitting on her however of course i have turned a blind eye to it all trying to respect the feedback from my manager keep my blinders on i dont care try not to let it affect me again i dont care if they are together im scared the bias this dynamic will affect me she is all about drama i feel like i have to agree with her because she is highly emotional ive noticed the few times i didnt agree she changes her entire persona towards me for the rest of shift anyways i texted her asking if she would be back to work just to set my own expectations if i can still leave early or not no reply because she left it in the air then two hours later the manager that apparently got punched called the store to tell me she would be back after dropping him off at the hospital she gets back shes instantly hostile towards me face red wont hardly speak i ask her if everything is okay she ignores me i tell her i dont mind still working she basically pressures me to still leave early everyone else on the clock treats me different as soon as she walked in too no joking or laughing or friendly conversation like usual all except for one girl i feel like this was wildly unprofessional annoying the girl that left also texted me yesterday while i was off the clock about drama but never provided context saying someone was calling for me trying to start shit but wouldnt say why when i asked her this made me anxious all night wondering what i did wrong or who it was someone please give me feedback i feel like this is going to fall back on me again tomorrow anytime i mention problems im treated like im the problem or that im a sensitive flower cant handle stuff i dont care if they have a relationship what i care about is my level of respect how these things impact my job nobody respected me when i had a genuine family emergency im not trying to have a lack of empathy if our manager truly got punched but also hes a grown man starting fights at other stores whos married i dont understand why someone else in his life couldnt have came to his rescue i dont understand why their business needs to impede on my job i dont understand why when i have legitimate reasons to leave im always thrown on the back burner treated different can someone help me out here im sure ill get a talking to tomorrow my stomach hurts so bad she told me i could leave but when i actually left i didnt say anything because she made me feel so uncomfortable due to her hostility so im scared shes going to frame it as i walked out the manager that got punched has a say in my employmentwrite ups ect im so sad because i really like this job too theres just so many emotional components to this its hard to navigate im scared ill get fired because im the odd one out it feels like nobody seems to see things from my perspective at all ive been a store leader at another job before this for 8 years straight mind you im only 24 handling much larger mental loads during my time there however i had greater amounts of support from management my peers where we had a structured way of handling these things it was against policy to have these personal relations or biases towards other employees especially as a higher manager hr would shut it down immediately or consequences ensue at my current job the feedback i received from that manager a month ago was the only feedback ive received at all since starting work in march i just feel stagnant so maybe my brain expects the same thing at my current place of employment i want to fit in so bad besides my poor attendance of this past week im perfect on paper but it feels like im failing if i join the drama my team likes me but my managers dont if i stay out of it my team turns on me i feel like a black sheep some of the managers like me some still dont i guess im seeking validation common experiences even advice if anyone else can share im desperate im so stressed im scared im going to lose my job which i cant afford in this current economical climate but i cant just keep hanging my head low being treated some type of way i feel lost",

    "we need to talk about youth politics in singapore singapore media dsa bullying jc mergers all schools are good schools mental health well im back with more postsyes even after one yesterday lol yes another one less than 2 weeks after my last one i guess i just feel kinda inspired after some recent events and felt that i needed to let my thoughts out through here haha just a short disclaimer before going forward ill try to be as nonpartisan as possible here given the nature of this post that said im definitely not perfect and some of my biases will definitely be evident here that said ill try my absolute best to stay politically neutral and objective and neither oppose nor endorse any political parties listed tldr youth even in singapore do have the power to inspire political change and change in general if were more politically engaged context this kinda starts all the way back at the start of the year when i came across an ig reel from then new york city assembly member zohran mamdani running for the democratic nomination for city mayor as i continued watching more and more reels from him i realised how much he tried to appeal to younger first time voters by not only advocating for policies popular with youths and first time voters like free bus rides and rent freezes but also stayed relevant with popular reels and online content that attracted such first time voters after that day i followed his story and rise to fame closely from his poll defying win during the primary to his eventual win this wednesday even i personally woke up early that day to watch the election results live and got so happy when he won by 9 points there were so many emotions running through me pride joy elation but at the bottom of it all curiosity according to ap news mamdani performed overwhelmingly with first time voters and young voters younger than 30 have politicians in singapore done the same to appeal to youth voters and could a mamdani type arise here under the right conditions during the next general election youths primary concerns according to ntuc youth the 4 main concerns of youths today here in singapore are 1 financial worries and overall uncertainty 2 mental health online 3 family problems 4 sexual violence a keen eye might notice that the most prominent issues that youths face currently are an increasingly difficult financial landscape and if you observed this years general election the top issue addressed by parties and candidates across the board are cost of living issues thats not to say the rest of these issues can somewhat be helped by government policies as well this goes to show that many of what singaporean youth desire and are concerned about can be addressed and helped with through politicians and thus a government that serves their needs and especially since political awareness and even engagement is on the rise thanks to social media engaging with youths as a voting bloc is becoming more important than ever even though the voting age in singapore is at the high 21 years old so what has been done to engage with students and thus youths as a whole youth politics in singapore first most established political parties in singapore have youth wings of their parties these are basically avenues for these parties to engage with youth voters and allow youths to volunteer with their parties the most prominent examples are the youth pap which regularly engages with youths and younger voters on their most important issues for those more interested in opposition politics theres the sdp young democrats which were recently involved in crafting a policy roadmap to follow for future general elections and the workers party holds the biennial youth conference which aims to bring together youth volunteers and interested youth voters alike secondly even in the most recent general election major parties have made major strides in attempting to appeal to youth and first time voters as mentioned earlier most political candidates during the last general election proposed policies that aimed to alleviate the cost of living crisis which as mentioned was the primary concern of youthand most voters heading to the general election not only that but some political parties even go as far as to propose policies that are directly relevant to students as a whole in singapore the main example of this is the workers party proposal for later school start times to allow students to have more needed sleep why are youth not getting involved firstly is that some youth are simply disinterested in politics think about it how many of the people you know actively debate politics or even kept up with this years election most students do not regularly debate or talk about singaporean politics to each other and its easy to see why with most students and thus youths more concerned for studying for their exams and other hobbies its easy to disregard politics here especially since they have little stake furthermore even attempts to integrate local political awareness to the syllabus such as social studies english and gp overall did not do well to inspire students to research more into politics if anything many view these subjects as a burden given the multiple complaints about the humanities and ss in particular as well as gp secondly some youth feel pressured to not partake in it especially due to the paps electoral dominance the pap has repeatedly dominated every single election since independence even during the 2025 general election the pap gained vote share to 6557 which is a vast increase from their 6124 in 2020 such electoral dominance has various effects namely that youth who prefer opposition policies over those proposed by the establishment may see no purpose in properly engaging with local politics given that the pap is likely to win regardless which is especially true in smcs or grcs which are not held by opposition parties why should the average student get involved well the answer here is extremely simple youth and thus all of us here are the future of this country each and every one of us here has a role to play in singapores future even if it may not seem so now we are responsible for the development and growth of our country we are responsible for taking care of an ever ageing population here and for the guys especially were responsible for the defense of our country as well as such it is imperative that our needs and concerns are addressed by those in power even if we dont have the right to vote just yet yes even if your desired policies are best seen in opposition parties its still important to engage with the established government as well as thats the only way they can be made aware of the issues facing youths here today opinion what should be done to engage more with voters and how can youths engage more one especially those more so engaged in opposition politics might just easily propose that the pap establishment allow opposition parties more opportunities to compete such as through more proportionate distribution of time during televised debates or even through more fair redistricting this would theoretically encourage more to engage in politics even if they are far out from the but this simply isnt possible in my opinion given the sheer landslide that the pap has won year after year it is unlikely for the opposition to make significant gains at least to the threshold to block constitutional amendments furthermore it can also be argued that political parties are already doing what they can to engage with younger voters for instance many mps already frequently engage with the local community taking part in local events and create online content inspired by their gen z staff as such it can also be argued that many in power are already doing as much as they can to so what can be done instead well the onus has to be on the youth themselves yes we should become more politically engaged with the happenings of singaporean politics but how could the average youth do so firstly for those who are extremely keen on joining a political party early on most established political parties have aforementioned youth wings that are open for volunteers volunteering for a political party can make one more aware of the issues in society today and is generally a great avenue to find friends and connect with politicians early on the main downside of doing so however is being affiliated to a political party early on and that many political parties have minimum ages to volunteer the pap being 17 and the workers party at 18 respectively secondly and whats far more feasible for many students and youth is to simply keep up with the latest parliamentary debates for instance cna frequently covers parliamentary debates as they go with important talking points being shared in their articles keeping up with whats relevant in the government today boosts ones understanding of the society around them not just that but asking questions on what was being debated and conducting civil discussions with those around you can help bring about awareness on these issues as well conclusion so given what ive mentioned here could a politician like mamdani someone who is apt in engaging with younger voters with youth centric policies and viral social media outreach rise in singapore personally given how the political climate is like we likely wont get a one to one copy of mamdani with the exact same policies however a candidate which aims to connect with youth through advocating for their interests like mental health awareness and financial worries online and reaching the algorithm can definitely be possible as social media becomes more vital to politicians to garner votes i feel its likely that many politicians even those in singapore might want to increase their presence online given the power of social media seen in mamdanis win but whats more important than any one individual candidate is our attitude to accept and demand for change through the proper channels from joining and volunteering for political parties the peoples association or even small things like reading up on the latest political developments every step helps to create a more politically conscious youth which can thus make their voices and votes heard when the elections come by so yes every small step counts towards crafting a better future for us all but with that im curious what are your opinions on youth political engagement in singapore and what can be done to make politics more appealing for more to take part in closing and thats the end of yet another post as you could probably tell this post was heavily inspired by mamdanis win in new york on wednesday and plus ive always wanted to tackle civil discourse and politics through this series as well and i felt like his win was the best time to do so anyways with os ending and as ongoing all the best in your exams",

nomads for a pack of cigarettes when he was 4 that he joined the army in mid2002 to fight in the 2nd central american war by 2003 he had lost a friend that had saved his life in combat lost an arm and deserted the military along with many others my headcanon robert john linder was born in college station tx on november 16th 1986 1 young johnnys mom was young herself in late 1985 she had in her 17yearold wisdom told her family to fuggoff and ran away to a town far far away full of pretty pretty boys by february 1986 she found herself pregnant in college station johnnys soontobe dad decided he needed to get his shit together to support this little family he had made and enrolled at the local university which also happened to be the largest nonstatesponsored military academy in the world johnnys dad threw himself into figuring out how to manage just enough college to keep in the rotc program whilst running himself ragged and neglecting his girlfriend and his sonand he smoked a lot his father died of lung cancer shortly after johnnys fourth birthday his mother alone with no support network and a 4yearold child was forced to reconcile with her family all the while 4yearold johnny is dealing with losing his hero soldier father this impression was mostly in johnnys mind but his age ensured that the impression was deep johnnys mom moves back to the hills and sticks of eastern oklahoma where she grew up probably around sallisaw or pocola this is in early 1991 johnny spent the next 3 years figuring out what this new life is all about and not liking all the sharp social edges that tore at the way his father had trained his mind to work 2 he took up one of his cousins guitars to escape from the redneck hillbilly hell that gnawed at his ego the world went to shit after the crash of 94 what that meant for the hillbillies of the ozarks and the ouachitas was that if you wanted to do business with texas you had to fight your way through the gauntlets they set up along i44 i35 i40 and i20 rumor has it that the coonasses closed down i10 too 3 these people who would go on to become a part of the mythological incarnation that came to be called nomad clans had shot out onto the desertified plains from springfield missouri to tyler and the outskirts of dallas they survived by raiding the highways the fuggin mad max pirates of america had their first goaround with the us forces trying to enforce the federal martial law decree out of mcconnell vance tinker and altus air force bases and the armor from forts sill and leonard wood johnny got a front row seat to watch his grandfather lead these pos punk motherfuggers in a noholdsbarred throwdown with the us military all across the crosstimbers 4 the american sahel by this point there was the raid on the enormous ammunition factory in mcalester and the doomed raid on the wolf creek nuclear plant in the spring of 2002 that saw johnnys mother mortally wounded blaming his grandfather for his mothers death and possessed with a rage learned from years of scraping by on the edge of civilization johnny cast off this counterfeit identity that his mothers horrible family had molded him into to follow that gleaming glorious honorable path that his 4yearold mind imagined his father had been on in the buildup for the second central american war which broke out in january 2003 johnny hotwired the first ride he could find to get his ass across the red river and into a recruiting station it didnt matter that he was underage he already had a beardenoughand they needed him 5 once the us diverted resources to central america the resistance to the nomad expansion disappeared they became a known quantity throughout the world the american cowboy reborn once yondu threatened a young peter quill that the crew would eat you were it not for yondus intervention a trauma reinforced sense of dependence johnnys grandpa tried to dissociate johnny from his dad by joking that johnnys dad had sold him to the nomads for a pack of cigarettes maybe less graceful than obiwans very similar lie it was true from a certain point of view how do i know thats a bs line in the immortal and timeline divergence immune words of bob saget marijuana is not a drug i used to suck dick for coke now thats an addiction you ever suck some dick for marijuana nobody is going to sell a child for a pack cigarettes but if you want your 5yearold grandchild to forsake that part of himself that he had to leave behind i can guess thats what he came up with 6 by the time he was telling his buddies in the army it was a funny joke then the not funny thing happened johnny got his arm blown off in a battle that took his best friends life while in recovery the real story behind the war set in for johnny the political desperation to mobilize people to shore up national support for the faltering government that he had believed in the pervasive intrusion of the militaryindustrial complex bent on stoking conflict and ultimately suffering for no better reason than profit it left johnny desperately conflicted between the shining sigil held forth by the memory of his father and the fugg erebody attitude imparted on him by his mother and grandfather a month after deserting from the va johhny was on the balcony of a hotel in pacifica screaming at the universe for a path forward hearing nothing johnny figured that the only path to walk then was his own the only way he knew to walk it was the path he had followed to survive this fugged upside down world the rebel path im certain that it was less than coincidence that samurais first gig was at the red dirt 1 i can believe that johnny lied to get into the military at 16 nearly 17 hes an exceptionally rare specimen that can hang with an infantry company at 15 2 the special dissonance that connects the larger texhoma region from wichita to austin is balanced on a pass through two of the oldest mountain ranges left on earth the wichita and ouachita ranges where all that is green and good lie to the south and all that is otherwise unattached stretches out northward like a nice porch its quite nice but its not the house the mangy runt thats tolerated because its part of the pack but is constantly reminded that its the mangy runt its a large chip on many shoulders 3 texas would have become economically isolated to some degree the inability of the federal government to keep the highways open and viable consistently would have isolated texas to some degree likely informing the decision to leave the us a situation not unlike the borders of between england and scotland before james vi became james i kinda the same people too 4 an oak savannah between the eastern forests and the great plains some of the oldest growth forest in the usonly because it has almost no economic value 5 i practically dove into the uniform 6 afterall my own grandfather lifted himself up on his last hospital bed at the ringing of my uncles cell phone to inform

    "prologue of epica chapter 1 the planck epoch imagine a sentient world a universe capable of thought and feeling at his birth time and space were created and his expansion began from a singular hot point there was one unified force until he began to cool for billions of years he remained comatose unknowing of his own existence the universe was beginning its infancy and as things began to settle he gained sentience much like a baby becoming selfaware his body was the universe though he was able to explore his own reaches through a concentrated avatar from pure thought his avatar being made of his consciousness allowed him to transport himself across the universe in mere moments though he wasnt omnipresent his body was proportional to that of anyone elses one may not know what happens with every single cell in their body but possesses a general awareness oriion had a general awareness of how large he was and the forces that existed within him realizing he was alive billions of years into existence came an innate yearning to make up for the time lost at the moment of his awakening he did what any young being sprawled into a new world would do venture throughout his explorations he mostly saw an indescribable emptiness nothing persisted but eventually he saw fantastic celestial objects he numbered each of them until he lost count he observed planets and noted their features he saw the dust of nebulae collapse into burning stars he studied how each particle interacted with each other and started gaining an understanding of elements as time progressed he began assessing the threshold of his own power he discovered that he possessed the ability to move the objects in his own universal body with ease manipulate forces like gravity and electromagnetism influence the local laws of physics and possess a general omniscience of what happens within his cosmos with these abilities came an innate understanding to conduct this power with due regard this understanding would influence his interactions in the future chapter 2 the archean age throughout his travels hed make contact with the first signs of life on a planet designated terras in a star system located in the outer edges of the universe terras existed as a larger teal planet with strong gravity the climate was harsh with diamond rain and snow storms being a common occurrence it had an icy surface but was warm enough to host life that originated in caves terras resided in the habitable zone of its star system and possessed a thick atmosphere rich in alien elements the planets colossal mass allowed its atmosphere to persist furthermore a magnetic field protected terras from cosmic radiation which allowed its early lifeforms to evolve at a given pace with ease since terras bears a strong gravitational force its lifeforms evolved to be shorter in size for the ancestors of the terrakin the protokin that meant their general heights would be up to 4 feet in stature until theyd grow taller as they evolved as they originated in caves to keep warm they fed on lesser cave beings like terracytes and terrafins which are the aquatic life found in caves or their oceans when they became more civilized and technological theyd farm on mudgrain or geofruit which would eventually become their general sources of energy prior to their advancements they sported a short frame but robust body they possessed four limbs like a humanoid which was effective for traveling long distances and handling tools they were a unique classification of life adorned with silver colored skin that was thick enough for traversing rough terrain the strongest of the protokin had the strength to punch up to two tons which was useful for getting boulders out of the way protokin had poor eyesight due to the dark caves they dwelled in but in turn they were able to sense infrared and gravity fields as time passed most would lose those senses as they adapted to other climates climates they wouldnt have ventured in if not for the help of oriion himself he first made contact with them in their early beginnings exploring the desolate parts of terras oriion was perplexed at seeing life for the first time he was used to the abiotic characteristics of all the objects he observed but not the biotic ones for the first time he realized he wasnt alone and at that moment he felt the sentiment of solace of course in the perspective of the protokin they initially feared his looming avatar he would shorten his avatar in size so that they would be more familiar with them as if he were one of them and would go on to take the form of a humanoid as oriion observed them they became more familiar with him they saw similarities in him and began to trust him more oriion helped them in their endeavors to expand their populations as there were a mere several thousand of them at the time any severe weather that occurred near them oriion would merely cast away not only that he would reshape the planet to be more suitable for biodiversity readjusting its orbit and manipulating their homestars magnetic field so that it may last longer this allowed the protokin to be fruitful and flourish oriion would go on to show them what hed learn of the universe like a cosmic guide he helped them discover new foods like geofruit and mudgrain to expand their diets geofruit in particular was a specialized fruit created by crystallike plants rooted deep in the soil that siphoned energy from geothermal sources its mere nutrients slowly changed the physiology of the protokins over time via its own biochemicals unlocking a gene which allowed them to possess unique abilities amongst themselves protokins would exhibit different traits and started becoming more dissimilar from one another one protokins gene allowed them to possess super strength that allowed them to punch with 10 tons of force others genes allowed them to run at faster speeds up to 200 mph the gene would become the staple of modern terrakins and their uniqueness amongst other species and as centuries passed oriion and the protokin learned together the protokin steadily changed but oriion remained stagnant he led their people into new territories and ages leading them on expeditions across terras building them structures and sharing knowledge about the universe with them oriion brought resources and foreign samples that they could analyze for him while oriion would venture to find more studying them gave further insight into local biology physics chemistry cosmology and the overall science of oriion their numbers would steadily grow and they would utilize crystalline structures used for shelter and advanced machinery that allowed for transportation health and more advanced versions of spaceships wormhole generators and space suits were used to traverse the cosmos oriion with the help of the protokin would develop language that would later on to become universal amongst all species that inhabited oriion with all the knowledge oriion had gained since allying with the protokin came abrupt oblivion new information would replace old information and oriion would therein experience the plight of forgetfulness which typically posed an issue with many creatures possessing the characteristic of longevity as oriion forgot things the protokin soon noted them down for him which would in turn become the catalyst that forms the archives of oriion this was a colossal database that stored information and secrets only known to that of oriion himself oriion entrusted a select number of genius and wise people with his erudition designating them as members of the council of oriion chapter 3 the stelliferous era the council of oriion is the most intelligent beings chosen to moderate oriion the protokin realized that oriion possessed godlike power and some of them worried that he may abuse it in the future in a coup against them to ensure their trust oriion established the council so that they may manage any major decision in truth the council knew there was no way to truly enforce any edicts onto oriion but as long as oriion complied he would be in good graces with the protokin which was always subject to change oriion respects the council so that they may respect him he treats them as his leader even if he may not agree with them from time to time even if he could theoretically destroy them at any given whim factions of the protokin wanted oriion to leave them to their own destinies while most others welcomed his aid since oriion assigned the council the responsibility to safeguard all of his buried knowledge this would lend more credence to oriions loyalty to the protokin oriion transported an exoplanet from a nearby sector and placed it within the orbit of the terras system this planet would be known as sophus which stored the database for the archives of oriion and was heavily guarded by the council with this being established the process of delegating the members of the council of oriion included examinations that evaluated their intellect in regards to biology physics and science in general as the protokin evolved into the terrakin they spread their influence to intergalactic scales with the help of oriion they ventured through the universe and soon found more life after more exploration there were the etherians of etheria who were capable of absorbing lightning as energy then there were the gaians of gaia who lived on a supercontinent of a green planet they made contact with more intelligent societies and offered them a haven on their newly terraformed home planet previously known as terras now known as nexus cultures and communities throughout the cosmos were accepted into the protection of the terrakin and oriion with the dawn of this new age rising came new tensions accusations of speciesism became common seeing that oriion spent most of his time lending aid to the terrakin for centuries whilst races such as the etherians were left to their own crises like the deadly electric storms that nearly brought their kind to extinction oriion would frequently refute these allegations citing that he was unaware of the existence of foreign life yet many would doubt his responses he would ultimately embody contrition for not coming to the aid of the new species sooner to foreign species the terrakin were seen as coddled their civilization had a head start as opposed to others despite this notion the terrakin would regard it with high esteem extraterrestrials began populating nexus and it became the home planet for many species though as societies merged came new rules of law the mission of the council is referred to as two duties reduce suffering and promote felicity the council of oriion has determined that these unique endeavors be prohibited time travel via reversing and forwarding time other than the typical process of its linear progression towards the future is forbidden to ensure proper stability of the spacetime continuum seeing as most of the council are not familiar with the subject nor its prospective outcomes bioengineering in any sense which includes but is not limited to interspecies breeding cloning and gene editing is forbidden to ensure no one can abuse its capabilities artificial intelligence whether lesser or of superior intellect is forbidden to ensure that no reasoning entity may be enslaved nor have their capabilities be abused mass surveillance via observing intelligent lifeforms without their expressed consent or strict understanding of the party being there is forbidden though is mainly applied to oriion himself resurrection of any dead lifeform is forbidden unless naturally caused to ensure the veneration and inviolability of the dead finally physical harm outside of defense which includes but is not limited to murder is forbidden to ensure the reduction of suffering across all forms of life these are the current forbidden acts that all species under the protection of oriion and the council must abide by certain subsets of endeavors are also prohibited interspecies relationships promote offspring of hybrid origin and so this act is deemed as bioengineering and therefore barred indubitably many lifeforms disregard this particular prohibited activity due to emotional interests typically those relationships are made secret so as to not be made subject to punitive action there are exemptions in regards to few rules in which the council typically vote in which situation the prohibited activities may be used if it can contribute to the mission of reducing suffering and promoting felicity or if the perceived subsets of certain prohibited activities do not fall under the definition of said prohibited activity computers and probes contain information but do not fall under the definition of artificial intelligence which is of mere sentient intelligence regardless of rules most living beings strive for pleasure this collective effort requires a focused organization that may enforce these values and so this would be the beginnings of venturia prime these would become the heroes defenders and explorers of oriion chapter 4 the diamond age venturians are typically assigned to protect life explore unknown territories and recruit new venturians these assignments make it so that oriion isnt the only one to carry out these operations and may delegate time to more prioritized duties the council prefers to keep advanced technology out of the hands of venturians and commonfolk but will allow it in certain conditions such as for language translators life suits or super ships their reasoning is that revolutionary technology could potentially be abused generally speaking rules are not utilized in the effort to enforce order but rather a guideline which is to reduce suffering if someone under venturian rule purposefully performs a decision that leads to suffering they may be subject to punishment after a report is filed for the innumerable amount of duties tasked to the venturians are where trials are required new recruits are poised to undergo tests to determine their limits whether that be if they can survive the vacuum of space and for how long cope with extreme temperatures ranging from cold to hot withstand cosmic radiation endure physical forces or resist the overloading of senses depending on how they fare they will be given missions that they may or may not accept depending on the scale of their strengths and weaknesses after theyve earned the title of venturian they will undergo irregular competitions to further determine their levels of power whether these championships are held annually quarterly or daily as well as the amount members of the championship are at the discretion of the council of oriion these championships will determine who may be the strongest venturian among them all and those strongest will be referred to as the adventurians these members are held to the highest regard of venturia prime and interact with the council of oriion much often they will be considered for the most crucial missions those who choose to quit will not be punished but are typically looked down on by other venturians these championships require immense space so that collateral damage will be minimized therefore the colossal sand planet designated xerath would be placed in the terras system by oriion himself it would be one of many planets added to the terras system with the ark planets joining in to be continued",

    "what is the purpose of barnaby joyce barnaby joyce has always talked a story about himself bigger than the brim on his hopalong cassidy hat he is a oneman plot line but his achievements for the people he professes to represent are slim to infinitesimal even joyces former campaign manager mayor of tamworth russell webb told local television barnaby cant get anything done somehow he is being rewarded for all this his threats to leave the nationals have put him in the headlines he so adores and helped end his partys commitment to net zero in the process hes possibly destroyed the coalition rarely has a man of such little substance had so much consequence if joyce makes good on his promise and leaves politics at the next election what would it mean for the people of new england and for australian politics more broadly in my view it is good news for new england there is no doubt the joyce brand has resonated with many particularly his antiparty party stance and there has been plenty of colour and movement to distract people on the ground however very little has been happening in the seat since he was elected in 2013 he has always been more interested in politics than people and new england was just a runway to ambition next to no infrastructure has been built in the electorate in the past decade other than the illthoughtout relocation of the australian pesticides and veterinary medicines authority to armidale the man who promised to build 100 dams has built net zero in fact the only real infrastructure changes and the jobs that go with them have been renewable energy projects dismissed and denigrated by joyce as eyesores and factories with little social licence these renewable projects have become a major part of the rationale joyce uses to explain his estrangement from the nationals he claims he must act to stop this scourge moving across the landscape to protect farmland of course the sentiment is wrongheaded but its also hypocritical thats joyces two modes in one position his criticism of renewable projects stands in stark contrast to his inaction on santoss coal seam gas developments on the liverpool plains also within the seat of new england which will wreak havoc on farmland the liverpool plains have some of the best soil in the world outside ukraine and are also part of the largest subartesian groundwater resource in the murraydarling system in addition they are adjacent to the great artesian basin which is the lifeblood of 24 per cent of australias landmass critical issues for the local mp one would think but silence from the man in the hat it is worth noting that the windmills used to pump water from underground have been replaced by solar pumps the windmills were never considered a blight on the horizon but a sign of progress and prosperity for the driest continent on earth joyces distaste for renewable energy and his silence towards coal seam gas highlights his real agenda driven by gina rinehart and others it puts the farming community in a very difficult position one that farm leaders will need to think about very seriously im writing this at the same time environment minister murray watt tries to walk both sides of the street in revamping the nations dysfunctional environment laws what has not been well noticed is a new provision to walk back the water trigger julia gillard inserted into environment law in the dying days of her prime ministership watt is seeking to have it revert to the states whose record on water is mixed to be generous last week the premier of new south wales chris minns popped up threatening the compulsory acquisition of farmland to get a gas pipeline through to the santosbacked narrabri gas project against the determined and persistent opposition of local landholders the premier would well know the santos proposal which currently has signoff on extracting gas above the great artesian basin needs to have subtle guarantees from government that if it begins work at narrabri it will have access to the liverpool plains in future to make the project economical the pipeline is the head of the snake from barnaby joyce radio silence i wonder why in short then does the farming community submit to the populist view of the world being espoused by one nation and many in the nationals and that of the great climate scientist tony abbott that climate change is absolute crap or do they embrace the opportunities and challenges of the next century and recognise they will experience profound benefits if australia leads the way on renewable energy and sustainable farming systems here are the raw politics of this debate first the coalition is out of government for at least two terms longer if the nationals continue their farce on net zero joyce and his cronies will have next to no chance of achieving any substantive outcomes other than pandering to lazy media in the hope of attracting attention second china will become the dominant player in the world and will take the lead on addressing climate change thus enhancing its economic strength as the united states declines the popular narrative used by climate deniers that there is no point acting if china doesnt will fade very quickly and once again china will be ahead of the rest third europe and other affluent parts of the world will demand food that is produced in countries wishing to reduce global emissions tariffs and other charges are already being contemplated by many countries like it or not they are becoming a significant part of international trade if farmers fall for the siren song of joyce rinehart and one nation they run the risk of being seen as climate deniers and the political impacts of this stance populist as it may be would be massively damaging to country people this would be their brexit the pain of which will be felt long after the good idea at the time caravan disappears over the dusty horizon we already have witnessed domestic political upheaval from joyces anticlimate rhetoric which has damaged the coalition and propelled the teals and other independents into parliament polling suggests independents could win up to six more seats at the next election city dwellers have always had a somewhat romantic view of rural and remote australia tinged with great regard and respect for those producing good food at a good price in a relatively harsh environment and for others who live and work in those communities most australians do not live far from the coast that situation is not changing so the likelihood of any country ginger group taking over our parliaments is remote to say the least we are not trumps america regard and affection for our inland inhabitants is demonstrated by governments of all persuasions encouraged by our metropolitan communities assisting the farm sector and country people generally in times of flood fire drought and cyclones i have always read it as a way of saying thanks for what you do for us and the economy in the good times yet as climate change has turbocharged the weather systems many people in australia are more and more concerned about the future of generations to come this will be reflected in the way they vote and the policies that will apply to regional australia over time if farmers and regional people follow the joyce and abbott line of doing nothing about climate change the victims of extreme climate events will be themselves and they may no longer be able to rely on citybased governments being prepared to wear the cost agriculture would risk losing the social licence it has always enjoyed it was interesting to watch some of the recent tamworth defectors from the nationals to one nation explaining their motivation by decrying renewables and climate change as major reasons these are the same people who would be in my office when i was in politics asking for financial assistance any time an adverse weather event occurred do they really expect that to keep happening if they deny the science and australias part in the remedies on offer cheaper cleaner more reliable energy the coastal majority may well be impacted by climate change but not to the same extent as the agricultural sector abatements in the cities might involve more barricades on the coastline where storm surges occur larger airconditioning units and maybe ironically an extra solar panel or two or a battery in the garage for farmers climate change takes down the entire business model australia has led the world on dryland farming systems and has been part of the development of renewable energy technology we should be proud of those achievements and build on them we should not listen to shortterm selfserving narcissists the nationals are in retreat they lost the seat of calare at the last election failed to pick up bendigo despite a milliondollar campaign and helped the coalition lose the seat of bullwinkel by running against the liberals there dividing communities against each other and against their best interests can only encourage more country people to look elsewhere for genuine representation the question is only whether that happens before the metropolitan majority declare themselves unprepared to help communities that wont help themselves",
    "need some help optimizing for an academic research use case hi all so first time poster somewhat recently arrived lurker have been building my own computers forever including my current workstation but am getting to the point now where a constellation of changes in my workloads and having more people working under me has made me finally willing to invest in a more performant and scalable compute system this is where im hoping the sub can come to my rescue the problem im part of a lab at an r1 university that works with a combination of very highresolution spatial and climate data think daily 1km or even sub1km resolution for that is then processed for use in downstream causal inference and dataset generation both steps being done internally by our lab though often by different groups of people our lab also routinely generates our own data using the downstream products using modern but light ml architectures think rf gradient boosted decision trees etc we have access to highperformance computing through the university but it is not feasible for some lab members to use hpc clusters due to lack of permissions or lack of expertise and pushing my ras onto the hpc tends to massively increase turnaround time because of how much it slows the ability to iterate scripts quickly and writing code that produces very detailed and informative console output that can be used for effective debugging is not a skill most of my ras have prototyping on local machines is typically prohibitively costlycomplex and it is often the case that problems wont crop up on the relatively small portion of data they pull in while working locally when pushing stuff to the hpc we also are always having to contend with culling what data is being housed in the university data center because of pretty low limits there the data security and admin needs of such a universitywide hpc are also very cumbersome for us since we work with data that is publicly available and not subject to any securityprivacy risk tldr building our own compute resource that allows at least a couple lab members at a time to work directly from the gui in a live ide session especially for debugging as a script is being run at scale for the first time makes a lot of sense compute and storage needs we have basically two kinds of workflows both entirely cpubound or memorybound no one in the lab has any facility with writing code that can utilize modern gpus and that code would not be very reproducible by the broader community so assume very little can be pushed onto the gpu except what is possible passively under the hood in linux via stuff like using nvidia nvblas the first is very memory intensive but not incredibly coreintensive typical workflows here would be something like 510gbworker these workflows require ondemand access to one or more hires data products ranging between 50500gb per product typical workflows parallelize over subsets of these products with a subset of the product loaded in by each worker because of this data io is a huge bottleneck and the use of nvme drives here is basically mandatory these workflows are typically handled by me but thats because i built a workstation specially designed to do this the second is very coreintensive but not especially memory intensive think big dataframes with lots of matrix operations closer to 1gbworker the main bottleneck here is cores although of course if you pushed the cores up enough youd have to contend with memory bottlenecks eventually but at that point our runtimes would be plenty fast enough the workflows are typically sequential the ramintensive processing happens first then the coreintensive downstream tasks after both workflows require ondisk access to anywhere from 2tb to 10tb at a time needless to say all of this very quickly outstrips what can be done on the local machines that people come to the lab with typically overpriced mac laptops and the like the one thing we have going in our favor is that we have a ton of cloud storage on our enterprise account 75tb of which about 30tb is currently being used the proposed solution so this is where you guys come in hoping for some feedback here im basically building this off my own dime due to the budget cuts so im trying to work with what i already have which is essentially 2 rigs in addition to providing a much easier development environment for people in the lab it also arbitrages off the one thing we have working for us free electricity from the uni building so while component costs are a real constraint the power footprint can be anything reasonable trx40 aorus master threadripper 3960x w 420mm aio cooler for sustained allcore loads 256gb 3200mhz corsair vengeance lpx unfortunately this is max on tr40 boards 3090 fe essentially completely useless except for some light ml applications 2tb boot drive 2x 4tb gen4 nvme main drives run in raid0 in a m2 hyperx card with pcie bifurcation no scratch drive at the moment looking to add one as we speak 1200w psu the second rig which im building out right now and paying through the nose to max out the ram on is supermicro smc x11dpht 2x xeon gold 6240 128gb ddr4 2666mhz 16x8gb 1tb nvme ssd boot drive no scratch or storage drives yet my plan is to split our pipelines into two pieces the initial processing pipeline which will be handled by the threadripper machine this would eventually be replaced by an epyc machine with 512gb of ddr4 once prices come down and the downstream analysisdataset generation pipeline which will be handled by dual xeon rig to avoid having to build out a bunch of storage on each machine my plan was to just add a scratch drive to the second rig and then build out a storage rack that would essentially be a local mirror of our cloud account chatgpt is telling me to house the nas on the dual xeon rig to cut down costs seems reasonable it has to be fast enough to pull something like 13tb onto the scratch drive in a reasonable amount of time lets say a couple hours and write the output back without bottlenecking things too badly but because all our data will be mirrored in the cloud im not too worried about building tons of redundancy here was thinking raidz2 or raid10like so my first question is does this make sense or is it really dumb for some reason i dont fully understand my second question is supposing this isnt dumb what is the optimal way to access both machines our lab has members in multiple countries and on multiple continents so an ideal solution would be one that doesnt require a ton of setup on the user side andor that isnt too complexfragile but also lets them have lowlatency so that it isnt too painful to do build out scripts in a remote environment my third question is assuming this setup is reasonable what is the best storage solution ive been doing lots of research but this is by far the area where i know the least and rather than say some buzzword shit i dont really understand hba synology blah blah blah id rather just hear what you all think cost is a pretty serious constraint here as all of the storage hardware will need to be purchased but everything will be bought used in an attempt to hit the desired throughput to the compute rigs without breaking the bank if you got to the end thanks for reading all this and apologies if any of this comes off as stupidly misguided i am basically a researcher and very light pc enthusiast who is trying to get us the functionality we need so im definitely not the hero we need but im the one we got hoping you guys have some good ideas thanks in advance",

    "whats the purpose of barnaby joyce back the saturday paper logo november 8 14 2025 no 575 comment tony windsor what is the purpose of barnaby joyce give this article share barnaby joyce has always talked a story about himself bigger than the brim on his hopalong cassidy hat he is a oneman plot line but his achievements for the people he professes to represent are slim to infinitesimal even joyces former campaign manager mayor of tamworth russell webb told local television barnaby cant get anything done somehow he is being rewarded for all this his threats to leave the nationals have put him in the headlines he so adores and helped end his partys commitment to net zero in the process hes possibly destroyed the coalition rarely has a man of such little substance had so much consequence if joyce makes good on his promise and leaves politics at the next election what would it mean for the people of new england and for australian politics more broadly in my view it is good news for new england there is no doubt the joyce brand has resonated with many particularly his antiparty party stance and there has been plenty of colour and movement to distract people on the ground however very little has been happening in the seat since he was elected in 2013 he has always been more interested in politics than people and new england was just a runway to ambition next to no infrastructure has been built in the electorate in the past decade other than the illthoughtout relocation of the australian pesticides and veterinary medicines authority to armidale the man who promised to build 100 dams has built net zero in fact the only real infrastructure changes and the jobs that go with them have been renewable energy projects dismissed and denigrated by joyce as eyesores and factories with little social licence these renewable projects have become a major part of the rationale joyce uses to explain his estrangement from the nationals he claims he must act to stop this scourge moving across the landscape to protect farmland of course the sentiment is wrongheaded but its also hypocritical thats joyces two modes in one position his criticism of renewable projects stands in stark contrast to his inaction on santoss coal seam gas developments on the liverpool plains also within the seat of new england which will wreak havoc on farmland the liverpool plains have some of the best soil in the world outside ukraine and are also part of the largest subartesian groundwater resource in the murraydarling system in addition they are adjacent to the great artesian basin which is the lifeblood of 24 per cent of australias landmass critical issues for the local mp one would think but silence from the man in the hat if farmers fall for the siren song of joyce rinehart and one nation they run the risk of being seen as climate deniers and the political impacts of this stance populist as it may be would be massively damaging to country people this would be their brexit it is worth noting that the windmills used to pump water from underground have been replaced by solar pumps the windmills were never considered a blight on the horizon but a sign of progress and prosperity for the driest continent on earth joyces distaste for renewable energy and his silence towards coal seam gas highlights his real agenda driven by gina rinehart and others it puts the farming community in a very difficult position one that farm leaders will need to think about very seriously im writing this at the same time environment minister murray watt tries to walk both sides of the street in revamping the nations dysfunctional environment laws what has not been well noticed is a new provision to walk back the water trigger julia gillard inserted into environment law in the dying days of her prime ministership watt is seeking to have it revert to the states whose record on water is mixed to be generous last week the premier of new south wales chris minns popped up threatening the compulsory acquisition of farmland to get a gas pipeline through to the santosbacked narrabri gas project against the determined and persistent opposition of local landholders the premier would well know the santos proposal which currently has signoff on extracting gas above the great artesian basin needs to have subtle guarantees from government that if it begins work at narrabri it will have access to the liverpool plains in future to make the project economical the pipeline is the head of the snake from barnaby joyce radio silence i wonder why in short then does the farming community submit to the populist view of the world being espoused by one nation and many in the nationals and that of the great climate scientist tony abbott that climate change is absolute crap or do they embrace the opportunities and challenges of the next century and recognise they will experience profound benefits if australia leads the way on renewable energy and sustainable farming systems related reading barnaby joyce poses for a photograph prior to the 2005 queensland national party state conference news exclusive dutton told joyce we just want you out jason koutsoukis here are the raw politics of this debate first the coalition is out of government for at least two terms longer if the nationals continue their farce on net zero joyce and his cronies will have next to no chance of achieving any substantive outcomes other than pandering to lazy media in the hope of attracting attention second china will become the dominant player in the world and will take the lead on addressing climate change thus enhancing its economic strength as the united states declines the popular narrative used by climate deniers that there is no point acting if china doesnt will fade very quickly and once again china will be ahead of the rest third europe and other affluent parts of the world will demand food that is produced in countries wishing to reduce global emissions tariffs and other charges are already being contemplated by many countries like it or not they are becoming a significant part of international trade if farmers fall for the siren song of joyce rinehart and one nation they run the risk of being seen as climate deniers and the political impacts of this stance populist as it may be would be massively damaging to country people this would be their brexit the pain of which will be felt long after the good idea at the time caravan disappears over the dusty horizon we already have witnessed domestic political upheaval from joyces anticlimate rhetoric which has damaged the coalition and propelled the teals and other independents into parliament polling suggests independents could win up to six more seats at the next election city dwellers have always had a somewhat romantic view of rural and remote australia tinged with great regard and respect for those producing good food at a good price in a relatively harsh environment and for others who live and work in those communities most australians do not live far from the coast that situation is not changing so the likelihood of any country ginger group taking over our parliaments is remote to say the least we are not trumps america regard and affection for our inland inhabitants is demonstrated by governments of all persuasions encouraged by our metropolitan communities assisting the farm sector and country people generally in times of flood fire drought and cyclones i have always read it as a way of saying thanks for what you do for us and the economy in the good times yet as climate change has turbocharged the weather systems many people in australia are more and more concerned about the future of generations to come this will be reflected in the way they vote and the policies that will apply to regional australia over time if farmers and regional people follow the joyce and abbott line of doing nothing about climate change the victims of extreme climate events will be themselves and they may no longer be able to rely on citybased governments being prepared to wear the cost agriculture would risk losing the social licence it has always enjoyed it was interesting to watch some of the recent tamworth defectors from the nationals to one nation explaining their motivation by decrying renewables and climate change as major reasons these are the same people who would be in my office when i was in politics asking for financial assistance any time an adverse weather event occurred do they really expect that to keep happening if they deny the science and australias part in the remedies on offer cheaper cleaner more reliable energy the coastal majority may well be impacted by climate change but not to the same extent as the agricultural sector abatements in the cities might involve more barricades on the coastline where storm surges occur larger airconditioning units and maybe ironically an extra solar panel or two or a battery in the garage for farmers climate change takes down the entire business model australia has led the world on dryland farming systems and has been part of the development of renewable energy technology we should be proud of those achievements and build on them we should not listen to shortterm selfserving narcissists the nationals are in retreat they lost the seat of calare at the last election failed to pick up bendigo despite a milliondollar campaign and helped the coalition lose the seat of bullwinkel by running against the liberals there dividing communities against each other and against their best interests can only encourage more country people to look elsewhere for genuine representation the question is only whether that happens before the metropolitan majority declare themselves unprepared to help communities that wont help themselves this article was first published in the print edition of the saturday paper on november 8 2025 as what is the purpose of barnaby joyce",
    "let them drown the violence of othering in a warming world we have dangerously warmed our world already and our governments still refuse to take the actions necessary to halt the trend there was a time when many had the right to claim ignorance but for the past three decades since the intergovernmental panel on climate change was created and climate negotiations began this refusal to lower emissions has been accompanied with full awareness of the dangers and this kind of recklessness would have been functionally impossible without institutional racism even if only latent it would have been impossible without orientalism without all the potent tools on offer that allow the powerful to discount the lives of the less powerful these toolsof ranking the relative value of humansare what allow the writing off of entire nations and ancient cultures and they are what allowed for the digging up of all that carbon to begin with naomi klein",

years our reputation was built by carefully combining precision construction and craftsmanship to help our clients realize their vision for refined homes built to exacting standards on the west coast over the years weve seen a transition theres still plenty of demand for luxury home construction but with an emphasis on greener builds people want sustainable home builders to create spaces that will have a positive impact on their familiesand the people in their communities futrhaus was completed at 1156 east 13th avenue in vancouvers mount pleasant neighbourhood in 2019 designed by b squared architecture inc our team at billingsley home construction was brought in to build the homes the threeunit multiplex residence sits on a previous singlefamily lot to meet muchneeded demand for threebedroom family housing in vancouver additionally the multiplex housing had to be built to passive house energy standards aligning with the city of vancouvers goal for sustainability up to 90 energy savings through superior construction futrhaus went on to become one of vancouvers first residential developments to combine a singlehome to multiunit housing conversion with passive house green building technology however it was also built to luxury standards including hardwood flooring high ceilings elegant gourmet kitchens featuring large islands topoftheline appliances and beautiful indoortooutdoor transitions leading to large balconies and patios its a project that not only emphasizes living sustainably but living well with all the amenities needed for a comfortable and luxurious family home what set this project apart was adherence to the highperformance passive house standard we were able to achieve through construction choices like thickened walls tripleglazed windows solar orientation and a heatrecovery ventilator hrv system we tempered these choices with systems for air filtration to remove dust and pollen so while the house is tightly sealed it still feels fresh clean and airynot stuffy which has been a criticism for passive homes without the right planning together these features not only resulted in a comfortable energyefficient homethey resulted in energy savings of up to 90 compared to conventional construction sustainable home builders in vancouver today more people are willing to pay a premium for ecofriendly properties to realize

    "intersection of idealism and pragmatism only at the intersection of idealism and pragmatism can we find fair and effective solution to societys problems in the previous post we defined what is the normative and positive branch of liberal sciences we discussed that the normative branch deals with how things should work in an ethical framework while the positive branch deals with the description of a subject based on observations empiricism and a causeandeffect behavioral relationship positive branch is divorced from how things should work and is objective and pragmatic in nature normative approach is closely related to idealism whereas positive approach is related to pragmatism we also referred to the fact that unrealistic expectations might arise from relying too much on normative idealistic thinking overidealistic thinking either yields impractical solutions or no solution at all let us explore this a little further human beings and communities have imperfect behavior while promoting idealism is a moral duty of a society pragmatism is what helps us in understanding and effectively solving societal problems by taking into account realworld complexities and constraints it is very common to ignore and downplay the importance of positive liberal sciences and pragmatism often people think that the only way of solving the problems of a community or humanity is to work on making people behave more ideally while this is a noble goal this type of thinking will lead to massive disappointment as attaining perfect human behavior in a society is an unachievable goal idealistic people who have moralistic notions about how people should behave without understanding how people really do behave do more harm than good the principles ray dalio achieving progress and uplifting a community cannot be accomplished by merely theorizing abstract moral solutions instead it requires firm grounding in realities of the world this in turn needs a clear understanding of 1 human imperfections and 2 resource constraints for coming up with pragmatic solutions one needs strong analytical skills and critical thinking which is the primary purpose of studying positive liberal sciences one can assess the complexity of realworld by examining few concepts within liberal sciences example tragedy of commons in economics democratic elitism in democracy realism in international politics of this we will only discuss the tragedy of commons here the other two concepts will be deferred to future posts tragedy of commons is an economic concept that explains how shared resources can get depleted by overconsumption when individuals act in their own selfinterest rather than considering the common good examples can be found in panic buying during covid19 where people started stocking their supplies without thinking of other peoples needs as a result a large number of people were left without supplies causing shortages and price spikes another example is climate change climate change requires all countries with different circumstances to come on a common page and cut down carbon emissions so far it is not working the examples above present real life challenges with different degrees of complexity while thinking about the solution one can take the following approaches approach1 idealism reform people to not be selfish and develop empathy for the society by invoking the bonds of religion nationalism humanity approach2 pragmatism develop some form of rationing to prevent depletion of supplies during a panic buying scenario in addition enact laws making hoarding illegal for the case of climate change something like a paris accord can be worked out where the wealthier nation should fund the renewable sources of energy in developing nations the key question is which approach should be adopted the normative approach alone cannot solve the problem as we can never get a global perfect human behavior and it is an empty hypothetical solution to rely purely on altruism however disregarding normative approach would be shortsighted normative thinking has shaped humanity and maintained order in society and nations without which human beings would have destroyed each other even a pragmatic approach needs to be guided by an underlying normative view which also sets its starting point for instance if the normative framework suggests that climate change is a hoax then it would not even qualify as a tragedy of commons problem the pragmatic approach holds great value in solving issues defined by a normative view though it doesnt define an end goal pragmatic approach is crucial for understanding human behavior through data analysis historical case studies and other scientific principles with this analysis it comes up with creative and optimal solutions to tackle a problem in both short and longterm only at the intersection of idealism and pragmatism exists the solution to complex problems of the real world idealism provides high level guidance on how things ought to be done in an ethical society but it doesnt give precise solutions precise solutions is the realm of pragmatic study of liberal science ie positive liberal sciences as previously mentioned liberal sciencesderived solutions are rarely perfect due to resource constraints and inherent human imperfections consider the example of income inequality which has been a longstanding issue faced by all the societies while the normative approach might suggest altruistic wealth redistribution as was tried in communist countries it remains a failed impractical approach pragmatic strategies like wealth tax and progressive income tax developed through data analysis and causeandeffect relationships may provide more tangible means to address the issue however in todays interconnected world finding the right balance is crucial as overtaxation could lead to capital flight while maintaining the status quo may further exacerbate income disparities these are the complex real world problems for which liberal science attempts to provide optimal solution based on normative prescriptions and pragmatic approach thanks for reading the post dont forget to check

    "the harsh reality of corporate esg more greenwashing than green action namaste everyone you know sometimes i sit with my evening chai and think about how companies talk about being responsible with esg environmental social and governance but then i read things like a 2023 report from changing markets foundation reported by the guardian which found a staggering 96 of green claims by fashion brands were misleading it makes you wonder doesnt it is this all real impact or just a masterclass in public relations globally esg assets under management aum were projected to hit a staggering 339 trillion by the end of 2022 with forecasts pointing to 53 trillion by 2025 according to bloomberg intelligence thats a massive amount of money tied to being responsible yet theres a clear trust deficit among investors a 2023 bloomberg survey found that 55 of global investors believe esg data is not consistently reliable and 53 find it not consistently comparable this skepticism isnt without reason a 2020 european commission study found 42 of environmental claims on company websites were exaggerated or deceptive even more concerning only 7 of 25 major global companies were on track to meet their publicly stated netzero targets as of 2022 according to the newclimate institute tariq fancy former cio of sustainable investing at blackrock openly stated in 2021 that many companies use esg as a branding exercise without making fundamental changes its a lot of talk not always enough action and this is why weve seen investigations and fines for misrepresentation like germanys dws reported by reuters in 2023 here in india our market regulator sebi securities and exchange board of india has mandated business responsibility and sustainability reporting brsr for top listed companies from fy 202223 which is a good step towards structure however pwc india noted in 2023 that gathering quality data especially for the social and governance aspects remains a big challenge this problem extends globally different esg rating agencies often disagree on what makes a company good showing a low correlation of around 053 on average unlike credit ratings which are much higher as per an mit sloan study from 2019 sach yeh hai jab maapne ka tareeka hi alag ho toh kaise bharosa karein now its important to remember that its not all superficial esg frameworks do provide a necessary push for corporate accountability investor demand for sustainable options is genuine and growing and some studies like those by msci suggest strong esg practices can lead to better longterm financial performance regulations are also slowly evolving to curb greenwashing with the eus sustainable finance disclosure regulation sfdr currently under review to improve clarity some leaders like jamie dimon from jpmorgan chase believe companies should stick to their core business while others like paul polman former ceo of unilever emphasize that true sustainability must be embedded deeply into strategy not just presented as window dressing so while the intention behind esg is often good the execution and transparency still have a long way to go for many corporations for us it means looking beyond the glossy reports and asking tougher questions about actual verifiable impact what are your thoughts on this have you seen companies genuinely commit to impactful esg efforts or do you feel its mostly a show for public relations share your experiences and insights below",

    "tigray has gained more international attention we need to use this to try and lobby the un to implement the ichree or something better i dont know if any of you are having similar experiences but im finding that i have to explain less and less about the genocide in tigray when i tell people im tigrayan more people are aware of our situation and i dont need to explain i also see more nontigrayans on social media advocating for tigray im thinking we need to use this to try to get the un to implement a better version of the ichree one that does not need to be renewed annually it will be hard to pull off but the worst thing we can do is not try although the un doesnt do much for people it will make it harder for abiy to fund proxy militias like tpf and create more consequences for abiy and isaias if they go to war here are all the reasons it could work global awareness has grown in my own experience im finding that more and more people already know the basics of tigray genocide instead of explaining the conflict from scratch im now answering questions about the perpetrators and ethiopias political history this growing awareness means we have a real chance to get people to lobby their mps and pressure key governments to support ichrees renewal the world is not under covid fatigue anymore and seems to have shifted to hyperawareness during the height of the war on tigray people were emotionally numb from constant crises the pandemic global instability and death everywhere that climate made it hard for anyone to engage with another humanitarian catastrophe now were in a different moment people are paying attention to world injustices again the same demographics that are speaking out about palestine sudan and congo can support accountability for tigray but we need to be strategic and reach them with clarity and conviction ethiopians will not be as strong an obstacle this time during the war every petition protest or advocacy effort was drowned out by ethiopian state propaganda and coordinated diaspora disinformation campaigns but things have changed because they didnt gain anything from the war on tigray and sustained more losses than they predicted many ethiopians now realize how manipulated they were by pp narratives even if they dont say it publicly the propaganda machine has lost credibility and some will understand that reinstating ichree isnt antiethiopia its proaccountability the tigrayan diaspora is already organized during the war we had to build our networks from scratch omna tigray global society of tigray scholars regional community groups and more now those structures exist if we can coordinate them internationally and synchronize messaging we can be louder than weve ever been potential alliances could broaden our impact especially with opposition eritreans eritrean advocacy groups opposing the hgdf such as one day seyoum are among the most organized in terms of east african diasporas giving them a unique capacity to push for accountability they have a strong incentive to support international mechanisms that hold their government in check and curb military overreach this is more of a long shot but collaborating with oromo and amhara groups who are also being targeted by the federal government could amplify this impact a key collective motivation for all these groups is preventing ethiopia and eritrea from going to war again making crossethnic and regional solidarity a powerful force for accountability on the international stage but we should plan for the event that they choose to be ignorant our 2020 efforts proved that we dont need any of their allyship but it would be a stronger fight if we could work together the odds are against us but its not impossible and it would take lots of effort and hard work but for the future of tigray its worth it all edit the united nations will hold its 61st regular session of the human rights council hrc61 in geneva from late february to early april 2026 which is the key meeting where countries can propose and vote on renewing or reestablishing ichree so advocacy and lobbying efforts need to build momentum well before this session",

    "blocking the sun isnt going to work technooptimists want to block the sun to save us from climate change they point to stratospheric aerosol injection as a solution that occurs naturally during volcanic eruptions the typically suggested example is the 1991 eruption of mount pinatubo it was originally thought to reduce temperatures by 05 degree celsius globally by blocking sunlight these estimates turn out to be wrong however as natural variability was not sufficiently corrected for newer studies find much lower estimates this study finds a peak of 028 degree celsius this study finds a peak of just 01 to 015 degree celsius temperature reduction in the area between the arctic and the antarctic so why does this matter well we know what the effects of the pinatubo eruption were on our world the chlorine from the eruption increased the hole in the ozone layer and the creation of cloud condensation nuclei in the stratosphere allowed massive rainfall that led to the most destructive floods ever recorded in the united states its also held responsible for a massive flood in eastern china effects on crop yields by blocking sunlight seem to have been quite significant however the estimate here suggests a 9 reduction in maize yield and a 5 for other staple crops as a consequence of the eruption look at it this way if youre buying yourself a 05 degree decrease in global temperatures in exchange for a 5 reduction in crop yields that may seem a decent deal but if the real reduction youre buying is 01 degree celsius the deal ceases to make sense in summary the consequences of geoengineering are likely to be far more damaging than originally assumed because the best example weve seen in nature of what were hoping to do was far less impactful than we originally thought of course as with carbon pollution the damage from geoengineering scales nonlinearly the next 2 of sunlight you block will have more severe unintended consequences than the first 2 just as the second degree of warming will cause more damage than the first degree did in summary blocking the sun is not going to buy us more than a few years at a high cost",

    "in progress40kfantasy with and without hey all looking for beta readers to see how this novel lands with them it is unfinished but i plan it to be around 65000 to 80000 words just about it is a novel about a decaying republic that slides into autocracy due to the changing political climate but that is not what the story is entirely about first and foremost it is an epistolary novel that seeks to democratize interiority it is similar in form to john williams augustus and faulkners as i lay dying but of course far from the quality of such great works the content itself is a loose plot that is based on the daily lives of the characters you will meet a man who rises from a poor background and becomes a highly respected political leader a woman who prides herself on her education yet is quietly rebelling against the expectations of her class and country a fallen scion of a noble house who holds much piety in the old ways of doing things and somehow in a godless world his prayers are somewhat answered there is a choral arrangement of unknown fragments from common soldiers to a wise professor who reflects on love and life to his younger brother whose name is lost to history this is all to attempt to utilize modernist techniques to enter in dialogue with postmodernist characteristics and also paradoxically an attempt to combine low and high forms of art genre conventions with a literary sensibility finally the most pertinent way to read it is this it is a love letter to humanity to the complexities of societies to questions and to people i am looking first and foremost for whether it is an enjoyable read whether the prose induces even a minuscule level of feeling in the reader and whether the characters are sympathetic interesting and vivid any critiques should be whether the lack of plot is too dormant or to complicated to really grip ones teeth into further whether there is little to no momentum i will also be interested in ones like or dislike of the novels pace whether the structure is well made and whether dialogue lands or needs to be a bit more modern ie snappy and less monologic also to clarify the world is one that is based on the 19th century so it is very much also a love letter to the second generation of romantics as well as the aesthetics of that time period it is also an exploration of enlightenment principles i am open to a swap and would love to read some of your works thank you",
