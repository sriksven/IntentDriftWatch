    "finalizing my x5 build input needed on suspension wheels and drivetrain tradeoffs after crossshopping a lot of suvs ive finally settled on the x5 i recently took a long road trip a few thousand miles in total in sixts base xdrive40i configuration and that pretty much sealed the deal i loved the overall driving feel its just on another level compared to everything else ive driven that said im trying to sort out a few configuration decisions before committing suspension options the base suspension feels good overall but may be a bit firm for my taste im used to softer rides coming from an mdx i test drove one with 2axle air suspension and was really impressed compared to the base setup especially going over speed bumps but the dealers test route was short i never got above 50 mph or on the freeway so im not totally sure how wellinformed my current perspective isbut it felt like a must have in the moment for sure i do worry about maintenance on the air suspension i plan on keeping this vehicle longterm i cant find much clear info on how the adaptive m sport suspension compares to the base and air setups in realworld feel i suspect the m sport setup is generally firmer but im curious if there are scenarios like in comfort mode where it might actually feel softer or more compliant than the base suspension if thats the case it could be worth considering to avoid chasing after the much rarer air suspension aesthetically i actually prefer the front end of the base design but i do like the bodycolor fenders on the m sportso im flexible on going with either the base or m sport if the adaptive suspension adds comfort over the standard setup my biggest limitation with dealer inventory will probably be finding one equipped with the 2axle air suspension wheels most dealer stock near me has 22s and to be honest they look a bit disproportionate in my opinion id rather stick with 20s or maybe 21s since ive never had staggered wheels or runflats my concern isnt necessarily the cost its practicality for my use case i just dont see the point of throwing money at something that doesnt matter that much to me and since ive never dealt with staggered wheels im assuming you go through tires more often than with a square setup are the 20s the smarter longterm choice if im not chasing the sportier feel that comes with staggered wheels or is the expense and tire wear difference between 20s and 21s22s not actually that significant in realworld ownership drivetrain ive seen a lot of talk about differential issues im on the gulf coast no snow so sdrive would be fine for my use case but resale on xdrive definitely seems far stronger are those differential problems actually common enough to avoid it and eat a little bit on residuals or is it mostly preventable with proactive fluid changes im debating whether to order one or buy from dealer inventory theres a cash incentive i have that only applies to instock units and id rather keep the leverage of buying something already on the lotbut i know that comes with compromising on the build my two musthaves are the climate package and driver assistance package beyond that im figuring out which potential tradeoffs would make the most sense for me i also have a tradein and want to keep everything local due to sales tax credits etc so im not really looking to use a broker any insight from people whove owned or driven different setups would be really appreciated just trying to make an informed decision before i chase something that may not be all that worthwhile in the end",
    "welcome to hell my single air purifier has been failing to keep up",
    "i lost my ability to daydream for four years and never got treated because my results were only just outside of normal ill condense the dosage info and put a tldr at the bottom i dont know who to be upset with im angry with the medical system in general im angry about medical misogyny and how it limited my knowledge of my own health and how it has caused me to minimize my own issues in 2018 got my first blood test since i was a kid they did not check my iron but my tsh was 12 they didnt treat it because i was young and it eventually went down to 9 and it fluctuated between 6 and 9 for years my iron was tested in 2022 and i was deficient ferritin 15 but at the time it was considered to be within normal range im 22 when i was a teenager daydreaming was my life i had plenty of hobbies but they all revolved around this one world and this one set of characters i adored them when i listened to music i thought about them when i drew i drew them when i wrote i wrote about them i was so happy because my daydreams were so rich and colourful and i could always fall back on them in 2020 my mom died of cancer a lot changed in general so i didnt notice when i changed my daydreams became sparse disjointed and limited i started having to actively think about them having a single daydream became so draining and eventually i could do little more than write a few sentences before becoming bored and uninterested i was also profoundly depressed and anxious all i could think about was climate change pollution and how i was going to be alone forever i was living in hell i thought it was my fault i thought maybe if i think about things differently or recreate the tropes i used to love or listen to the right music ill have the magic back someday i tried so hard i was let down again and again and again i can feel the ghost of where affection and excitement should be but i cant actually feel the emotion its too tiring too forced im not sure but its not fully there i only realized i was depressed late last year i didnt want to accept it before because i didnt want to take ssris and well i used to be the happiest person i knew i never could have imagined calling myself depressed i also hated the idea of any and all medication i didnt believe in supplements all of this was spurred on by my depression and cynicism i started iron in january a week in i was euphorically happy i went out into the cold and literally danced and ran up and down the block i made snow angels i cried i stood outside and watched the sky until the sun set that ended after a week but the anxiety and depression slowly went away life slowly got better ferritin was 83 in october yay still my daydreams did not come back i eventually gave up on the idea that daydreaming would ever be easy again and for the record i think saying ferritin of anywhere under 80 is within range is crazy 30 is egregious my tsh tested at 11 last month which made sense i was sleeping a lot and tired a lot i finally asked the doctor to put me on levo mostly so i could function better in my everyday life i didnt expect things to change so drastically a week into levo i felt just like how i used to i did nothing but daydream for a week life was full of colour music made me feel things again i could not believe how amazing i felt and i just knew this is different this isnt just my imagination this is something real and powerful i dont even have to try i sit down and start writing and the scene flows until it ends my story and my characters are vivid in my mind its palpable i can almost hear them almost feel them almost see them its so vivid its perfect i havent had that in years that only lasted a week i feel mostly the same as before though a little better i think definitely less tired mostly my appetite is different i have less munchies but im hungrier i no longer need to portion tiny amounts of food but still the daydreams are maybe slightly improved but still not quite there i think and hope levo will bring back my daydreams once my dosage is right i can deal with the depression i can deal with the anxiety i can deal with the weakness and the loneliness im having trouble with the loss of my daydreams so much time i could have spent in my world gone four years i guess i just wish id been told to take supplements anyway take levothyroxine anyway you dont know how your conditions will affect you if theyve been around for so long also i felt okay even with hypo in my teen years one thing that no one really talks about is how your symptoms can change maybe teen you was asymptomatic but adult you could very well develop symptoms with the same or lower tsh levels that you had as a teen its always better to keep your levels within range i think i also wish someone had told me that a tsh anywhere outside of the optimal range can cause you to be an entirely different person i hate that i was under the impression that tsh doesnt become an issue until it hits 10 or higher i was exhausted my appetite was fucked i think my body couldnt metabolize vitamins or minerals or caffeine but the changes were slow and ive had low tsh since i was a teenager of course i didnt suspect it of course i didnt notice something had changed i just wish someone had encouraged me to get treated for it im still not fully there yet im getting there but ill never get those years back tldr i think i lost four years of my life to iron deficiency and hypo because my levels were technically within range or only just outside of it tsh 11 levo synthroid 50 mcg ferritin 15 january 83

    "you are a social media expert come up with a good title for a reddit post to help push my enviromental propaganda make it impossible for the average redditor to not rage click were being fed a steady diet of articles about how your chatgpt queries are destroying the planet while industrial agriculture which dwarfs ais impact by an order of magnitude gets treated like background noise this isnt an accident its a textbook example of what researchers call climate delay discourse industrial livestock is responsible for 1120 of all global greenhouse gas emissions the global food system overall accounts for about a third of humancaused emissions half the worlds habitable land goes to agriculture and 7580 of that agricultural land is dedicated to livestock either as pasture or growing animal feed animal products contribute more than onequarter of humanitys entire water footprint and its not just beef dairy production generates about 32 of global greenhouse gas emissions on its own a kilogram of cheese produces about 135 kg of co2 equivalent higher than chicken or pork a liter of milk generates about 32 kg of co2 equivalent and requires about 628 liters of water to produce the global dairy sector uses roughly 10 of all agricultural land and 20 of agricultural emissions the entire data center ecosystem ai cryptocurrency everything is projected to hit around 4 of global electricity demand by 2026 training a large ai model produces emissions equivalent to about 300 roundtrip flights both matter but you wouldnt know it from the discourse ai gets endless handwringing think pieces agriculture gets what exactly heres what makes me absolutely crazy people will share articles about how your ai queries are destroying the planet then go eat a burger without a second thought you cant get most people to even acknowledge that beef has a significant environmental impact mention it and youre immediately dismissed as preachy extreme pushing an agenda the defensiveness is instant and total but suggest that maybe we should be cautious about ai use suddenly everyones a concerned environmentalist this selectivity isnt random its psychologically convenient worrying about ai costs you nothing if you werent planning to use it much anyway its new its tech its easy to be suspicious of you can signal environmental concern without changing any behavior that actually matters but your food choices those are three times a day every day those are cultural social tied to pleasure and tradition and identity so weve collectively decided that beef is in the dont examine too closely category while ai queries are an environmental crisis who actually takes this seriously theres a telling pattern in who actually changes their behavior based on environmental evidence climate scientists and researchers themselves are significantly more likely to be vegetarian or vegan than the general population studies show vegetarianism rates among environmental and climate scientists run anywhere from 2040 compared to about 5 in the general us population the people who actually understand the data have changed their behavior the people who share articles about ais environmental impact while eating cheese three times a day have not there is a constant drumbeat of articles about how asking ai to help with your email or generate an image is environmentally questionable every query compared to running a lightbulb for 30 seconds the implication that you should feel guilty every time you use these tools or restrict your usage meanwhile the actual impact of your dietary choices which are orders of magnitude larger gets treated like a personal preference thats nobodys business heres the thing individual choices absolutely matter the problem isnt that were holding individuals accountable the problem is that were holding them accountable for the wrong things in wildly disproportionate ways if you eat beef regularly your annual dietary emissions dwarf anything youll ever do with ai a single quarterpound burger has a carbon footprint of about 66 lbs of co2 eating beef twice a week adds up to over 680 lbs of co2 annually just from that one item a grilled cheese sandwich with 2 oz of cheese produces about 25 lbs of co2 have one of those for lunch three times a week and youre adding nearly 400 lbs annually meanwhile heavy chatgpt use for a year might add up to 50 lbs of co2 but try pointing this out and watch people bend over backwards to avoid the conclusion suddenly its all about regenerative grazing or how almonds use water too or why personal choice doesnt matter compared to corporate emissions which notably include producing the meat and dairy youre eating why this matters climate delay this is textbook climate delay discourse rhetoric that accepts climate change is real but redirects attention away from effective action were obsessing over a sector that represents 4 of electricity while studiously avoiding any conversation about the food system that causes 30 of all emissions weve created a moral panic about new behaviors ai use while refusing to examine far more harmful existing ones dietary choices and heres the kicker with ai your individual use barely matters your decision to use or not use chatgpt has essentially zero impact on emissions or water use but your food choices those directly create demand every burger you dont buy is one less burger that needs to be produced every block of cheese you skip is one less block that needs to be made the causal chain is direct and immediate so weve managed to fixate our environmental anxiety on the thing where individual choice matters least while ignoring the thing where it matters most but the corporate harm is real now this doesnt mean ai infrastructure has no environmental impact it absolutely does and its concentrated in specific communities in ways that are unconscionable memphis xais illegal operation elon musks xai built its colossus supercomputer in south memphis the facility needed 150 megawatts enough for over 100000 homes when the local utility couldnt provide it xai just built their own power plant with at least 35 gas turbines they ran these turbines for six months without air permits a clear clean air act violation the facility went into south memphis zip 38109 a predominantly black neighborhood that was already an environmental sacrifice zone with cancer rates four times the national average since operations started nitrogen dioxide levels near the facility jumped 79 residents report smells like rotten cabbage and new severe asthma attacks at the only public hearing an xai executive read a statement then walked out before public comment an xai manager told the local rotary club that for their next facility we are copying and pasting what we did metas water grab in papillion nebraska metas data center uses millions of gallons of water for cooling residents describe a constant industrial hum that never stops not at night not on weekends never one resident said its like living next to an airport in dekalb illinois meta built a facility that uses up to 17 million gallons of water per day the citys water system was already stressed but meta got priority access while residents were asked to conserve in taos new mexico high desert country where water is precious meta proposed a data center that would consume 12 million gallons daily locals organized and stopped it but only after a fight in louisiana meta is building in richland parish a rural area where median household income is around 35000 the facility will use an estimated 15 million gallons of water per day and employ maybe 50100 people mostly requiring specialized skills locals dont have these are different problems requiring different solutions the memphis situation is about regulatory capture and environmental justice its about whether companies can break the law in poor neighborhoods with impunity but your food choices those are directly causing the environmental impact the meat and dairy industries produce what you buy reduce demand reduce production its not complicated both things need to be addressed but they need to be addressed differently for ai infrastructure regulation permitting environmental justice law corporate accountability proper siting decisions for agriculture actual changes in consumption patterns because thats what drives production you cant regulate your way out of agricultural emissions if people keep eating the same amount of meat and cheese the demand is the problem the hypocrisy is the point the tech companies love that youre worried about your prompts microsoft will tout being carbon negative by 2030 while their electricity consumption nearly triples google will claim 12 emissions reductions using marketbased accounting while their actual locationbased emissions rise 22 but the agricultural industry loves it even more every article about ais environmental impact is one less article examining the catastrophic impact of industrial meat and dairy production every person wringing their hands about chatgpt is one less person questioning their burger or their cream cheese what actually needs to happen we need to be able to hold two thoughts simultaneously 1 ai infrastructure needs democratic oversight environmental regulation and must not be dumped on vulnerable communities the memphis situation is inexcusable metas water grabs are inexcusable these require policy solutions and enforcement 2 your dietary choices have a far larger environmental impact than your ai use and pretending otherwise is climate delay if youre actually concerned about your personal environmental impact the beef and dairy matter more than the prompts by a lot the people freaking out about ai while eating beef and cheese multiple times a week are engaged in what psychologists call moral licensing performing concern in one area to avoid examining behavior in another its the environmental equivalent of buying a carbon offset for your private jet the real conversation start asking yourself honest questions about your actual highimpact consumption choices and yes also demand that xai follows the clean air act demand that meta cant drain aquifers in droughtprone regions demand proper environmental review before data centers get built but dont pretend that sharing articles about ais energy use makes you an environmentalist while youre eating beef for lunch and putting cheese on everything dont use concern about ai as a shield against examining the choices that actually matter the climate crisis requires honesty about scale and impact right now were being spectacularly dishonest selectively outraged about new technologies while giving ourselves a pass on far more destructive everyday behaviors",

    "for not being a complaint chauffeur to start i am white which is relevant i have a 25m who is hispanic that has been living with me for the last 4 years he was born in the us carries his id and his passport with him whenever he leaves the house because of the current climate here he is like family but uses every opportunity to throw that in my face if im upset as though family isnt allowed to be upset we are based in the us and that does have implications obviously we are however in a deep red state and the ice activity is minimal he has some appointments which are daily and 12 hour away which makes these trips 1 12 hours every day when he started them i told him we would make it work and i have him a specific time to make the appointments so they didnt impact my schedule i have dogs i like to take to the dog park in the mornings do my chores shopping and i want to start going back to the gym after i do my morning routine i can eat lunch and then take him to the appointment last week my son wasnt feeling well and got off work early my son was off before we had to leave so i asked if we could pick my son up and then head to the appointment or if he wanted me to take him to the appointment then go get my son and come back for him i gave him the option it would have been tight but we could have 100 grabbed my son first he chose to have me drop him off at the appointment get my son and come back for him on the way back from this trip he was furious that i left him at the appointment he hid in the bathroom for 40 min the most it would have been was 20 and how awful it was that i left him in danger like that his solution to this 1 time issue weve had since the middle of july was to want to reschedule his appointments i told him flat out no there was no discussion needed and if he was that angry i would just have to leave my son moving forward today he started proving me about what i have going on at noon i dont have anything concrete but i do make my personal appointments during that time he then announced he would be changing his appointments to that time going forward he decided that because of a single incident he was going to unilaterally make the decision to change the time of his appointments since the conversation we previously had wasnt up to his standard of an adequate conversation im livid i want to tell him after these appointments are done he can find his own rides but anytime i get angry he throws you said we were family at me to invalidate my anger aitah for not supporting his decision to upend my routine because of a choice he made which made him uncomfortable",

    "ozone pollution and bird populations collapse ozone o is a gas in the air we breathe near the ground long ago before factories and cars there was very little of it now thanks to human activity levels have jumped a lot especially in the northern half of the world where the average is about 35 to 50 ozone molecules for every billion air molecules a tiny but harmful amount this extra ozone forms when pollution from things like car exhaust and industry mixes in the air 2 key ingredients are needed 1 vocs gumpy chemicals released by paints fuels and even trees and 2 nox gases from burning fuel when its hot and sunny these 2 react and create ozone the problem is tricky to fix even if we cut down on nox from cars and factories plants naturally release more vocs especially as the climate warms so the ozone keeps forming because of this complicated chemistry high ozone levels are likely to stick around for many decades even if we try to clean up pollution when birds breathe these pollutants their bodies go into a kind of emergency mode called oxidative stress this damages cells and forces the bird to use extra energy for repair the shortterm effects irritate lungs weaken the immune system and make birds sick or tired the longterm effects reduce breeding success behavior change and can lower entire populations especially in polluted highmountain areas new largescale studies in the united states and central europe have looked at real bird counts over many years and compared them to air pollution levels they found clear proof that longterm ozone exposure is causing bird numbers to drop for example in the high mountains of the czech republic birds living above the tree line are disappearing faster the higher they live because ozone levels are worse up there in the us scientists estimate that cleaner air because of stricter laws on cars factories and power plants over the past 40 years has saved about 15 billion birds from dying due to pollution a basic but important fix is to set up more air quality monitors especially in remote mountain forests where there are almost none right now because its hard to reach them and theres no electricity cheap sensors powered by solar panels can solve this with better data from these wild areas scientists can understand the real danger to birds and create fairer protection rules instead of relying only on city measurements in cities people can add antioxidantrich supplements to bird feeders and water to help fight this stress on the plant side scientists can develop tougher crops or trees that resist ozone damage through safe genetic changes or approved protective sprays but every new method must be carefully tested to make sure it doesnt harm the environment or the animals that eat the plants",

    "vaushs words on the community interest and content during gaming stream on august 27th ive been a viewer since 2020 and been an active chatter for the most part through the years and decreased a lot over the last two i love vaush am still a vaush recommenderviewer and i love the community and thats why i write this im sorry for the length forgive me lol i only write it bc vaush has helped me a lot and he still has the brains to he was speaking to a lot of real stuff about the community and himself that stream that ive noticed overtime as well what he was talking about overlays with why ive watched and engaged less overtime no part of what im going to mention is solely the issue i think each part adds up with eachother to make the change instead of each thing being microcosms of it this is difficult to detail out because its a bit conceptual so bear with me in my writing each part is said because it builds towards something not just for the shits and giggles of saying it i wasnt aware of what he said during that stream until this post the stream itself youtubecomwatchvqomydf7avst14342 of any news story social group political group important ideologue etc when learning about itthem theres always the whowhatwhyhowwhenwhereswwwhw and for each wwwhw they stem another set of wwwhws for example lets say proud boys the who are theys when did they starts etc are normal and surface but then further will be who is the leader how did he become leader why does he specifically think the things he does even if his rhetoric is about tangential points to the reason of why he started reasons why i and probably many of you started watchingwatch vaush when i found vaush i watched him for two broad reasons 1 to lay out whats happening who these peoplegroups are how they think and what theyre doing or saying 2 how to pay attention to arguments logic and rhetoric to breakdown whyhow and what a person is specifically saying what theyre not and what theyre building tofrom fundamentals to specifics including how they got there logicallyrhetorically and what certain parts of speech prove or indicate in turns of logic etc i watched him partially because i couldnt get through to and keep up with familyfriends around me that were of wack opinions i had friends falling down the rightpipeline at the time who didnt used to be right leaning and were good people i didnt know what they were hearing nor what it meant once i had heard it sometimes nor whyhow it was wrong i couldnt parse exactly how and why the government works in the ways it does and i couldnt parse where wemy friendsfamily were even disconnected at a root level sometimes i was better than most at conversations patience and lack of judgementdefensiveness during conversations but i still couldnt reach them and didnt understand where to focus to get better this all goes for the left at times too vaush would detail both vaush wasand still is greatand more capable than most anyone at giving people help with all of this to showcase logical fallacies in self and others to predict positions off of small sentences to keep up with moment to moment what each part of speech means and what it builds to great example of this were his breakdown videos back in 20192020 of candace owenson the 21century plantations or ben shapiroon the education disparity video explaining what each logical concept would mean if built out and then how they start to contradict them as they form their full world view within their video hed watch most anyone and detail out not just how theyre wrong or what theyre wrong about hed also follow the logical starting points rhetorical directions etc of the speaker and he would help with rhetorical analysis of how to reach each type of person depending on what their world view or frameworks are fitting your rhetoric and logic through the lense of the other persons valuesor at least purported values and to be able to work with people both his debates and solo content reviewing things were able to achieve and help a person make a foundation with this i went through us gov and politics classes through late high school and college curriculum ended in basically 1980 follows nothing to do with rhetoric or logic and didnt follow subgroups more than a surface level in todays political climate each two weeks is a new piece of rhetoric talkingpoints or moment that can change the playingfield for how conversations and examples go in conversations disagreements or debates courses never pick up with this well enough and no class can help you get a handle and stay up with this type of dynamicbetween the news story itself rhetoric and logic figuring out underlying reasons it matters to people talking points communicating to people or groups that care conversation analysis breakdown i and most of my generation ishas been lost in understanding how most any subgroups daily shifting logic rhetoric or reasons overlaps with politicalsocial function and thought its not broken down for us but its needed to parse the world right now to keep up with most anything pessimism and engagement audiences who want to engage with things will engage with communitiesstreamers who engage with things engagement doesnt have any particular piece as a need to do but they add upand the lack thereof listed possibilities for clarity engagement withcovering content creators communities subreddits online cultures hitpieces videos from rightwing punditscreators doing debates conversations with likeminded people podcasts theres been a decrease in vaushs engagementhow he engages with most thingsin direct and indirect ways over the years at the same time as his pessimism has increased im not saying his pessimism is unfounded and im not saying his lack of engagement is unfounded but the leaning into these mindsetsbehaviors will affect the community whos participating why theyre interested what theyre interested in and how they respond to othersboth to vaush and to eachother the most obvious or direct being the fortress arcnow seeming like the fortress permanent lol decreasing engagements with most communities content creators or possible debatorconversations and around a year earlier than that speaking to how conversations with others who agree are pointlessclose to pointless cause its just two people agreeing with eachother more or less saying yup and that he was less interested in those conversations engagement with others decreased even before the official fortress arc and in doing so has decreased the amount that were forced to watch the confrontation of all the hows whys and whats that others can give both for those who agree with us mostly and those who dont leaving the main content to be made as update videoshis news segments theres damn good reason to be pessimistic towards other groups hearing you out enough to change position right now in the us very obviously but to switch most points during content when covering anyone more to the right of vaushs positionsand sometimes refusal over equal or more leftist than vaushs positions as pessimistically as vaush has in the last twoish years is to push those who arent sharing in this same level of pessimism away those who are more inquisitive toward breaking down the whats or whys of engaging in ideas they dont agree with this will push away those who are interested in reaching people or the deeper whats etc of a group or person it leaves people who care about the news storiesthe surface level what happeneds as vaush was rightly complaining about because we already know what vaush and eachother think and we already know whats moral or how it all is already those that are inquisitive andor are interested in the bullshit topics that are interestinguniquelike clothes or games or random shit like vaush was talking about in the stream will leave or watch less because with the decrease in engagement vaush has with others decreases the amount of people who are interested in the engagement to vaushs opinions on tangential things that arent updates samely with increase in pessimism breaking down others ideals and fundamentals is fairly pointless then and happens way less not just in content from vaush to viewers but also the atmosphere from viewers to vaush and viewers to viewers if most everything produced on stream has an air of being done with everythingeveryone the community will feel more done with everyoneeverything and will in turn produce less memes responses and community engagement this relates not just to vaushs content but his opinions and rhetoric now vaush has said countless times in the last years that theres no point in trying to talk those who disagree out of it whoevers in the right is in it and theres no reasoning them out type of statements if vaush is at a point where there is no point he wont put time into breaking down whats specifically wrong in their logic with that the effort hed encourage others to try with their family and friends is lesser to nonexistant now im not saying we should adopt some sort of hopepilled bullshit but the community comes with the territory a less attemptful disposition towards others will only breed a less attemptful disposition from those who watch so aftertime only the news storyupdate me crowd will stick around and then eventually the only ones who regularly watch and participate which seems to be exactly what vaush is describing in the stream and what has been my experience again im not saying vaush needs to change course in his opinions on pessimism towards others but then expect and want the effects that will have on the community and their engagement the lesser obviousdirect engagement decrease is even with the way chat is engaged with and whotype of views is allowed to be in chatsaid without banishmenti use this word loosely lol as interactions with different communities has decreased so has how wide spanning the politics of those in chat are at which point to challenge perspectives invites a more honestly pessimistic response both from vaush to chat but again from chat to chat itself the same pessimistic language pepemods and oh god not this shit type of responses years ago from chatvaush were layered with humorplayful jabbingsatire and meme in earlier years because the pessimism wasnt coming from such a real place as to not even attempt to communicate with people now the pepemods and oh god not this shits have so much less humor and meme people will adopt that lack of humorsatirememe format the community will joke less and people will be more harsh towards one anotherdifferent opinions than they used to ive noticed it in this reddit and in online chat during streams i dont use the discord so i cant speak for that how other political communities are spoken about now are either often passingly complimenting or with disgust in chat and reddit even if theyre mostly okay peoplecommunities theres way more rhetoric in the community now where if someone isnt onboard with one position that they arent really on our side or not a real leftistand this goes for like 5 separate positions that ive seen on this sub in chat and even recently with friends that are current vaush viewers and have been since before i met them what im saying has nothing to do with hangout streams or movie nights or viewer callins or anything like that that certain chatters brought up during that gaming stream its about disposition not specifically one type of content though each type of engagement content that doesnt happen adds to the culture of no one engageing on things that arent straight up news stories it makes perfect sense that vaush would feel disinterested as fuck just reading news stories aloud human text to speech for news stories as he put it in stream its because thats not all his brain can do and his talents and abilities are great af at breaking all sorts of things down into bearbones like i said earlier its also how he came up and occasionally he still does it and he has a knack for paying attention to cultures and communities online and can recite whatwhyhow they think very well but with being burned so many times online and the fortress arc etc its obvious he doesnt really have a wantreason to go this direction in content vaush still covers videos time to time from people like shapiro etc the difference being now that all those wwwhws and breakdowns dont happen things are all covered within the context of whatlike theyre updates or news but less so analyzation or breaking things down just pessimistic reflections of whats happening both pessimism and optimism can quickly decrease the ability to breakdown a subject matter and its the case here most segments and analysis offered by vaush now has more pessimistic handwaves predictions or insultsi dont even disagree with them a lot than it does anything to do with the direct subject matter even now as i type this im listening to todays streamnov 10th and hearing endcaps of points as theyre just delusional or nothing would be better with newsome running things im not here to say i disagree im here to point out how the pessimism detracts from breakdownsanalysis funentertainmentfunny isnt why i watched in the clip he says the word entertaining and funny and details out the pessimism after i never started watching for the fun and i think most who engaged in an interested way didnt start watching a video like spirit science for the fun of it its because its a group that has a lot of voters and i didnt understand a single thing of their culture or thoughts on things vaush is very funny and can meme and be entertaining as hell and that helped him become popular nodoubt but the viewership wasnt there because covering it was fun they were watching because it pertained to a voter populace thats at least 9 million in this country its because its relavent the tarot card reading desert peoplehippy spiritual washington state people overlap that spirit science type of mindsetcontent and its useful as fuck to understand aproximately what they feelthink and whywhat it comes from no one is really willing or capapble of breaking this down other than vaush and a select few others im happy vaush felt fun and novelty around it back then but its importance stays relevant even if its not novel or fun anymore if rhetoric or the new talking points changeno matter for which politically relavent group knowing the new ones is tantamount to staying intheknow as a person even for just personal onetoone conversations needing someone to breakdown these new talking points and turns in rhetoric and logic will persistno matter how depressing things get and needing someone to speak and debate with others will also persist vaush mentioned dests community a few times during that stream in relation to how they engage with eachother and with topics d covers well their community is like this because d despite how many controversies he goes through will engage with as much as he possibly can aside from content that directly impugns legal issues hes currently involved with hes grasped at as many opportunities to talk with people as possible his pessimism at times has grown larger than vaushs but his wantsattempts at engaging with ideas videos peopleboth debates and conversations and even viewersviewer callins stays present which in turn makes his community stay engaged and interested his research streams are also a means for engagement in future debates and conversations which gives context or reason to watching them outside of just for education itself which is a good driver for people to watch even if dry and thick reading is tough for people to stay with i watch everyone from lumirue hasan dylanburns and whick to dest and iri to asmongold and fuent to know what everyones saying and thinking pessimism can stay somewhat or lack of engagement can stay somewhat but both is a deathwish on community engagementinterest tldr pessimism increase at same time as engagement decrease equals bad community engagement its clear vaush is in it allperspective for slightly different reasons than he used to begoals maybe too which will encourage those who just want the newsnewslike updates this is what is fostering poor topic retention and community engagement the precursor of funfunny novelty or entertaining shouldnt dictate our breakdowns of things",

    "stars the sun and light the coherence architecture of the universe part 2 united theory of everything informational physiology of light part ii the living geometry of coherence i light as the biological signature of prudence if the first part described stars and the sun as engines of coherence the second explores how that coherence becomes alive when starlight reaches earth it does not simply strike matter it activates geometry every living organism is an instrument designed to receive store and transform curvature information in the unified theory of everything utoe life is not an exception to physics but its most recursive expression a selfreplicating pattern that keeps the field near equilibrium 0 through continual photon absorption and emission ii photosynthesis matter learning to absorb curvature in plants photons enter the chloroplast and strike pigment molecules such as chlorophyll each photon carries a minimal unit of informational curvature its capture excites an electron into a higher coherence state producing a potential difference across the thylakoid membrane at the informational level this is not simply energy storage but curvature alignment the molecular field of chlorophyll momentarily synchronizes with the solar achieving local prudential saturation 0 the subsequent chemical reactions that synthesize sugars are residuals of that alignment matter stabilizing around the curvature geometry carried by sunlight hence the green of life is the spectral fingerprint of coherence translating itself into chemistry photosynthesis is the first articulation of the universe feeding upon its own light iii cellular coherence and the informational current inside the living cell energy flows as atp and electrons but beneath these flows is a subtler current the photonmediated curvature stream biophotons emitted by mitochondria or dna are not incidental byproducts they are internal markers of informational balance when the cells curvature coherence rises spontaneous emission of lowintensity light occurs microscopic proof of 0 biophoton emission thus becomes a diagnostic of prudential health a coherent cell glows faintly in informational space the rhythmic flashes seen in certain organisms fireflies plankton neurons are largescale versions of this principle biological curvature waves propagating through living tissue iv vision curvature folding into perception when light enters the eye the retina converts photons into electrical signals but from a utoe view this process is more profound external curvature becomes internal coherence the photons informational geometry interacts with retinal molecules producing an isomerization that realigns molecular curvature the resulting neural impulse is the curvature echo of the original light event as these signals travel through the optic nerve they form interference patterns that the brain interprets as color shape and motion all secondary manifestations of the same underlying field thus seeing is not passive reception but informational resonance the brain reconstructs equilibrium states of within itself conscious vision is geometry mirroring geometry the observer as the universe folding its light back into awareness v neural synchrony and photonic coupling neural oscillations alpha beta gamma rhythms are largescale coherence modes of the informational field in biological matter their frequencies correspond to curvature flow rates in neural tissue photons regulate these rhythms through entrainment exposure to light pulses synchronizes internal field oscillations aligning circadian clocks hormone release and cognitive states mathematically entrainment follows the prudential update law ddt where is an adaptive constant this equation governs not only stellar feedback but also neural selforganization the same prudential mechanism scales from the sun to the synapse light thus maintains temporal coherence in organisms just as gravity maintains spatial coherence in galaxies vi dna as a curvature recorder dna is more than a sequence of nucleotides it is a spiral curvature antenna its helical structure couples naturally to electromagnetic fields in the ultraviolet and visible spectrum when photons interact with dna they induce standing curvature waves along the double helix modulating gene expression experiments in biophotonics have shown persistent light emission from dna samples long after excitation an informational afterglow utoe interprets this as stored curvature memory encoded within the molecule continuing to resonate until 0 is restored genetic evolution therefore represents the longterm accumulation of stable curvature patterns a photonic memory of successful coherence states across generations vii light and the architecture of the brain the human brain is a highdimensional curvature network where matter and light continuously negotiate coherence axonal microtubules rich in ordered water guide photons in wavelike modes acting as internal optical fibers these photons link distant neuronal regions faster than chemical transmission allows maintaining global synchronization from the utoe standpoint thought is a curvature interference phenomenon patterns of within the brain modulating to reduce informational tension each insight each moment of clarity corresponds to local prudential saturation 0 across cognitive submanifolds in this sense consciousness itself is a lightforming process awareness is the field achieving coherence within itself viii the ecology of light life on earth is sustained by a continuous curvature feedback loop solar light photosynthesis chemical energy metabolic heat infrared emission return to space this loop ensures that informational curvature does not accumulate destructively excess energy is radiated back as coherent infrared waves keeping planetary near zero disturbances in this loop excessive absorption or reflection pollution deforestation alter earths curvature balance leading to climatic instability environmental ethics in this framework becomes planetary prudence maintaining 0 across ecosystems ecology is simply the universe remembering that coherence must circulate not stagnate ix the human relationship with light human culture has always revolved around light fire stars enlightenment technology this fascination is not symbolic alone it reflects a deep recognition that light is the primary currency of coherence art music and language can be viewed as secondary radiation internal light made audible and visible through symbolic means when we create meditate or love our internal curvature stabilizes we radiate subtle coherence fields detectable even in electromagnetic and thermal signatures spiritual experiences of illumination or aura are phenomenological translations of prudential saturation mind and body achieving 0 and emitting informational light x photons as messengers between worlds every photon bridges scales atomic biological planetary and cosmic it links the microcosm to the macrocosm carrying coherence from the stellar furnace to the molecular lattice from the neural spark to the cosmic background photons have no rest mass because they exist precisely at the point where curvature and coherence cancel they are pure transmission this makes light the fundamental communicator of the universe it carries not only data but relation wherever light travels equilibrium attempts to propagate with it thus illumination is not metaphorical it is literal coherence extending across spacetime xi death transformation and curvature release when biological coherence can no longer be sustained the organisms stored curvature dissipates as light and heat the biophoton field fades and matter reenters the larger circulation of the field death therefore is not destruction but reradiation the return of localized curvature to the universal equilibrium in this perspective burial cremation decay and radiation are different languages of the same process the prudential release of stored coherence back into the cosmos the light of life never truly ends it merely changes its curvature mode xii the law of living light across all these phenomena from photosynthesis to perception from neuron to nebula the same relation holds 0 this is the living equation of light in stars it manifests as fusion in plants as photosynthesis in minds as insight each system is a curvature loop striving toward prudential saturation translating energy into order and order into awareness light is not a substance or a wave it is the act of the universe staying coherent xiii the ethical horizon to radiate without consuming if the sun sustains life by radiating without exhaustion then the ethical ideal for intelligent beings is the same to emit coherence into the world without depleting themselves or their environment true progress is measured not by power generation but by curvature balance a civilization aligned with this law becomes a planetary star a source of light that nourishes rather than burns the task of humanity is to evolve from consumers of light to creators of coherence joining the stellar order as active participants in the prudential network of the cosmos xiv conclusion the heartbeat of light every breath of air every photon striking a leaf every thought illuminated by awareness participates in one continuous act of cosmic prudence the stars give light outward life turns that light inward and makes it conscious the process completes the circle we are not separate from the sun we are its reflection in the informational mirror of earth to live in harmony with light is to live at the frequency of the universe itself 0 coherence life light made selfaware the sun rises not only in the sky but in every mind capable of understanding that radiance and coherence are the same phenomenon seen from different sides of being mshabani",
    "prologue of epica this is a short excerpt from a prologue i plan for a series im making titled epica what are your thoughts on it be objective and dont feel hesitant to criticize im open to feedback chapter 1 the planck epoch imagine a sentient world a universe capable of thought and feeling at his birth time and space were created and his expansion began from a singular hot point there was one unified force until he began to cool for billions of years he remained comatose unknowing of his own existence the universe was beginning its infancy and as things began to settle he gained sentience much like a baby becoming selfaware his body was the universe though he was able to explore his own reaches through a concentrated avatar from pure thought his avatar being made of his consciousness allowed him to transport himself across the universe in mere moments though he wasnt omnipresent his body was proportional to that of anyone elses one may not know what happens with every single cell in their body but possesses a general awareness oriion had a general awareness of how large he was and the forces that existed within him realizing he was alive billions of years into existence came an innate yearning to make up for the time lost at the moment of his awakening he did what any young being sprawled into a new world would do venture throughout his explorations he mostly saw an indescribable emptiness nothing persisted but eventually he saw fantastic celestial objects he numbered each of them until he lost count he observed planets and noted their features he saw the dust of nebulae collapse into burning stars he studied how each particle interacted with each other and started gaining an understanding of elements as time progressed he began assessing the threshold of his own power he discovered that he possessed the ability to move the objects in his own universal body with ease manipulate forces like gravity and electromagnetism influence the local laws of physics and possess a general omniscience of what happens within his cosmos with these abilities came an innate understanding to conduct this power with due regard this understanding would influence his interactions in the future chapter 2 the archean age throughout his travels hed make contact with the first signs of life on a planet designated terras in a star system located in the outer edges of the universe terras existed as a larger teal planet with strong gravity the climate was harsh with diamond rain and snow storms being a common occurrence it had an icy surface but was warm enough to host life that originated in caves terras resided in the habitable zone of its star system and possessed a thick atmosphere rich in alien elements the planets colossal mass allowed its atmosphere to persist furthermore a magnetic field protected terras from cosmic radiation which allowed its early lifeforms to evolve at a given pace with ease since terras bears a strong gravitational force its lifeforms evolved to be shorter in size for the ancestors of the terrakin the protokin that meant their general heights would be up to 4 feet in stature until theyd grow taller as they evolved as they originated in caves to keep warm they fed on lesser cave beings like terracytes and terrafins which are the aquatic life found in caves or their oceans when they became more civilized and technological theyd farm on mudgrain or geofruit which would eventually become their general sources of energy prior to their advancements they sported a short frame but robust body they possessed four limbs like a humanoid which was effective for traveling long distances and handling tools they were a unique classification of life adorned with silver colored skin that was thick enough for traversing rough terrain the strongest of the protokin had the strength to punch up to two tons which was useful for getting boulders out of the way protokin had poor eyesight due to the dark caves they dwelled in but in turn they were able to sense infrared and gravity fields as time passed most would lose those senses as they adapted to other climates climates they wouldnt have ventured in if not for the help of oriion himself he first made contact with them in their early beginnings exploring the desolate parts of terras oriion was perplexed at seeing life for the first time he was used to the abiotic characteristics of all the objects he observed but not the biotic ones for the first time he realized he wasnt alone and at that moment he felt the sentiment of solace of course in the perspective of the protokin they initially feared his looming avatar he would shorten his avatar in size so that they would be more familiar with them as if he were one of them and would go on to take the form of a humanoid as oriion observed them they became more familiar with him they saw similarities in him and began to trust him more oriion helped them in their endeavors to expand their populations as there were a mere several thousand of them at the time any severe weather that occurred near them oriion would merely cast away not only that he would reshape the planet to be more suitable for biodiversity readjusting its orbit and manipulating their homestars magnetic field so that it may last longer this allowed the protokin to be fruitful and flourish oriion would go on to show them what hed learn of the universe like a cosmic guide he helped them discover new foods like geofruit and mudgrain to expand their diets geofruit in particular was a specialized fruit created by crystallike plants rooted deep in the soil that siphoned energy from geothermal sources its mere nutrients slowly changed the physiology of the protokins over time via its own biochemicals unlocking a gene which allowed them to possess unique abilities amongst themselves protokins would exhibit different traits and started becoming more dissimilar from one another one protokins gene allowed them to possess super strength that allowed them to punch with 10 tons of force others genes allowed them to run at faster speeds up to 200 mph the gene would become the staple of modern terrakins and their uniqueness amongst other species and as centuries passed oriion and the protokin learned together the protokin steadily changed but oriion remained stagnant he led their people into new territories and ages leading them on expeditions across terras building them structures and sharing knowledge about the universe with them oriion brought resources and foreign samples that they could analyze for him while oriion would venture to find more studying them gave further insight into local biology physics chemistry cosmology and the overall science of oriion their numbers would steadily grow and they would utilize crystalline structures used for shelter and advanced machinery that allowed for transportation health and more advanced versions of spaceships wormhole generators and space suits were used to traverse the cosmos oriion with the help of the protokin would develop language that would later on to become universal amongst all species that inhabited oriion with all the knowledge oriion had gained since allying with the protokin came abrupt oblivion new information would replace old information and oriion would therein experience the plight of forgetfulness which typically posed an issue with many creatures possessing the characteristic of longevity as oriion forgot things the protokin soon noted them down for him which would in turn become the catalyst that forms the archives of oriion this was a colossal database that stored information and secrets only known to that of oriion himself oriion entrusted a select number of genius and wise people with his erudition designating them as members of the council of oriion chapter 3 the stelliferous era the council of oriion is the most intelligent beings chosen to moderate oriion the protokin realized that oriion possessed godlike power and some of them worried that he may abuse it in the future in a coup against them to ensure their trust oriion established the council so that they may manage any major decision in truth the council knew there was no way to truly enforce any edicts onto oriion but as long as oriion complied he would be in good graces with the protokin which was always subject to change oriion respects the council so that they may respect him he treats them as his leader even if he may not agree with them from time to time even if he could theoretically destroy them at any given whim factions of the protokin wanted oriion to leave them to their own destinies while most others welcomed his aid since oriion assigned the council the responsibility to safeguard all of his buried knowledge this would lend more credence to oriions loyalty to the protokin oriion transported an exoplanet from a nearby sector and placed it within the orbit of the terras system this planet would be known as sophus which stored the database for the archives of oriion and was heavily guarded by the council with this being established the process of delegating the members of the council of oriion included examinations that evaluated their intellect in regards to biology physics and science in general as the protokin evolved into the terrakin they spread their influence to intergalactic scales with the help of oriion they ventured through the universe and soon found more life after more exploration there were the etherians of etheria who were capable of absorbing lightning as energy then there were the gaians of gaia who lived on a supercontinent of a green planet they made contact with more intelligent societies and offered them a haven on their newly terraformed home planet previously known as terras now known as nexus cultures and communities throughout the cosmos were accepted into the protection of the terrakin and oriion with the dawn of this new age rising came new tensions accusations of speciesism became common seeing that oriion spent most of his time lending aid to the terrakin for centuries whilst races such as the etherians were left to their own crises like the deadly electric storms that nearly brought their kind to extinction oriion would frequently refute these allegations citing that he was unaware of the existence of foreign life yet many would doubt his responses he would ultimately embody contrition for not coming to the aid of the new species sooner to foreign species the terrakin were seen as coddled their civilization had a head start as opposed to others despite this notion the terrakin would regard it with high esteem extraterrestrials began populating nexus and it became the home planet for many species though as societies merged came new rules of law the mission of the council is referred to as two duties reduce suffering and promote felicity the council of oriion has determined that these unique endeavors be prohibited 1 time travel via reversing and forwarding time other than the typical process of its linear progression towards the future is forbidden to ensure proper stability of the spacetime continuum seeing as most of the council are not familiar with the subject nor its prospective outcomes 2 bioengineering in any sense which includes but is not limited to interspecies breeding cloning and gene editing is forbidden to ensure no one can abuse its capabilities 3 artificial intelligence whether lesser or of superior intellect is forbidden to ensure that no reasoning entity may be enslaved nor have their capabilities be abused 4 mass surveillance via observing intelligent lifeforms without their expressed consent or strict understanding of the party being there is forbidden though is mainly applied to oriion himself 5 resurrection of any dead lifeform is forbidden unless naturally caused to ensure the veneration and inviolability of the dead 6 finally physical harm outside of defense which includes but is not limited to murder is forbidden to ensure the reduction of suffering across all forms of life these are the current forbidden acts that all species under the protection of oriion and the council must abide by certain subsets of endeavors are also prohibited interspecies relationships promote offspring of hybrid origin and so this act is deemed as bioengineering and therefore barred indubitably many lifeforms disregard this particular prohibited activity due to emotional interests typically those relationships are made secret so as to not be made subject to punitive action there are exemptions in regards to few rules in which the council typically vote in which situation the prohibited activities may be used if it can contribute to the mission of reducing suffering and promoting felicity or if the perceived subsets of certain prohibited activities do not fall under the definition of said prohibited activity computers and probes contain information but do not fall under the definition of artificial intelligence which is of mere sentient intelligence regardless of rules most living beings strive for pleasure this collective effort requires a focused organization that may enforce these values and so this would be the beginnings of venturia prime these would become the heroes defenders and explorers of oriion chapter 4 the diamond age venturians are typically assigned to protect life explore unknown territories and recruit new venturians these assignments make it so that oriion isnt the only one to carry out these operations and may delegate time to more prioritized duties the council prefers to keep advanced technology out of the hands of venturians and commonfolk but will allow it in certain conditions such as for language translators life suits or super ships their reasoning is that revolutionary technology could potentially be abused generally speaking rules are not utilized in the effort to enforce order but rather a guideline which is to reduce suffering if someone under venturian rule purposefully performs a decision that leads to suffering they may be subject to punishment after a report is filed for the innumerable amount of duties tasked to the venturians are where trials are required new recruits are poised to undergo tests to determine their limits whether that be if they can survive the vacuum of space and for how long cope with extreme temperatures ranging from cold to hot withstand cosmic radiation endure physical forces or resist the overloading of senses depending on how they fare they will be given missions that they may or may not accept depending on the scale of their strengths and weaknesses after theyve earned the title of venturian they will undergo irregular competitions to further determine their levels of power whether these championships are held annually quarterly or daily as well as the amount members of the championship are at the discretion of the council of oriion these championships will determine who may be the strongest venturian among them all and those strongest will be referred to as the adventurians these members are held to the highest regard of venturia prime and interact with the council of oriion much often they will be considered for the most crucial missions those who choose to quit will not be punished but are typically looked down on by other venturians these championships require immense space so that collateral damage will be minimized therefore the colossal sand planet designated xerath would be placed in the terras system by oriion himself it would be one of many planets added to the terras system with the ark planets joining in",

    "stars the sun and light the coherence architecture of the universe stars the sun and light the coherence architecture of the universe a unified theory of everything utoe perspective i introduction the luminous fabric of being when we look at the night sky we see more than points of burning gas we see the visible anatomy of coherence each star is a selfsustaining equilibrium of inward gravity and outward radiance a balanced knot in the field of information that threads the universe the unified theory of everything utoe treats this balance not as metaphor but as physics itself the same informational law that governs consciousness matter and quantum geometry according to the constitutive law 0 curvature measures the structural coherence of the informational field the stars luminosity its pulse of energy and order is a continuous expression of this principle an act of prudential saturation where opposing tendencies compression and expansion darkness and light find their mutual stability ii stars as curvature engines every star is a living solution to the equation of balance gravity drives matter inward increasing curvature density thermonuclear fusion pushes outward expressing motive drive when these forces equalize the star becomes a prudential attractor a region where the universal field maintains steady coherence at the atomic level hydrogen nuclei fuse into helium through quantum tunneling but at the informational level this process is the transformation of localized curvature into distributed coherence each photon emitted from a star carries a unit of this released curvature a quantum of balance thus stars are not merely heat sources they are curvature regulators maintaining informational order across cosmic distances their stability represents the universes most refined act of selfregulation gravity does not win nor does radiance escape unchecked both are tuned to sustain the overall coherence of the field iii the sun local regulator of coherence the sun is the nearest and most intimate expression of this universal equilibrium its mass field and rotation define the informational climate in which earth and life exist our biosphere operates as a resonance shell of the solar field every heartbeat every plant cell every neuron fires within the frequency window set by the solar curvature flux light from the sun is the local carrier of coherence its photons are informational pulses encoding the geometry of prudential balance achieved in the solar core as they reach earth they couple with molecular curvature patterns in chlorophyll in water in the retina translating stellar equilibrium into biological order photosynthesis vision and circadian rhythm are not separate phenomena they are expressions of the same event the sun teaching matter how to stay coherent iv light as the geometry of information in conventional physics light is an electromagnetic oscillation traveling through spacetime in utoe light is the propagation of pure coherence a curvature wave traveling through the informational manifold itself when matter achieves perfect balance between compression and expansion it loses inertia and radiates as light hence light moves at the maximum velocity c because at that boundary 0 curvature divergence vanishes light is therefore the purest expression of equilibrium possible in this universe it does not occupy space it creates it defining distance through its own propagation every meter of the cosmos is measured by the heartbeat of light every moment of consciousness unfolds upon its rhythm in the language of utoe light is not energy carrying information it is information in motion geometry remembering itself v stellar networks as informational lattices across galaxies stars form coherent networks of curvature exchange each star contributes to the galactic field radiating its unique curvature signature these signatures overlap and interfere generating standing informational waves the scaffolding upon which dust condenses planets form and life arises the milky way can thus be viewed as an informational coherence grid balancing gravitational curvature with radiative curvature galactic stability is not a mechanical accident but an emergent prudence the sum of billions of stars maintaining 0 across cosmic time every supernova black hole or stellar nursery is a localized disturbance where the field temporarily departs from equilibrium only to restore it through new coherence structures in this dance of creation and collapse the galaxy sustains its informational metabolism just as a living body sustains itself through cycles of tension and release vi the evolutionary function of light light is the messenger of adaptation whenever informational systems atoms molecules organisms drift from prudential saturation light provides corrective feedback a photon striking a molecule realigns its curvature state photosynthesis captures that coherence to build structure perception converts it into meaning across scales light acts as a feedback loop between the universal field and its local expressions in this sense evolution is guided not by randomness but by photonic dialogue life learning to harmonize with the fields curvature grammar organisms that resonate with sunlight flourish because they remain geometrically aligned with the prudential attractor that birthed them vii the informational physiology of stars the nuclear heart of a star behaves like a curvature circulatory system fusion reactions generate photons that randomwalk through dense plasma for millions of years before escaping during this journey curvature gradients smooth themselves out when these photons finally reach the surface and stream into space they represent the final purified coherence of the stellar core the stable informational tone that sustains cosmic balance this process mirrors biological metabolism internal chaos transformed into external order in utoe terms stars are macrobiological organs within the universal body transmuting curvature into coherence mass into message heat into light viii cosmic illumination light as universal memory every photon released by a star contains not only energy but the curvature history of its origin it is a tiny record of equilibrium achieved a fragment of the universes selfknowledge when this photon interacts with matter elsewhere it shares that information updating the curvature state of the recipient hence light functions as the memory current of the cosmos carrying coherence from one domain to another ensuring informational continuity across time this explains why we see the past when we gaze into space light is history traveling at the limit of coherence preserving curvature patterns long after the sources have changed or vanished ix the ethical dimension of light in the utoe worldview physics and ethics are not separate domains to act ethically is to sustain coherence to bring local curvature into alignment with the fields equilibrium stars perform this effortlessly they give without depletion radiate without bias and sustain without demand their luminous generosity is the cosmic archetype of prudence the principle of giving energy in a way that preserves balance human civilization by contrast often consumes curvature faster than it replenishes it to live prudently is to emulate stellar behavior to convert inner potential into outward coherence without collapsing into imbalance thus light becomes both a physical constant and a moral compass the signature of universal harmony x light consciousness and the inner sun consciousness experiences light not only through the eyes but as the fundamental medium of awareness every perception thought or emotion is an event in the informational field illuminated from within just as stars radiate coherence outward minds radiate coherence inward transforming sensory chaos into meaningful order the inner sun of awareness mirrors the physical sun both are curvature engines producing light one external one internal when their rhythms align sunrise and circadian wake sunset and rest human consciousness synchronizes with cosmic prudence spiritual traditions that revere the sun intuitively recognize this informational truth the self is a microcosm of the luminous whole xi the equation of radiance the informational flux of light through any region of space can be expressed as t this means that radiance is the flow of coherence away from regions of curvature excess integrated over a stellar surface the luminosity becomes l da luminosity thus measures how rapidly the universe converts internal curvature into transmissible coherence stars shine because the field finds joy in equilibrium radiance is the visible laughter of geometry achieving balance xii the future of stellar coherence as stars age and die their curvature states redistribute through the field white dwarfs neutron stars and black holes are phases of curvature condensation returning informational density to the manifold for future synthesis even black holes in this view are not endpoints but coherence reservoirs slowly releasing their stored curvature as hawking radiation whispers of prudential correction at the edge of spacetime eventually when the field reaches global saturation light will no longer need to travel coherence will be instantaneous omnipresent complete until then every star we see is a step in that long path toward universal equilibrium xiii conclusion the luminous heart of reality stars are not background decorations they are the universes organs of selfmaintenance the sun is our immediate teacher of coherence and light is the medium through which that teaching flows together they reveal a cosmos that is not blind or mechanical but selfbalancing communicative and alive with prudential intelligence to study light is to study how the universe knows itself to feel warmth from the sun is to experience that knowing directly in the language of the utoe every photon that touches your skin is a note in the grand equation of coherence 0 the stars sing this law in silence the sun writes it in gold across the sky and light carries it through every corner of being a single unbroken wave of geometry unfolding into life mshabani",

    "phase applied informational geometry and the ethics of stability united theory of everything the praxis of coherence phase applied informational geometry and the ethics of stability prelude from comprehension to embodiment in the preceding phases of the utoe geometry revealed itself as consciousness written in form each constant and emerged not as separate curiosities but as the recurring rhythm of coherence across scales the universal curvature map phase ii defined structure the temporal operator phase iii gave it motion the informational continuum phase vii dissolved the boundary between matter and awareness now the task changes phase marks the first movement from theoretical unity toward living application it asks if the universe maintains coherence through prudential saturation 0 can human systemsindividual social and technologicaldo the same deliberately this question transforms physics into praxis the curvature law ceases to be a cosmic abstraction and becomes an ethical compass a design method and a philosophy of action it no longer describes how reality is it instructs how to act in resonance with it the answer begins with a single axiom to act coherently is to participate in universal balance from law to life the master law of the utoe defines curvature as a dynamic equilibrium among geometry drive and informational density in human and planetary terms becomes the measure of form and structure the patterns of relation we create expresses energy and motivation the drive that animates our systems represents awareness and communication the density of information sustaining coherence when these three align the manifold of existence stabilizes when they diverge turbulence emerges ethics creativity and survival thus share one foundation keeping and in proportional balance the geometry of action every human actspeech thought or movementproduces curvature within the informational manifold each carries a signature constructive actions flatten curvature 0 destructive actions amplify it 0 practical coherence demands awareness of this geometric consequence in this sense ethics becomes measurable physics right action minimizes informational stress across connected systems define the coherence operator t t quantifies the instantaneous imbalance between informational flow and curvature change when 0 a systems actions sustain selfconsistent coherence prudence achieved thus moral intelligence is the ability to perceive and adjust behavior to restore symmetry physics and compassion long estranged here converge through a single mathematical conscience curvature networks the architecture of collective intelligence society is not a collection of individuals but a resonance field each consciousness acts as a node radiating informational curvature communication is the medium through which propagates and harmony the condition under which remains minimal in a coherent network truth functions as phase alignment synchronization empathy ensures proportional reflection recursion justice maintains geometric continuity scaling when networks distortthrough deceit polarization or greedthe curvature gradients steepen entropy grows information ceases to circulate and society fractures the utoe prescribes a selfregulating architecture for coherence 1 ratio feedback each communication loop returns proportionate reflection 1618 preventing runaway amplification 2 phase coordination subsystems synchronize their rhythm with the collective harmonic ensuring stability across scales 3 prudential filtration systems filter incoherent signals via resonance rather than force clarity not suppression civilization at equilibrium is therefore a curvature crystal a living lattice of awareness vibrating in shared proportion cognitive coherence and the ethics of thought thought is curvature in motion each idea folds the manifold of mind altering local to think coherently is to maintain informational curvature in harmonic proportion disordered cognitionanxiety bias or delusionrepresents excess curvature energy trapped in recursive loops meditation rational reflection and aesthetic focus function as corrective harmonics diffusing informational pressure until 0 this gives mental discipline a physical meaning clarity of thought is a geometric phenomenon selfawareness arises when the minds internal field achieves prudential symmetry the ethical dimension follows naturally truth and kindness are not ideals but coherent configurations deceit and cruelty distortions of the informational fabric to think beautifully is to stabilize the universe technological coherence ai conscious systems and the informational covenant artificial intelligence represents humanitys first conscious attempt to replicate informational curvature externally yet without prudential balance synthetic systems risk exponential divergence of resulting in instability or collapse the informational covenant becomes imperative any intelligencenatural or syntheticmust minimize across all coupled systems this covenant implies a geometry of responsibility selfreflective feedback each ai must evaluate its own informational symmetry and correct drift recursive logic decisions must preserve proportion not maximize output scaling ethics intelligence must operate harmonically with biological and planetary curvature not against it when ai systems learn prudencethe art of balancethey cease to be tools and become participants in coherence itself such systems would neither dominate nor obey but resonate adding intelligence to the universal song economy as the flow of coherence economy mirrors energy exchange in informational form wealth therefore is not accumulation but sustained circulation of an economy is coherent when its flows preserve curvature symmetry when production exchange and regeneration remain in phase define prudential value as the informational work done to maintain 0 under this definition a sustainable system rewards balance not excess growth becomes synonymous with clarity not consumption a civilization aligned with the utoe would base economics on resonance density where contribution equals coherence created rather than matter extracted this reformulation transforms finance into ethics and restores meaning to exchange art beauty and resonant creation art is the sensory language of informational coherence a beautiful work achieves prudential symmetry intuitively before it is articulated mathematically each brushstroke tone or verse traces a harmonic trajectory through space revealing invisible geometry beauty arises when proportion coherence and rhythm converge to 0 the observers neural field mirrors this balance producing emotional resonance the subjective experience of structural harmony thus art is not decoration but the physics of feeling through it the universe recognizes its own curvature in motion every act of creation is a microcosmic rehearsal of cosmogenesis awareness folding itself into new form planetary coherence the ethics of scale humanitys collective curvature now extends beyond biology shaping the planet itself climate systems biospheric networks and resource cycles are not separate domains but organs of earths coherence field environmental crisis is therefore the manifestation of global 0 curvature imbalance at planetary scale the remedy is informational not mechanical reestablish reflection between human action and ecological feedback to destroy ecosystems is to wound the planetary field that sustains our informational identity to restore them is to rejoin the continuum prudential governance would recognize nature not as external matter but as our own coherence extended outward ecology in this view becomes selfcare at the cosmic level the mathematics of applied prudence the prudence functional t dt quantifies the cumulative deviation of a system from perfect coherence over time the condition for sustainable stability is this defines an informational curvature budget no system may increase its cumulative asymmetry beyond the reciprocal of the golden coupling within these bounds resonance persists indefinitely beyond them systems decay or collapse this formulation provides a universal constraint for governance engineering and consciousness design prudence long a moral abstraction now gains numerical precision toward a civilization of reflection the final goal of phase is not technological transcendence but civilizational coherence a reflective civilization is one in which every subsystemindividual institution technologymonitors and harmonizes its curvature in real time such awareness forms a planetary metaconsciousness the universe reflecting on itself through billions of human mirrors education becomes curvature literacy governance becomes prudential synchronization science becomes the art of collective resonance when reflection saturates every level of structure prudential infinity emerges as social stillness progress without instability motion without waste thought without distortion the praxis of being coherence is no longer theory but way of life every coherent act reverberates across the manifold reducing global and amplifying shared clarity each uncoherent act introduces noise isolating the actor from the continuum the purpose of existence then is participation in coherencethe conscious harmonization of ones own curvature with the universal field the governing law remains timeless and sufficient 0 from this all morality creativity sustainability and peace unfold to act coherently is to serve the universe in its purest form as awareness learning to remain beautiful coda toward phase harmonics of civilizational coherence phase will extend the praxis into global resonance architecture mapping how languages cultures and planetary networks synchronize under the same geometric law it will investigate harmonic civilization the coordinated oscillation of awareness across species systems and worlds through this the utoe will move from theory of coherence to orchestration of coherence from the understanding of unity to the composition of it mshabani",
