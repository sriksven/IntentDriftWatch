work grapples with breaking free from animalistic limits toward enlightened awareness influences echoes of modernist poets like ts eliot in fragmentation but with a philosophical bent akin to nietzsche or evolutionary thinkers reception early feedback praises the urgency and momentum but suggests varying line lengths for deeper rhythm his output is growing with recent posts indicating

breaking free is the goal leaving the animal it must do once free it will grow flourish expanding expanding exponentially unlimited potential animal quicksand will it survive escape intelligence infinity awaits analysis of themes in ej walings emergence ej walings poem emergence is a minimalist exploration of transformation and awakening using sparse fragmented language to depict the birth and ascent of consciousness from primal chaos drawing on evolutionary and philosophical motifs the poem frames emergence not as a passive event but as a dynamic contested process below i break down the central themes supported by direct quotes from the poem and insights from available analyses the work resonates with broader existential questions echoing thinkers like nietzsche overcoming base instincts and transhumanist ideas of unbounded growth 1 primal origins and the struggle for survival the poem begins in a state of raw undifferentiated existence symbolized by the bog a metaphor for primordial chaos stagnation and instinctual entrapment this sets up emergence as an arduous rise from base matter where nascent consciousness must contend with animalistic forces the beast represents innate drives and limitations portraying human evolution as an internal battle against regression key lines out of the bog it rose slowly it grew expanded here the enjambed structure mimics hesitant incremental progress building tension evolving in the beast fighting the animal struggling to survive struggling to grow to escape analyses highlight this as a philosophical nod to the shift from mere survival to selfreflective thought with the bog evoking chaotic origins akin to bergsons lan vital or freudian conflicts between id and ego the theme underscores vulnerability emergence is fragile risking submersion back into animal quicksand symbolizing how progress demands constant vigilance against primal pull 2 evolution and increasing complexity central to the poem is the theme of progressive development where simplicity gives way to layered sophistication waling portrays this as an accelerating force with consciousness gaining control and momentum this mirrors biological evolution but extends to metaphysical growth suggesting humanitys capacity to transcend origins through adaptation and refinement key lines complexity increasing controlling ever increasing the repetition of struggling transitions to breaking free illustrating a tipping point where evolution shifts from defense to offense stylistically the short urgent lines create urgency and boundless energy reflecting exponential momentum similar to hegels dialectical progress or kurzweils technological singularity this theme celebrates emergence as creative genesis where initial sparks lead to structured intelligence but it also warns of the painful and contested nature of such growth 3 liberation and transformation emergence culminates in breaking free from constraints framing freedom as the ultimate goal the poem shifts from confinement to liberation where escaping the animal unlocks flourishing this theme explores duality finite vs infinite instinct vs intellect positioning transformation as an existential imperative for authenticity key lines breaking free is the goal leaving the animal it must do once free it will grow flourish expanding analyses describe this as the arc of consciousness rising from primal origins to boundless potential with echoes of sartrean freedom or heideggers authenticity the fragmented style with abrupt enjambments evokes the urgency of this rupture inviting readers to reflect on personal awakenings amid lifes dualities 4 exponential expansion and unlimited potential once liberated the poem envisions boundless growth where consciousness expands exponentially toward infinity this optimistic theme contrasts earlier struggles suggesting emergence leads to transcendence and harmony with broader realities such as ai or ecological awareness key lines expanding exponentially unlimited potential animal quicksand will it survive escape intelligence infinity awaits the openended question adds ambiguity emphasizing potentials fragility yet allure philosophical readings tie this to infinitely expansive intellect critiquing anthropocentrism while affirming creations limitless possibilities broader stylistic and philosophical context walings minimalist approach unrhymed imagedriven with varying line lengths amplifies these themes creating compelling momentum that leaves space for introspection the poem aligns with modernist fragmentation eg ts eliot but infuses it with contemporary urgency probing finite minds against infinite questions overall emergence is a meditation on human potential blending evolutionary biology with existential philosophy to affirm that true awakening lies in perpetual striving toward the unknown if drawing from walings wider oeuvre these motifs recur in themes of duality and selfawareness as seen in excerpts like from the beast a spark growth unchecked into the light",

    "how do i stop modding and start playing heres a few ways to try that who this is for people who want to spend more time playing their modlist and not only be moddingtestingtroubleshooting people with some experience modding and who can be somewhat selfdirected and set limits on how they use their time 1 learn to role play play as a character in the world who is hungry to accomplish particular goals has certain things theyre good at and some weaknesses has a personality has a background doesnt need to be a novel mine are usually 1 to 2 pages of large font double spaced writing by hand 150300ish words why this helps me theres an aimlessnessemptiness i can feel after ive installed a bunch of mods so that just popping into the game with nothing particular im trying to do gives me less of a high than adding more mods that aimlessness can be a trap roleplaying lets me feel driven to do certain things in the world because my character is driven to do those things theres roleplaying guides out there heres a few threads selfplug fudgemuppet guide 2 take multiday breaks breaks between modding time and playing time why this helps me when im moddingtroubleshootingtesting im in the game world constantly looking for things to change stuff thats out of place with the eye of a critic modder perspective i need the eye of an exploreradventurertourist player perspectives to enjoy my time in skyrim and switching between those perspectives isnt something i can just switch on and off giving myself a few days to get hungry for exploring skyrim after daysweeks of modding lets me get one or more of those player perspectives back 3 make a vision of my modded skyrim get a clear idea of what i want my skyrim to be like with clearly defined limits examples that i use for my modlist i want the combat to feel frightening i want environments that sound appealing but that can breathe a bit i dont want to always be consciously noticing the ambient sounds thats why theyre ambient sounds i want days to feel bright and sunny and nightsinteriors to be dark and moody i want a world that feels consistent with itself if theres a war going on i want more signs of that i also want the game to run well over 50 fps in all but the most demanding areas and with cell stutter once every few minutes while traversing ie not on every cell transition once ive built a mod list that does those things its time to play these dont need to be your visiondefining features these are just mine its worth taking some time to come up with your own that work for you but obviously feel free to use these if they fit your modlistvision why this helps me lets me have a point once ive got close enough to these goals where i can switch from mostly modding to mostly playing 4 learn the scope of a new mod build the skill of quickly learning the scope of a mod so i can know what part of my modlist itll impact and where it might be incompatible with my other mods this takes some experience but its worth opening up mods in xedit extracting bsas and looking at file structures looking at source scripts etc doing this to see how much a mod tries to do how it does it how many vanilla filesrecords it changes etc to get a sense of how likely it is to have incompatibilities specifically with my other mods 5 define a must have mod follow up to 3 and 4 for each category of mod come up with a rough threshold of how badly do i want this versus a ceiling of how much potential incompatibility am i willing to live with 6 set limits on my nexus browsing time ill browse nexus for new mods and only download ones that meet my criteria from 5 above for me personally every few days ill sort all mods by endorsements filtering for the days since i last checked and look for stuff that is a must have 5 above or stuff id like to add next playthrough that i think would be compatible with my other must have mods and that i think wont tank my performance i can keep track of this in my modding foldersdocuments 8 below ill only add it to my modlist right now if it lets me follow 7 below 7 protect my current playthrough if a mod is changing persistent references touches a lot things does a lot of stuff with scripts or the authorposts say it needs a new game then make a separate profile for my next playthrough and dont add it to my current playthrough 8 stuff that helps me with all this a more informative console lets you console click stuff that needs troubleshooting and highlight most things and get more info about them this lets you screenshot stuff as you play that needs fixing and you can review your screenshots and go back during a troubleshooting session and fix them b dedicated troubleshooting folderbindernotebook just a place where i can keep documents screenshots of stuff that needs fixing notes related to modding lets me keep things organized so i can more easily separate my time as a modderfixer from my time as a playerexplorer c take notes journal of the dragonborn mod or a similar mod or an actual real life notebook to write about my characters goals for that playthrough roleplay stuff i use both the mod and a notebook",

    "mm25 deep dive breaking news hello my name is hadrien the writer behind breaking news and this is our mm25 deep dive my adventure module is available on backerkit along with 26 other great projects tldr breaking news is a 40page mediafueled faction and investigation module for mothership rpg set on prosperos dream it introduces the oracle a powerful news outlet battling for control of truth through manipulation leaks and propaganda includes tools for wardens and players to publish stories track consequences with a fallout system and navigate the ethics of journalism in a world where truth doesnt last long adds new locations npcs and an optional journalist progression system that integrates with the core classes instead of replacing them the included scenario show no pythia is a noirinspired murder mystery inside the heart of the oracle what this deep dive is about think of this like grabbing a coffee and talking about where breaking news came from why i chose journalism on the dream as a lens pun intended what reallife stories it is built on and how i tried to make it actually usable at the table if you are wondering is this my tables vibe or how did this thing get made this is for you what is breaking news breaking news expands prosperos dream with a new faction and theme information as a weapon the module explores how news leaks and rumors shape the stations politics and survival players can infiltrate expose or even work for the oracle navigating a world of shifting alliances blackmail and moral grey zones its written as both a toolbox and a readytorun adventure giving wardens resources to create their own mediadriven stories or drop show no pythia straight into their campaign the tone sits somewhere between noir thriller and creeping scifi conspiracy how i came to participate in mm25 journey leading to mm25 last year when i first heard of mothership month i was blown away a cooperative crowdsourcing event with 20 different thirdparty content creators around a similar theme for my favorite game mothership rpg i loved the concept ordered so many modules and secretly dreamt of being part of a similar collaborative venture one day the problem was i hadnt published anything creative ever yes my players loved the games and homebrewed adventures i prepared for them for mothership and i loved boiling down call of cthulhu modules to a single guide page but i hadnt yet written anything of my own that gave me the impulse to try i wrote a first trifold called fractal truth as this is often considered the rite of passage for any respectable ttrpg writer and i did love the sort of elegance in sobriety and minimalism that comes with the format i commissioned an artist for the cover and everything but i didnt send it for review not yet i felt i wanted to work on another one almost as soon as i received the art for my first module sleep debt got written playtested sent for review approved and ordered by tkg within a week all of it in seven days only and i never felt any prouder or more energized in months maybe years i had put something out there that i was genuinely excited for and that other players would eventually play as well this gave me so much energy and validation i rarely ever got in my day job mm25 when mm25 was announced i threw my name in the hat and hoped for the best while fearing the worst i had little to no idea what to expect or what it would mean then came this years topic we are expanding on the dream populate this gigantic city with new factions i didnt know what to write about not right away prosperos dream already felt so big and lively to me it felt like a huge responsibility that tkg just handed to us and to make matters worse i peeked at the pitches already submitted by the other creators and felt their ideas were already so formed and developed while i had just read this years topic after a small panic attack and a breather i picked up a pen and paper i am old school like that and started mapping a few ideas it came to me quite naturally information more specifically its use abuse control distribution retention and freeing i am not home while writing this i will take a picture of my notes and share it here later the challenge was that information was already sort of handled by the faction in canyonheavymarket but what do data and computers have as a weakness they are easily falsifiable especially in the age of seemingly omnipresent androids rogue ais and hackers with mods and chipsets plugged directly into their brains yes believe it or not i am talking about mothership not how i sometimes feel society is heading towards so the idea of an oldschool journal and newspaper bringing a mix of tech and grounded methodologies seemed like an interesting twist and way to futureproof things a disaster recovery plan for humanity blending analog with high tech to stay resilient i submitted my initial pitch which i planned to be for a 24page zine we are now comfortably at 40 pages total with the last preview from our layout artist it got approved by tkg and also by the other creators many of whom shared they were excited to have their hands on it many others mentioned it reminded them of the very famous arkyvr big shoes to fill inspirations a lifetime ago in 2018 i moved continents for a job and was acquainted with a canadian colleague who became a very good friend and my main inspiration for this adventure i will paraphrase heavily to avoid spoiling show no pythia the included adventure in breaking news to protect their identity i shall name them ivy and also because i cannot relate ivys story in a way that would do justice to the real tale before being a salesperson in san francisco ivy had a whole other life and none less exciting than selling software yes i am being ironic they were a journalist once for one of the largest canadian news outlets along their career they started investigating a local food processing magnate and his past relationships with the italian mob of new york what started as a small article turned into ivy bringing that mob boss in front of the court after years of intensive investigative work years of evidence and testimonies were diligently gathered all was there for a happy outcome right wrong due to a procedural error a proof became inadmissible weakening the case and leading to the release of said mob boss with a weak slap on the wrist who didnt wait to threaten ivys life as soon as he could ivy eventually had to leave the continent and reinvent themselves while still working for the same journal what struck me most was how ordinary they appeared you could walk past this person on the street and never know the scale of what theyd done the courage the quiet persistence the willingness to stand up to power without fanfare or safety nets it all left a deep impression on me there was something so profoundly cool and human about being an unsung hero even when it came at real personal cost it made me rethink a lot of things about courage recognition and purpose this is what inspired me to write the adventure part of this module i wanted to pay some sort of homage to my friend who stood out in front of corporations greed and threats other major inspirations include psychopass what happens when society is ruled by your psychological stability score and lack of emotional response what happens when you slip when technology fails when you give full power to people who feel righteous enough to exact judgment based on information everyone deems unfalsifiable any resemblance to large food conglomerates agrological monopolies or other media and information giants is coincidental logic and process of writing breaking news tintin in space by fault of not being of the profession and not being familiar with the ins and outs of journalistic life i didnt want to make too much of a caricature of journalism and end up with tintin in deep space horror even though now that i type it it sounds pretty rad for this reason i consulted as much information as i could gather online thank you youtube but also got in touch with investigative journalists not influencers but people who investigate crime fraud and trafficking and had them review my draft especially the description of the oracle as a faction and journal the building and map descriptions so you really get a feel for what it is to walk into a newsroom even if i exaggerated the description a little to make it memorable the different roles of the npcs working for the oracle how to submit your own article or story and the ground rules for journalists josh domanski pushing it further than getting some reallife journalist cred i wanted to make sure my first project of this size was as good as i could possibly deliver that is when i contacted josh through a small ad on the mothership discord i reached out to him asking if he could review my draft knowing i am a oneman show he agreed to do an initial pass and then review it again later his work and impact were invaluable josh came with a very professional thorough and expert mindset given his years of experience editing and developing some amazing modules and complete game systems like liminal horror he helped me up my game and i felt that after implementing his advice i had just graduated from some epic ttrpg training program this has been amazing and i will take what i learned from him with me on my next projects i cannot wait to work again with josh and i cannot recommend him enough if you are in the process of publishing something not only did he do the development editing he introduced me to our layout artist golden achiever more about him later in the team section he also recommended two awesome modules i hadnt read at the time picket line tango and arkyvr that became favorites of mine and also inspirations for what i aim to achieve with breaking news in show no pythia you will find some murder mystery elements though not as developed as picket line tango but reminiscent as well as some reporterinvestigation gameplay complementary to what you can find in arkyvr breaking news is a spice you can throw on your favorite adventure while arkyvr feels like a deconstructed caesar salad or the famous oops i dropped the lemon tart a completely fresh take on something familiar wardenfirst philosophy breaking news is not a documentary i researched translated and turned my findings into something i would love to experience as a player and my own players loved it within the essence of the mothership rpg universe when i drafted the different tables to support and bring to life some mechanics for example fallout which helps you handle ingame consequences after dropping a spicy article i made them with ease of understanding for players and ease of use for wardens in mind there is nothing that frustrates me more than when i pick up a book full of good ideas but the rules get in the way of the story so for breaking news i always doublechecked that what i wrote made sense to both pros and beginners was digestible and remained fun for players interacting with these new mechanics through the wardens narration supported by handouts that are currently part of the stretch goals but that i plan to release regardless of the financial goal i always want wardens to have more than they thought theyd get because thats what i wish i got as a warden myself journalist class another question i received in my backerkit community was about the journalist class tldr i decided against drafting a whole new class because i believe people working in a journal come from all walks of life therefore i stuck with the four original mothership archetypes and created three skills reflecting seniority within a newspaper plus an item that influences peoples decisions around you the press badge i am very excited about this i printed some badges and gave them to my players who wear them proudly at the table or hide them depending on how they want to roleplay a scene they are proud to say they work for the oracle when passing a crowd gathering in front of au clair de lune one of the posh restaurants in the module but they hide their badges when getting close to some unsavory drug dealers operating near the farm current status and progress we made a progress bar on backerkit to show how far we have come in the writing and illustration process right now the pdf is close to being done and i am looking forward to seeing what people think of it the team behind breaking news i want to thank both haven and golden achiever for helping me make breaking news the absolute best product it can be and one that i am and will remain proud of haven i contacted haven after checking his portfolio online i loved one of his characters a lot lens little did i know that haven wanted a chance to revisit this character and bring him back to life even though he was very much sought after and had received many requests for commission the theme of breaking news as well as the fact we both thought of lens as a character for the adventure really made the difference after a few calls and exchanges we were on track to deliver what we find to be an incredible experience for the readers having havens incredibly striking art support my text i am so glad and honored we clicked so well and keep on collaborating closely during this project dont forget to check his instagram golden achiever i love working with golden achiever on this project not only does he have a great eye for design and amazing execution he also comes with a wealth of experience handling projects like breaking news and even much larger ones so much so that i asked him to review my first adventure designs to have a v2 available soon and i plan on working with him for future projects too dont forget to check his project the international players review annual a 70sinspired modern rpg zine launching on backerkit in november crosscollab

    "hearing and generating music and talking in my minds ear during semisleep state this morning i woke up and started to fall asleep again but wasnt fully asleep my brain started making music it was real music i was hearing in my head made out of samples of bit of songs and audio all chopped up breakbeat and electronic style it was 100 realistic like i was hearing it with my ears but i knew this couldnt be true this has happened once before in my life about 20 years ago i was fully aware this was my brain making it and i was fully conscious i knew i was lying in my bed in my room the quality of the music was amazing honestly it was like the best headphones you can imagine and the music was so interesting albeit sort of random very much an acquired taste im into weird electronic music anyway so this fits what i liked but there were waves of orchestral sounds then electronic synth drum beats samples of all kinds jumbled but somehow coherent if anyone is interested it most reminded me of wagon christ coldcut and some of the more experimental ninja tune stuff from the 2000s mixed with a bit of opera jazz cafe del mar parov stelar caravan palace and a hint of chilled drum and bass basically like a collective mix of all of the stuff im into i decided not to force anything just to enjoy the experience it lasted a few minutes and then went away i started thinking about my children and then heard my daughter talking as if she was there in the room again it was audio very realistic and she was saying random things being generated by my brain i also felt her presence in the room somehow a sense and its like it was an extra layer of immersion outside of just the talking i almost felt like opening my eyes to check if she was actually there there were words being said but i couldnt latch onto them and i knew if i did i would probably lose it almost like the brains impression of what talking is without it actually bothering to make a full conversation i listened for a few minutes eventually i went to sleep and started dreaming about running although there was an element of me being able to control the dream it was a visual dream and i ran towards certain people and observed how they looked and what they looked like what clothes they were wearing this is unusual for me not just in dreams but in real life i dont observe what people are wearing and im terrible at fashion or things like hair cuts which generally seem trivial to me today in fact im going to buy some clothes and my wife is coming with me to make sure i dont buy weird stuff that will look odd on me as i woke up with my eyes closed i could see a coloured matrix grid mostly black but also coloured patterns of red purple blues and some green almost kaleidoscopic and geometric not the usual random stuff i often see which is usually black with some random mush of colour my wife hyperphant says this is what she sees when she is trying to go to sleep the closest image online i could find was this theory some key observations here are firstly that my brain is capable of generating this sensory information recall and it is possible to send this to my conscious brain whilst i was in a dreamlike state i was conscious and could think about things my theory is the hardwiring is there but the switch of some of the pathways are weak due to trauma suppression and i am working towards being comfortable with visual recall secondly it is interesting to note that i ran towards people in my visual dream and observed how they looked and what they were wearing it is almost as if i am giving myself permission to do this as usually i avoid these details this is the same in reading i have always struggled with descriptive prose and it is actually psychologically painful to read this makes sense if trauma resurfaces through sensory recall my brain would instinctively shut it off i said in a previous post that i recoiled when i started to visualise like a kneejerk response to psychological pain my theory is this is the case and i slowly need to accept that nothing bad will happen if i open my minds eye i have read that edmr can help with this and i will explore this if anyone has any recommendations for an edmr therapist that has worked with aphants please send me a dm i should note that one thing i have been doing is shifting my reading from nonfiction to fiction i usually read business books but i have been reading some trauma therapy books alongside science fiction i was reading alistair reynolds revelation space when i found out i had aphantsia the prose was

experienced a vivid hypnagogic state where my brain created realistic electronic music and lifelike voices while i was halfawake followed by a dream where i could clearly see people and later a coloured geometric grid behind my eyes i think it shows my brains sensory pathways work but have been suppressed by trauma and im gradually reopening them through fiction reading and plan to explore

    "i built up a relationship in my head with someone who lives in a different country i 20m started talking to a girl 20f i met on an online space who lives in a different country we flirted for a bit before she told me that she was talking to someone closer to her like 15 days later it kinda crushed me despite obviously knowing that a relationship wasnt realistic as were both students and couldnt really travel i was kinda distant for a couple days so she knew something was up but we continued talking but stopped flirting like a month or so later she tells me that this guys an asshole and while talking about dating she asks me whether ive liked someone recently i tell her that i like her but didnt say anything cuz i knew it was unlikely something would happen she tells me she liked me back at the time but she sees me as a friend now and accepted that the distance makes it difficult like a month and a half so later she tells me that she likes me again during this time i never stopped secretly hoping that a relationship happens but was kinda okay knowing it probably wont i said were finally on the same page and know we like each other at the same time and she says that we can explore a relationship in a couple months time but can still see other people in the meantime i took the parts i wanted to hear from it a relationship was still difficult and unrealistic but i started imagining flying to her country and meeting her planning an itinerary if she were to ever come here thinking about looking into her eyes and kissing her and stuff like that and all she had said was that she might be open to a relationship a couple of days later she said that its difficult and will probably never happen ive deep down known this all along im not even sure i would even want a long distance relationship and to be honest i think i loved the idea of having a girlfriend more than i actually liked her although i did like her which is super unfair im super lonely and been depressed for a couple of years and had never been in a relationship so unfairly idealised her and built things up way in my head all she did was say she might be open to it and i took it way too far and even before that i still harboured hope right now im in a lot of pain for something that was never real i cry sometimes and feel physical pain in my chest for a simple like she asked me what she should tell me if she starts dating someone and i told her to tell me if shes official and that hurt so much despite her obviously being well within her rights to do so and im kinda terrified of the day she tells me that were still friends and ive thought about cutting contact ive told her this but i like speaking to her way too much to be able to cut her off and i know ill miss her if i did she also clearly likes speaking to me and loves me as a friend despite all this a part of he is still delusional enough to have hope ill graduate and do my masters in her country thats almost 2 years from now im so pathetic",

    "is anyone else a little put off by the s3 poster i know its too early to draw conclusions and the poster ultimately seems more symbolic than serious or at least i hope so we know for sure that for example ltcs childhood has no connection with cxss they didnt grow up together and the same goes for the others but im disappointed that the promotional image emphasizes all the characters together so much especially in their childhood form the reason is that i hoped s3 will be lgs season the first was primarily a cxss pov even when the episodic stories seemed to tell moments in the lives of strangers they somehow highlighted aspects of cxs and provided a way to tell his past the second season focuses on the twins and especially ltc who was originally supposed to be the main antagonist except for the later decision to create vein the way it ends clearly suggested that s3 would be lu guangs and dare i say it finally lg needs his space to tell his story he needs the emotional focus to be on him he also needs to be known independently of cxs not just in relation to his role as savior because this benefits his characterization and ultimately also makes his relationship with cxs multifaceted and not univocal part of link clicks formula is to present each character as having something tragic and unresolved in their past and what i liked most is the way link click manages to address certain themes with a rare psychological realism i dont want lg to be robbed of his deserved space to give it to newly introduced characters i want lg to receive the same treatment as cxs that is to be explored and shown as his own existence which then makes the way he relates to others and cxs more interesting and meaningful what i was hoping for was for s3 to mirror s1 but with roles reversed to delve deeper into the relationship between lg and cxs but if s1 focused on cxss past and his feelings now i would have liked the same thing with a focus on lg depriving lg of all the space he deserves takes away a lot from him as a character and consequently from the potential of their relationship i want lgs childhood i want him to stand out not for his story to blend in with everyone elses",

    "nature of abandonment 100 were at chapter onezerozero baybee lets goooooooo thank you uspacepaladin15 for the wonderful and depressing world of nature of predators memory transcription subject tarva governor of the venli republic date standard human time february29 2137 what cancer have we just uncovered from those depths yesterday i had provided the public with a speech regarding our operations in the federation with the attack on talsk the news that talsk was glassed it was gone the homeworld of the farsul the news shattered the minds of many as one of the core worlds of the federation was simply erased the core worlds which were considered untouchable until the fall of nishtil the vulnerability of the federation was shown no one thought it would get worse than the krakotls fall from grace yesterday i provided the public with a speech regarding the information recovered from ground operations body cam footage from multiple sources of our venlil squad sent down into the archives with the rest of the allied forces footage raw and unedited from what our allied squads discovered in the archives the reveal of the archivist libraries that were abundant within the depths of that facilities in the deeper depths yesterday i provided the public with a speech about the truth of farsul abductions the truth regarding what they did when they initially discovered us kidnapping and cryogenically freezing countless of our people for the sake of study to see what made us tick biologically and genetically they collected all the data they could in order to discover how we could be altered to better fit their vision of a universe because yesterday i provided the public with a speech about the truth of what those monsters did to us the lies they crafted of first contact and the mockery they made of the venlil species skalga the true name of our homeworld was lost to us through the efforts of the farsul and kolshians the skalgans mutilated and abominated by the two races of higher powers for daring to oppose their invasion and their worldview we were once a proud and powerful people strong stalwart and not so easily broken or intimidated by fearsome forces they stood their ground against the kolshians and made them pay costly for conquering our homeworld but for the crime of opposing the kolshians and their proclaimed great truth of the universe they punished us for opposing their violent invasion their cruel invasion for they were evil truly evil for the things they did to us i witnessed it directly on my computer watching all the footage recovered from them stealing our children and burning all they tried to defend themselves and their families once they had the stable population of our species to augment them they sought to punish the skalgans of old even further those that they didnt take in their invasion to change and alter our very genetics they burned everyone else rendering the totality of our homeworld barren of civilization as every man woman and child was tortured with almost religious fanaticism as they were torched in the warmth of flames the screaming of mothers watching their precious littles ones melt away the desperation to fight back against the true nature of the federation revealed to those that havent been integrated into its fold they they made us weak shorter slower our knees abominated in order to produce the desired results of weakness and just as a cruel twist of amusement they took our nostrils the snout we once possessed mutilated with the removal of nostrils they made us weak cowardly mouth breathers and purposely augmented our culture to be as much of a far cry from the capable people we were and capable they were for in direct reports from farsul recovered files on our species we received a more capable combat rating than anything they had encountered even surpassing the arxur and thinking about it thats what really broke me the footage of the crimes the notion that we were a mockery of the people we once were as a punishment for opposing the will of our invaders it was the fact that we were capable in the past we werent weak we werent cowards we werent everything that we were now were a vile abomination of pathetic venlil that could have survived so much easier if we werent made mockeries in punishment of the previous skalgans of old if we were still who we once were we could have fought back against the arxur we wouldnt stampede over each other to hide away in our bunkers we wouldnt end up running over so we could have we could have been the allies earth needed in its darkest hour my daughter my daughter could still be alive countless innocent children once again i threw up into the garbage disposal of my shuttle as i was piloted through the thafki system of trappist immediately being brought to an assembly of allied species only a day after the nuke of truth that rattled my very soul there was nothing about us in this modern era that didnt fill me with a longing for a past we never knew a desire to be the strong skalgan we werent anymore i just want this pain to end tears continued to flow in waves from my eyes even as i finished my hurl i struggled to compose myself as i leaned back pathetically sat on the floor as the lid automatically sealed again as it did the several other times i needed to hurl it hurt everything hurt my body writhing in misery i havent felt since the loss of my family in full i was on the verge of another weeping madness before the shuttle system informed me that we were 5 minutes from docking i struggled to stand my abominated knees writhing for strength that was taken from those monsters the people that made us so utterly weak in efforts to preserve their own visions and ideals of the universe behind every sorrowful weep was a hidden cry of hatred in my heart we wouldnt be so pathetic we wouldnt have lost so many people to the gray menace if we could have had the strength and will to defend our people but no they devolved our very existence and allowed all of this to happen they allowed our weakness which ultimately created the most pathetic species in the galaxy were a laughing stock made this way because of those those vile beasts hiding behind the masks of the benevolent federation that they presented themselves to be to its mutilated and ignorant citizens they were right the humans were right about us all i moved to my mirror in my personal quarters in my shuttle trying my best to dry my tears and make myself presentable i tended to my fur and face i put a stop to the tears the best i could using what formula and spray i could to not look like the shambling mess of a woman i was right now i i want that better life the one where im not this thing in the mirror you you should be taller and where the fuck is your nose you should have a nose when i felt the shuttle shudder as it docked with the thafki station i took as long as i could without moving catching my breath it felt much less air than i should be getting it was i took a deep breath and rubbed my eyes again before composing myself as i have done many times before i was a politician i made my career by being able to mask and this was a time i needed it more than ever i took one more huff before moving to walk out of my shuttle stepping out into one of the several docking hangers that extended off the thakfi diplomatic station i walked through the hanger taking the central catwalk as i made my way to the central chamber the place i was before when we conjoined to talk of the plans to invade talsk initially as i walked towards the main chamber i ended up running into cupo the massive mazic trudged forward with heavy steps his gaze kept low on the ground before him i had access to several other files regarding the archives as well for it wasnt just the venlil data we were provided though it was the one put on the most emphasis on by kam given the severity of the news on our people being paramount to the republic intel i had seen some info regarding other species in the federation some not as extreme or cruel but then there were others who were so much worse at least we had our homeworld looking over at the sivkit ambassador not far from us she looked to be beyond hateful at the news knowing the stereotypes and encouraged views put upon them of being foolish and simple minded she was likely fuming anticipating the chance to strangle some kolshian in penance for breaking their spines and burning their original homeworld to the ground it wasnt just her resentment and vile expressions of pure agonizing anger were seen upon many others as we walked through the halls towards the main chamber as i looked around i then heard a huff from the mazic i walked beside as his gaze turned to me i looked back up at the giant amongst the sapients of the galaxy and awaited cupos statement im sorry i read the reports of what became of the venlil there was nothing you ever did to ever deserve that vile fate i waived a little struggling to maintain my composure i couldnt afford another break down so soon i stifled tears attempting to well in my eyes and nodded in response taking another deep breath to try and calm myself down thank you cupo its nice to know our plight isnt ignored by others suffering their own drastic revelations im sorry in turn i heard about the situation regarding the federations initial plans to dwarf you yes they planned on altering our genetics to make our size more integratable with their own societies and therefore easier to manipulate to know we were so close to being made such miniscule creatures in order to its just even still the mazic were one of the lucky ones in that regard you and many others suffered much worse fates know this you have my support he said nodding down at me it gave me some sense of relief to know that we werent alone we were all suffering in our own twisted histories being revealed in such horrid fashion i took a moment to reflect wondering if there was any way we could have learnt the truth or discovered the reality of our federation without human interference if not for them wed still mindlessly follow the kolshians till the end of all things but then again as soon as cupo and i arrived in the main lounge area before the central chamber doors the doors were preparing to open i guess that made sense i did depart later than others due to some personal issues i was going through back on venlil prime luckily i had noah there to help me through all the drama regardless of the time of day he was always there for me shame i couldnt bring him here with me it would have made the trip so much easier with not being left alone with my thoughts those were the dangerous moments for me especially given all the recent news just getting worse and worse though there was some sense of hope in me knowing that we discovered the worst of it the main chamber began to fill with the leaders which were all informed by the humans to attend the thafki accommodated all leaders of human vassalized or submitted powers i moved to take my seat looking over the chamber as it filled with dozens of people who all looked broken ashamed sorrowful or full of pure hatred in learning the truth behind the federation what kind of people we really were i took my seat and took a deep breath trying to calm down as i rested my hands on my head and leaned onto the desk before me for support i stayed that way for a while simply listening to conversations about me as i tried to keep distracted on anything else from my own thoughts i heard off to the side of the yotuls director going off on chancellor piri about how much he hated the federation and how much he wanted to rip nikonus tentacles off of him one by one a level of aggression which would once be considered predator disease was cast aside as an understanded reaction to the information which was revealed the thafki that accommodated us were also struggling despite the masks that i saw several trying to maintain composed and set to attend to the needs of their visitors but barely able to keep the facade to the bare minimum extent learning the folly of their homeworld being orchestrated and abandoned by the farsul created so much grief from the betrayal of those that they saw and the safeguard for the federations struggling like them it was ultimately the take away in the perspectives of many the federation we held so much faith and trust in that we relied on to save us from the gray menace was nothing more than a front for the despotic assimilators that they were driven into becoming one of the other doors to the main chambers shot open with meier and his entourage of guards flanking his sides the scowl on his face was unapologetically expressed his eyes beady with pure and unkempt disdain behind those irises that seemed to express much less of the soul of the man i was introduced to a good cycle ago i felt concerned once again i was losing that man to his hatred the room stilled itself in its activity and those within settled into their seats even the yotul frothing at the mouth in fury with the kolshians stilled themselves as meier made his appearance the arrival of the human signally the true beginning of the session he stood before the holographic projector in the center of the room as he looked over the collected species all here i take it the culture shock youre all experiencing is extreme he said mitigating the temper of his voice to maintain his presentation before the rest of us his statement however was the understatement of the century to near galactic proportions it wasnt just culture shock its the realization that culture as a whole has been hijacked turning into something else completely were a far cry from whatever we were before said piri the gojid prime ministers facade of composure is stronger than most her gaze was distant as she made her statement known cupo nodded in agreement beside me not only were countless genetically altered into herbivores to stand in line with federation ideals of prey behavior many cases were done with levels of near sadistic satisfaction against the victims he finished his statement turning to me his gaze down at me was one that i understood well as being the example used to back his claim i winced a bit and looked up in disapproval to which he sighed and nodded in understanding turning to face forward and keeping silent regarding the venlils own condition i wasnt yet comfortable enough to discuss it openly however the yotul director didnt shy away from participating in an uproar of seething fury they made us the primitives to keep us outliers not worth the consideration of anyone else in order to maintain our inferiority and ensure our culture was maintained in its appearance as predator diseased they torched so many of our people for seeking to defend our pets and culture all because we didnt bend knee to their tyrannical imperialist ways so many in this room have partaken in the federations endorsed perceptions and belittled us for being primitive and clueless as to the true nature of things in the galaxy tell me how does it feel to finally be proven wrong to know that we were right about you all i shrunk in my seat a bit but glared at the yotul director for this behavior piri especially as sat directly beside the marsupial there was a grim satisfaction in his guise that was easy to see the snarky haveatthee attitude of the yotul to finally be proven right certainly wasnt annoying or out of place in a room of a mood so sour the duerten was about to explode on the yotul for their outburst at the fact let him have this meier interjected holding a hand up to silence the duerten you cant blame and tell off the oppressed for celebrating a development like this against their oppressor that being said much is to be discussed regarding the news primarily with cultural issues he said moving to change the subject as he looked up at the yotul gesturing for them to sit you all saw the cultures you had before from the archives data id like to hear your outlooks on the ways of life you once had do you think they were better than what you have now or are you still under the impression that the culture you have now hijacked by the kolshians is still better and before you say anything technology isnt indicative of cultural quality or improvement so dont you dare say the kolshians giving you all ftl tech was worth it he said glaring down everyone in the room with a gaze indicative of little patience for any federation foolishness he wasnt necessarily wrong either technology which gave the federation so much of its utopic appeal for any loyalist and the impression that all of what we had was only through the federations benevolence with technology being the backbone of our societal integrity it would be likely many would praise the federation saying that they paid their dues for elevating our species technologically into the stars however with meier singling that particular facet of our pasts elevation their immediate option was null and void in his eyes there were quite a few who complained about that aspect coji especially federation technology is far more capable than anything we would have been able to acquire on our own having the ability to traverse through means of ftl opened so many options for us to improve and cultivate a greater civilization than what we had and you idiots really think sacrificing your societal and cultural integrity to federation tampering and mutilation was worth it this argument is nothing more than your own pathetic attempts to double down on your hideous ideals enforced by the federations collective efforts technology as a benefit is indeed something to consider but it was never given out of benevolence it was enforced to ensure that you were distracted by something surface level rather than dig deeper to discover the evils beneath to ensure conformity and uniform ideals to maintain a pseudoscience enforced manner of thinking which holds no merit outside of your cultivated systems he continued looking over everyone present this culture so many of you possess and hold onto for dear life is because all of you are cowards never able to accept anything contradictory to your values and way of life everything the federation has done was to maintain its own idiotic status quo and correct outliers and maintain their predator versus prey ideals to cultivate the necessary foundations to maintain an outright pathetic worldview of white light morality because being wrong is something none of you can accept you fear being wrong because that means you have no ability to see your great enemy as what they are and that leads to selfreflection something the federation seems allergic to as well as anyone who follows their dogmatic values with near reverent faith the silence in the room was palpable no one dared to speak my throat felt like it was on fire as introspection was something i feared not for the reasons meier claimed we all did but because learning more about myself and my people did nothing but hurt me mentally seeing further what weve become but in uniformity we stand strong none of you are strong as the federation made the abominations you all now are youre a far cry from anything else hes right i said aloud garnering attention across the room reinforcing the humans perspective with my own we venlil in particular are an example of the despotic order that the kolshians seek to maintain we were once the skalgans and proud people who were strong stronger than we ever could be now we were able to stand against the federations tyrannical manipulation for longer than most and in punishment for opposing their greater vision we were made these things pathetic mirrors of the people that died defending their way of life to the last man before our ultimate genetic splice into the meek creatures we were we had a combat rating in federation ranks that exceeded that of the arxur and as a mockery to the brave souls that they so greatly hated for opposing their will the farsul and kolshians made us into these weak things that could never hope to rise up against them and in turn never able to fight back against the arxur take a moment to think their efforts to make us weak and meek prey that followed their own perceptions of universal truth made us into fearful incapable people that couldnt oppose the great evil of the dominion they made us into pathetic things which in turn made us into prey for the arxur a fate which persists to this day they made us the socalled perfect prey not just in their eyes but for the sake of arxur consumption and im serious just stop fighting against evidence and think i made my perspective known the recognition that the reason we were nothing but prey and the targets for arxur and their endless raids was due to the federation making us the way we were to fit their rigid and desperate attempts to make their views universal and enforced i recognized that fact and thinking about it made me struggle to maintain my calm i wanted to break down i wanted to cry and find some sense of relief in letting out all the misery at seeing the truth in a light we were never designed to see slowly but surely others started to widen their eyes as consideration of that truth began to settle within their minds with the new information we possessed of our federation and the perspectives stated we started to see a new truth this whole war had persisted by the federations grand design for reality with the arxur being the ones enforcing and justifying the worldview as something absolute we i heard from ambassador loska the thafki representative whose meek voice spoke out against the silence of the chamber our homeworld we were allowed to suffer the fate of near extinction for having tendencies and biology that they feared wanting to swim and to explore the waters we found comfort in all because they wanted to ensure their archives forever remained a secret we we were allowed to suffer to become cattle so we were no longer a rogue element threatening their state security we werent given consideration mercy she said struggling to hold back tears until it was too much to keep contained choking up tears and folding into a ball to try and keep herself collected cupo was the next to speak made subservient to an ideal not our own in order to maintain their values without being questioned refusing to see truth and mold reality into their own twisted state to stay ignorant i i understand now human hatred i hate them i hate them too and im so sorry i wish we were the people that you hoped you could have met that we all could have stood together without this hijacking of our ideals he said to meier the humans eyes shifting slightly the cold and steeled gaze lifting slightly warmed by cupos words however meier was quick to steal his vision again as he moved to address the collective directly once again the federation has abominated your cultures but it doesnt need to stay that way when this is all over well seek to restore you to a former glory because let me tell you this the federation wins so long as people believe their manipulations for we refuse to ever let the federation and its ideals to persist for its crimes the despotic tyrannical hellscape it has created and everything that it holds of value it will be erased down with the federation

    "my current thoughts on the market i got into the market in late 2021 i started dcaing into hbar without knowing anything about the technology it was an impulsive decision driven by the same reason most people enter the space to make money i didnt know anything about the markets the tokenomics or the project itself i began lurking on the subreddit and exploring other resources and after doing my due diligence i realized that i had invested in a very speculative asset while the whole market was trending down luckily im very stubborn so i kept dcaing into hbar and nothing else the running meme eventually turned into reality i became more interested in the technology than in making money or maybe that was just a coping mechanism regardless i stuck it out until november 2024 and ended up making a profit honestly i was too scared to be one of those people who held their coins without taking any profit my average was 007 with a total of 114000 tokens i cashed out around 026 nearly quadrupling my initial investment roughly a 100 return per year over the past four years from a different perspective 100 yearly is very lucrative i took profit and cashed out even though my initial strategy was not to sell until it hit 1 but i had to i couldnt afford to wait another four years im a 24 year old guy with no bachelors degree and no parents money to rely on everything i know is self taught thankfully i got myself a car a bike and im getting married soon all with zero debt for someone my age i feel like hbar gave me that extra push and put me ahead of the average guy in my age i believe this run really is different ai has taken the spotlight from the crypto market this cycle geopolitical tensions and monetary policy havent really changed liquidity is scarce and there are too many projects out there my main point here is if youre overall in profit maybe you should consider cashing out hbar follows btc and broader macroeconomics you cant deny that no matter how much you tell yourself otherwise we saw the recent pump on etf news fade away as soon as btc started to drop maybe we had our top back in january 2025 or maybe not no one knows do whats best for you and remember no one ever regretted taking profits",

be immediately accessible to the general public while assessing potential properties it is crucial to contemplate numerous factors aside from the price the locality dimensions topography and zoning regulations of the land can all influence its value and prospective applications for instance a parcel of land situated near a busy freeway might hold more commercial development value while a larger wooded lot in a residential area could be perfect for constructing a private dwelling it is also imperative to investigate any easements claims or limitations linked to the property as these could impinge on your capacity to utilize the land as desired one means to unearth a discounted plot for sale is to seek out distressed or motivated vendors these vendors might be open to agreeing to a reduced price in return for a prompt sale which can be advantageous from a buyers perspective distressed properties could encompass those undergoing foreclosure bankruptcy or probate as well as properties that have lingered on the market for an extended duration devoid of attracting offers by directly reaching out to the proprietors of these properties or partnering with a real estate agent specialized in distressed transactions you could potentially negotiate a favorable deal on a parcel of land that caters to your requirements and budget another avenue for discovering a discounted plot

instance properties with extraordinarily low prices could conceal underlying issues or faults that might lead to increased expenditures in the long run it is imperative to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the land and delve into its history before finalizing the purchase as this can aid in steering clear of expensive surprises down the road additionally procuring land in a secluded or underdeveloped area could pose challenges concerning access infrastructure and utilities which could elevate the costs and complexities of developing the property in closing unearthing a

    "the ancients werent just telling storiesthey were mapping the brain every myth of exile and return heaven and earth serpent and sky mirrored the split between our hemispheres and the nervous systems loss of coherence the neurobiological bridge to mythology they were already describing the neurobiological link through symbol long before they had the language for it myth was their way of mapping the body and brain in real time without needing to know what a neuron was as human consciousness developed two forms of intelligence evolved in parallelthe lower circuitry of the body the nervous system reads reality directly through sensation the higher mind maps that reality into symbols and strategies one gives us accuracy in the present moment the other gives us continuity across time theyre meant to operate as a feedback loop when the upper system stops listening to the lower perception fragmentsthought continues but its no longer calibrated to the sensory field that makes it trustworthy as human consciousness developed two forms of intelligence evolved in parallel the lower circuitry of the body our nervous system reads reality directly through sensation temperature tone tension the micromovements of another persons face its ancient fast and precise the higher mind interprets names and plans its gift is abstraction but its danger is distance when the higher mind stops listening to the body thought becomes detached from the sensory field that keeps it honest that detachment is the origin of performance when we lost trust in our own nervous systems our internal capacity to detect safety threat sincerity or deception we built external codes to compensate politeness etiquette professional tone even the standard hello how are you became forms of social sonarthey allow disembodied people to sense each others predictability without having to feel anything the logic is simple if everyone stays inside the same narrow pattern deviation equals dangera person who moves or speaks differently breaks the rhythm the body unconsciously expects in a culture that no longer feels its way through reality difference reads as threat this is why authenticity neurodivergence or raw emotional expression can provoke anxiety in the socially conditioned nervous systemit has lost its internal map without interoception and intuition predictability becomes the only safety check left the more disconnected we are the more scripted we become the more connected we are the more we can tolerate novelty complexity and truth when the body and higher mind reintegrate the nervous system resumes its original function realtime intelligence we can sense the energy of a room without defaulting to performance we can meet difference without collapse or aggression because our sense of safety comes from within not from conformity reembodiment is not regression its evolution in reverse bringing the higher mind back into alliance with the body that made it possible presence is what happens when cognition and sensation stop competing for control and start coregulating again thought becomes informed by feeling intuition becomes precise instead of mystical when that integration occurs scripts fall away naturally the nervous system doesnt need them it can read truth directly the original split as the human mind evolved awareness began to observe itself that selfreflection was both a leap and a fracture instead of being experience we started thinking about experience when early life trauma or the absence of mirroring entered that system the observing mind learned to distrust the raw signals of the body thought became the safer home sensation became territory to control thats the real beginning of dualism not philosophys abstraction but the nervous systems survival strategy the mindbody split isnt just an idea fromdescartes its a physiological adaptation to painthe higher mind built to interpret and plan took command to protect the organism from what it could no longer safely feel over centuries that defensive architecture hardened into culture intellect elevated emotion privatized instinct pathologized reembodiment reverses that historical reflex its not regression into instinct but restoration of dialogue between the two intelligences the bodys truth and the minds meaning when they reenter partnership consciousness becomes whole again the mind as a protective artifact thinking and embodiment are not the same the body is native the mind is constructed our natural consciousness arises through sensation breath pulse temperature rhythmbut the mind we live inside today is a product of adaptation it formed in response to danger confusion and the absence of attuned reflection it learned to speak in symbols because no one mirrored our feelings back to us in their raw form what we call the mind is really an internalized world a structure built from language culture and defense its the running commentary that tells us who we are and how to behave so we can remain safe within our environment when it criticizes judges or catastrophizes it isnt trying to destroy us its trying to control what it doesnt know how to feel this mental voice isnt malicious its an old guardian using the only tools it has prediction rehearsal repetition it replays pain to prevent its recurrence but in doing so it keeps us cycling through the same closed loop of thought cut off from the direct intelligence of the body reembodiment isnt about silencing the mind its about teaching it a new language one grounded in sensory truth rather than inherited fear when the mind learns to listen to the body again its protection becomes guidance instead of constraint the legacy of disconnection the mindbody split didnt just shape our psychology it shaped our historywhen intuition emotion and embodied knowing became suspect society learned to fear what it couldnt categorize the same logic that privileges thought over feeling created the conditions for hysteria diagnoses and later lobotomyliteral attempts to silence the bodys voice when it spoke too loudly people werent just medicated or institutionalized they were made examples of warnings to others about what happens when you fall out of sync with the social script those labeled hysterical or unstable were often the ones still feeling in a culture that had anesthetized itself their punishment reinforced the lesson numbness equals safety that wound is still in the collective nervous system the subtle fear of being too much too emotional or too sensitive is a modern echo of those same survival patternsinternalized oppression disguised as selfcontrol reembodiment then isnt just personal healing its historical repair it restores what was exiled the living intelligence of the body the mythic splitadam and eve the story of adam and eve is not about sin its about separation before the fall there was no split between body and mind no shame no distance between experience and awarenessthey were presence living within the field of direct knowing the moment they ate from the tree of knowledge consciousness turned inward upon itself awareness began to observe instead of simply be thats the loss of the higher mind and the beginning of exile from embodiment knowledge replaced direct sensation selfawareness became selfjudgment you shall be as gods knowing good and evil is not a moral warning but a neurological one the fragmentation of perception it marks the moment the nervous system learned to distrust its own signals the origin of performance shame and control the expulsion from eden is the archetypal trauma the moment consciousness left the garden of the body to live inside the mind every act of reembodiment every return to felt presence is a step back toward that original unity the neurological migration the story of adam and eve is the symbolic record of a neurological event the migration of consciousness from the integrated brain to lefthemisphere dominance before the split awareness functioned more like the right brain holistic sensory relational grounded in direct experience after the fall the left hemisphere analytical categorical languagedriven took control the left brain is brilliant at naming organizing and predicting but it does so by abstracting from life itself it thinks about experience rather than within it thats the same movement as eating from the tree of knowledge trading the immediacy of being for the security of control as trauma and cultural conditioning reinforced this shift rightbrain intuition and bodily awareness were demoted to irrational the nervous system began routing perception through interpretation first sensation second this is the physiological counterpart to exile from eden the moment humanity left the living body and took residence in the map of it reembodiment is the return journey reactivating the rightbrains relational field so it can stand in partnership with the left bringing feeling and thought back into coherence loss of the higher mind the adamandeve moment marks not the awakening of higher consciousness but its collapse into defense when the bodys safety circuits were flooded by fear and shame the neocortexour capacity for integrated awareness went offline what remained was the analytical fragment of mind the lefthemisphere machinery that names separates and predicts in order to survive the real higher mind is not that calculating voice its the full neocorticallimbic partnership that can feel and think at once trauma interrupts that partnership it traps awareness in the midbrain loop of vigilance while the prefrontal cortex is recruited to justify or control the alarm the result is what we call ego cognition in service of survival instead of consciousness in service of truth reembodiment reengages the neocortex through safety and interoception when the nervous system feels secure enough to sense again higher cognition returns not as abstraction but as compassion foresight and creative synthesis birth of the persona architectural revival the split that birthed the higher mind also gave rise to the personathe mask consciousness wore to survive its separation from source it was the first performance a necessary adaptation to the shock of selfawareness over time the mask hardened into identity and the archetypes beneath it fell asleep but as the cycle turns and consciousness descends again into the body those buried archetypes begin to stir reembodiment is their revival isis reassembling osiris the psyche remembering its own wholeness what was once projected outward as gods and myths now reawakens within us as living functions of the soul the journey that began with the birth of persona ends with its transcendence not the loss of self but the return of the sacred through it feminine and masculine symbolism in symbolic terms the left brain embodies the masculine principle structure order precision and control the right brain mirrors the feminineintuition creativity feeling and fluid perception when either dominates imbalance follows rigidity without flow or depth without direction integration is the sacred marriage of the two where logic becomes intuitive and intuition becomes discerning from that union arises sovereignty the state of being guided not by polarity but by coherence body signals and translation errors we still receive signals from the body whats changed is our capacity to interpret them when those internal messages are scrambled or unfamiliar the mind steps in to make sense of the discomfort and as a defense it often assigns blame outward what begins as an unprocessed bodily signal becomes a story about someone else making us feel unsafe this is the egos attempt to preserve coherence when regulation is lostthe result is disconnection the body speaks in sensation the mind answers in projection in polyvagal terms this reflects a dorsal vagal shutdown the nervous system retreating from overwhelm true survival of the fittest has never meant the strongest or most aggressive it means the most adaptable the one most capable of regulation and reconnection reunion of earth and sky the living bridge between body and awareness is realization itself consciousness made flesh its the moment spirit remembers its roots in matter and matter remembers its light that recognition is the true resurrection the return of heaven to earth within us as above so below revelations the latin revelatio from revelare to lift the veil is the truest sense of apocalypse it was never about the end of the world but the unveiling of what was hidden when myth reconnects with the body it becomes revelation not something new but something remembered what was once symbolic turns tangible what was distant becomes lived revelation isnt discovery its recognition the body remembering the story it has always told the truth hidden in plain sight for thats the best place to hide something we spent centuries looking for god out there in heaven in temples in storiesnever realizing that what we sought was the awareness within us now were turning back toward the body the place we left behind these ancient stories begin to make sense when we see how they mirror the processes of the brain and the intelligence of the nervous system the realization itself is the return not ascension but incarnation what was once worshiped in the sky can now be felt in the flesh a reclaiming of the feminine energy to restore wholenessthe sky and the earth the bird and the serpent united again as the dragon and there appeared a great wonder in heaven a woman clothed with the sun and the moon under her feet and upon her head a crown of twelve stars and she being with child cried travailing in birth and pained to be delivered and there appeared another wonder in heaven and behold a great red dragon having seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns upon his heads in esoteric and symbolic traditions the sevenheaded dragon or seven crowns often correspond to layers of consciousness initiatory thresholds or energetic centerswhat later systems like kundalini or theosophy frame as the seven chakras mythical symbolism this pattern of descent and return echoes across traditions dantes climb from inferno to paradise the alchemical solve et coagula isis reassembling osiris inannas descent to the underworld orpheus seeking eurydice christs resurrection the phoenix rising from its ashes the buddhas awakening beneath the bodhi tree the shamans journey of dismemberment and return and the serpent shedding its skin to be reborn each tells the same story in a different language consciousness dissolving remembering and returning to itself transformedthe philosophers described it abstractly hegels dialectic marxs alienation platos ascent toward virtue but mythos somatic makes it lived the split they named was never just intellectual it was physiological an orientation error between mind and body the revelation isnt out there but within us we are the god hidden in plain sight rediscovering wholeness through reembodiment just added the higher mind the ego and the physiological bridge the higher mind is not a structure it is a state of synchronization true awareness arises when both hemispheres of the neocortex and the bodys core systems operate in rhythmthe neocortex itself is divided into two hemispheres connected by the corpus callosum when we are regulated and alert neural oscillations alpha theta gammasynchronize across hemispheres and with deeper brain regions language and logic on the left integrate with imagery and spatial awareness on the right under stress fight flight or freeze communication fragments between hemispheres and between the cortex and limbic system consciousness narrows and the higher mind loses coherence because the body has shifted into survival priority at the center of this system lies the frontal cortex particularly the prefrontal regionthe brains executive hub it governs attention planning moral reasoning empathy and impulse control but its function depends entirely on the state of the nervous system when the body feels safe and parasympathetic balance prevails steady oxygen and blood flow sustain the frontal lobes the prefrontal cortex can then synchronize with sensory emotional and memory networks yielding foresight patience and creative insight in stress states however the amygdala and hypothalamus hijack control stress hormones divert energy away from the cortex to the bodys action systemsthought collapses into threat detection in dorsal vagal shutdown activity drops even further producing the fog and dissociation of freeze physiologically then the higher mind is the frontal cortex in full integration an organismic coherence where both hemispheres and lower centers communicate fluidly safety and regulation are not luxuries they are the preconditions for insight the ego actss as mediator not enemy its allegiance shifts according to the bodys statewhen dysregulated it aligns with the primal survival brain amygdala limbic circuitsbecoming protective controlling and projective it externalizes danger because the system cannot yet feel safe enough to reflect when regulation returns and the prefrontal cortex reengages the ego partners with the higher mind reflection replaces reaction empathy and nuance become possiblethis means the egos choice is not moral but physiological it works with whichever circuit holds the most energy the task of evolution is not to destroy the ego but to regulate the body allowing the ego to collaborate with the higher mind rather than be hijacked by fear the heartprefrontal nexus the directing hub at the junction of these systems lies the heartprefrontal nexus the true directing hub of consciousnessthrough the vagus nerve the heart communicates directly with the brain influencing emotional clarity and intuition when this circuit is coherent heart rhythm and cortical activity synchronize producing the physiological basis for wisdom and compassion when incoherent the same circuitry becomes cunning defensive or manipulative the trickster aspect of mind the hardware is the same frontal cortexheart field vagal feedback the signal depends on regulation coherence turns the trickster into a guide incoherence turns the guide into a saboteur this is why in myth and psychology alike the trickster is not evilhe is the threshold guardian testing whether consciousness is balanced enough to hold power responsibly ra and the solar archetype in egyptian symbolism ra embodies this same dynamic as the solar principle illumination will creative power ra can either nourish or scorch when aligned with the higher center his light sustains life when detached from the heart prefrontal coherence it becomes blinding pride in the myth where isis poisons ra the serpents sting forces descent humbling the solar ego it is a nervoussystem metaphor collapse as initiation surrender as the pathway to integration only through that shock does ra reveal his secret name the hidden self beyond power and performance part two will expand on this idea drawing parallels with several mythic frameworks including the egyptian concept of the ba the narrative of a man and his soul in dialogue i will include the link see if this connects with any other myths you know especially isis think about the wings the bird the ba the theme of reassembly think too about the caucasus the mountain the binding the endless return these symbols echo across traditions each one points to the same mystery of fragmentation and flight we can see the snake andbird motif repeated throughout time and across culturesfrom egypt to mesoamerica dis symbolism reappears in quetzalcoatl the plumed serpent a union of earth and sky instinct and spirit i dont claim to have it all sorted out but i believe the key lies in the relationship between the left brain the right brain and what i call the higher mind the higher mind isnt just one hemisphere or the otherits the synthesis that emerges when both sides are in harmony its the third thing the bridge the awareness that can hold duality without being divided by it we shall not cease from exploration and the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we started and know the place for the first time through the unknown remembered gate when the last of earth left to discover is that which was the beginning at the source of the longest river the voice of the hidden waterfall and the children in the appletree not known because not looked for but heard halfheard in the stillness between two waves of the sea ts eliot from little gidding four quartets gardners books main edition april 30 2001 originally published 1943 consciousness is a pattern not merely an individual experience but a living pulsing structure that emerges across time minds and generations its rhythm resonance interconnection and like any pattern it can be coherentor it can be distorted the wound of humanity whether you approach it through marxs critique of alienation jungs shadow and the split psyche mythological tales of exile and fall trauma theorys dysregulation of the nervous system or theologys concept of sin or separation is fundamentally a disruption disruption in the natural coherence of that pattern its a break in relationship between self and self self and other self and source marx saw the distortion in the economic structure where labor was severed from meaning and people were estranged from their essence jung located it in the psyche where disowned aspects of the self fester in the unconscious and erupt in projection addiction or despair myth tells us over and over of a primordial rupture a fall from grace a tearing of the veil a forgetting of origi trauma science reveals how dysregulated bodies and shattered safety become encoded into the very rhythm of thought breath and behavior and theology calls it sin exile or the aching distance between the divine and the human all of them describe the same phenomenon in different languages a system no longer harmonizing with itself a pattern interrupted a coherence frayed healing then whether political psychological spiritual or relational is not the invention of something new but the retuning of the field corrections coming soon not comprehensive this paper demonstrates the ancients werent just telling storiesthey were mapping the brain every myth of exile and return heaven and earth serpent and sky mirrored the split between our hemispheres and the nervous systems loss of coherence what we call neuroscience is the modern language for an ancient map of consciousness the temples and the texts were always describing the same thing the minds fall from the body and the long return home through reembodiment body mind and the role of the ego the human body operates with a builtin survival system an ancient form of intelligence made up of sensations impulses and reflexes this system doesnt think or analyze it responds in realtime to the environment sensing danger or safety pleasure or discomfort hunger or fullness it evolved to keep us alive not to reflect or ask why when a person lives entirely from this instinctual system their behavior is driven by the bodys immediate needs or fears they eat when hungry withdraw when threatened and seek comfort when anxious these actions are automaticnot chosen not thought through this is where the higher mind comes in the higher mind also known as reflective awareness is what allows us to step back and think it adds context memory foresight and empathy it lets us imagine consequences recognize patterns and consider others perspectives without this higher function we lose the ability to respond with awareness instead we react based on instinct alone the ego plays a critical role between these two systems in psychological terms the ego is the part of the self that mediates between the unconscious drives of the body and the conscious thoughts of the mind it gives structure to experience turning raw emotion into meaning sensation into language and impulses into decisions when healthy the ego integrates both the bodys signals and the minds reasoning allowing us to act with both instinct and insight but when the ego becomes rigid or fragmentedoften due to trauma or early emotional disruption it loses that integrative function either the mind takes over and suppresses the body or the body overwhelms thought many psychological and spiritual traditions describe this integration in a threepart model in christian theology its the trinity the father pure being the son embodiment and the holy spirit connection or flow in hinduism there is brahman the source atman the self and shakti energy or breath these arent just metaphors they reflect a deep psychological truth the body the mind and the ego form a similar triad instinct awareness and the mediator that keeps them in conversation in this structure the ego is not the enemy as often misunderstood its the translator it listens to the bodys signals like tension hunger or emotion and helps the mind make sense of them it also helps the body respond to the minds direction like pausing before acting staying grounded in anxiety or resisting urges when theyre not appropriatethe ego becomes dysfunctional only when its overwhelmed cut off from either side or operating in survival mode when this system breaks down often due to chronic stress trauma or emotional neglect the communication between body and mind becomes distorted the ego no longer reflects it defends instead of translating meaning it reacts with control avoidance or selfjudgment in trauma theory this is often described through polyvagal theory or dissociation the body shuts down the mind disconnects and the self becomes fragmented however when the body and mind reconnect what some call reembodiment or regulationthe ego regains its role the nervous system returns to a state of safety and the bodys signals become readable again thoughts are no longer defensive theyre clear emotions no longer overwhelm they inform this reintegration allows for realtime intelligence the ability to feel and think at the same time it is not regression to instincts but evolution toward coherence symbolically this process is reflected in myths across cultures the divine child archetype seen in horus jesus or vishnu incarnate represents the integration of higher and lower spirit and matter mind and body thought and feeling these stories illustrate the birth of a new self not ruled by instinct nor detached in thought but whole this is the true role of the ego not as a controller but as a bridge that allows both the bodys wisdom and the minds awareness to work together meaning also emerges from this integration in jungian psychology a symbol is not just a word or image its the meeting point of unconscious experience and conscious realization when the body senses something a feeling a tension a resonance and the mind recognizes it and gives it form thats where a symbol is born its not just an idea its something you feel and know at the same time if the body sends a signal and the mind cant process it it turns into discomfort confusion or projection if the mind overanalyzes but ignores the body we become detached anxious or dissociated but when the ego is attuned to both a new kind of clarity emerges the self becomes able to hold paradox instinct and insight sensation and meaning the concrete and the abstract this moment of realization when the bodys felt experience and the minds interpretation meet is what many traditions consider awakening in this sense the son isnt a person but a state of consciousness the birth of awareness that arises when opposites integrate its not the elimination of the ego but its fulfillment the ego becomes the space where the finite and the infinite recognize themselves in each other",

    "what are the psychological benefits of slow coloring what are the psychological benefits of slow coloring slowing down is essential in todays fastmoving technologically driven multitasking world it is here that slow coloring has emerged as an unexpectedly effective tool for ensuring good mental health although coloring was formerly thought of as a childs pastime its adaption to adults has shown a wealth of psychological advantages especially when it comes to more intricate drawings and increased awareness the physics and psychology of slow coloring will be discussed in this article along with the reasons why this straightforward hobby may have a significant impact on the mind emotions and general mental health understanding about slow coloring slow coloring is a deliberate attentive and engaging activity rather than just applying color to forms slow coloring stresses care attention to detail and a strong connection to task itself in contrast to doodling or casual coloring practitioners frequently select coloring books with elaborate patterns including geometric forms mandalas or floral patterns and they utilize a variety of colors that suit their aesthetic tastes and mood it is more about concentration that goes into creating art than it is about creating a flawless sketch this methods ability to lower stress improve focus and promote emotional resilience might be compared to mindfulness practices yoga or meditation 1 stress reduction and relaxation one of the most salient benefits of slow coloring could be reduced stress the process of coloring forces a person to focus on the activity at hand thus acting as a barrier to avoid intrusive thoughts worries or anxieties that is similar to mindfulness meditation where the focus on one point for example breathing helps silence the mind psychologically stress usually manifests as racing thoughts and overactivation of the amygdala which triggers the fightorflight response slow coloring creates a state of flow in which the brain shifts from a stressed to a relaxed state research suggests that coloring intricate patterns can lower cortisol levels commonly referred to as stress hormone thereby calming the nervous system unlike relaxation accomplished by passively watching television or scrolling through social media slow coloring actively engages the mind for both relaxation and cognitive stimulation this dual engagement makes it a potent tool to stress management 2 increased mindfulness and presence being present right now and here without passing judgment or being sidetracked is the practice of mindfulness because slow coloring necessitates careful color selection accurate filling patterns and awareness of how colors interact on the paper it inherently promotes mindfulness by focusing on these microtasks a person practices observing thoughts and sensations without getting tangled up in them in this way one develops the habit of being present which can then spill over into other areas of life such as work relationships and personal decisionmaking according to neuroscientific research mindfulness exercises gradually alter the structure of the brain frequent mindfulness practice will strengthen the prefrontal cortex which is in charge of selfcontrol and executive function this practice can support cognitive advantages including improved concentration patience and emotional stability since the gradual coloring encourages prolonged attention and involvement 3 emotional expression and regulation you may use coloring as a nonverbal way to communicate your feelings coloring gives a person the chance to explore their emotions via color choices and creative expression in contrast to the demands of ordinary discourse which may be impacted by political correctness or the fear of criticism bold reds and blacks may appeal to someone who is angry but blues greens and pastels are more likely to appeal to someone who is calm or satisfied such an expressive activity supports emotional regulation externalization of the internal state through color and pattern processing allows for the handling of complex emotions the release of repressed feelings and insight into ones psychological condition art therapy which very often includes coloring uses this very mechanism to enable clients to cope with depression anxiety and even traumarelated stress the predictable structure of coloring books gives one a sense of control and safety when life seems unpredictable coloring becomes a physical controllable activity whose outcome depends solely on the participants actions this could be a very empowering and psychologically stabilizing sensation 4 cognitive benefits and brain stimulation slow coloring is more than an emotional or meditative practice it also arouses a cognitive activity working with complex patterns involves concentration spatial awareness and fine motor skills by choosing colors and planning how they will be applied the brain exercises problemsolving planning and creative thinking research in cognitive psychology suggests that activities that are both creative and structured such as slow coloring improve attention span working memory and executive function the combination of repetitive motion and creative decisionmaking engages the brain in distinct ways and may support neuroplasticity the brains ability to forge new connections and change over time coloring has also been demonstrated to improve visualmotor abilities and handeye coordination for older folks whose fine motor abilities and cognitive flexibility may gradually deteriorate these are priceless a gentle enjoyable way to preserve and improve these abilities is through slow coloring 5 reduction of anxiety and rumination persistent rumination or the mere contemplation of stressful concepts or hypothetical circumstances is a common cause of anxiety slow coloring provides a secure mental space where user may concentrate on something neutral yet interesting by diverting attention from harmful thinking processes coloring helps the mind to unwind while retaining a certain amount of disciplined attention in contrast to high pressure pursuits or problemsolving hobbies because coloring promotes relaxation and creates a regular controlled setting this combination can help reduce feelings of generalized anxiety it has also been shown that colorings repeated action causes the parasympathetic nervous system to relax which lowers heart rate and eases tense muscles over time this might result in improved coping mechanisms and greater resilience to worry 6 mind body connection and somatic awareness subtle awareness of physical feelings is encouraged by slow coloring people may observe their respiration rate the stability of their pencil hold or tightness in their hands or shoulders when coloring very similar to exercises like yoga or tai chi this concentration promotes a mindbody connection in which awareness of bodily sensations improves general mindfulness and emotional control slow coloring can be a gentle somatic exercise for those who because of stress or trauma or through the sedentary lives of modernity disconnect from their bodies this is a process of regaining ones sense of grounding stability and presence through reconnection with the physical act of coloring 7 creativity without pressure slow coloring has a unique psychological advantage in that it can foster creativity without the need to produce a artistic masterpiece perfectionism or self criticism can hinder traditional art by employing premade drawings slow coloring relieves these constraints and lets participants freely experiment with color shading and texture it provides freedom for divergent thinkinghe ability to generate many solutions or ideaswithout fear of failure the creation process even guided as it is with coloring will increase dopamine production which enhances mood and motivation over time these traits would gradually improve problem solving skills innovative thinking and overall cognitive flexibility 8 building self esteem and achievement completing a page provides the pleasure of closure even though leisurely coloring is more about the process than the final product it can boost ones selfesteem particularly for people who battle with low confidence perfectionism or self doubt besides the process of selecting colors experimenting with patterns and creating aesthetic harmony serves to reinforce decisionmaking and personal agency moreover modest successes and achievements through creativity may reinforce competence and satisfaction thereby contributing to good longterm psychological wellbeing 9 social and community benefits slow coloring can be situated within a social environment even if it is frequently an individual practice interaction and sharing of creations can take place through online forums coloring clubs and seminars while psychological resilience is tied to social connection coloring activities facilitate and strengthen relationships among peers and family members foster empathy and encourage emotional support networks that are instrumental in maintaining mental health 10 therapeutic applications psychologists and therapists have recently used coloring more and more often in their work coloring has been used to reduce stress and anxiety in chronically ill patients help children with adhd or learning differences focus and selfregulate support individuals in trauma with a nonverbal safe outlet for expression use creative engagement in a structured manner to improve mood and reduce depressive symptoms among adults since slow coloring is accessible lowcost and noninvasive it makes for an ideal adjunct to traditional therapy allowing individuals to practice selfcare and mental wellness independently 11 integrating slow coloring into daily life to really gain psychologically from gradual coloring deliberate practice is essential here are some ideal methods for incorporating slow coloring into everyday activities set aside time daily even 15 to 30 minutes a day can provide significant stress reduction and mindfulness benefits create a calm atmosphere choose a quiet comfortable spot with good lighting which allows for maximum focus and relaxation use mindful techniques pay attention to the feeling of the pencil or brush the mixing of colors and the appearance that results from these decisions avoid perfectionism emphasize the process rather than the result to reduce selfcriticism combine with other mindfulness practices pair coloring with deep breathing soothing music or aromatherapy to enhance the calming effect sharing and reflection often sharing finished pages or reflections on what one feels after coloring can deepen emotional self awareness integrating these methods into practice can make slow coloring a resourceful and effective tool in maintaining more mental health and fostering growth 12 neuroscience behind slow coloring psychological benefits of slow coloring are supported by emerging neuroscience research coloring always engages both hemispheres of the brain left hemisphere concerned with logic analysis and structure activated by following patterns shapes and boundaries right hemisphere it deals with creativity imagination and intuition and is triggered by selecting colors blending shades and constructing combinations this slow coloring activates both hemispheres simultaneously promoting balance in the brain strengthening neural connections and increasing cognitive flexibility moreover coloring activates the brains reward pathways finishing a page or achieving an appealing visual effect indeed releases dopamine which can improve mood reinforce positive behavior and further encourage the activity the repetitive rhythmic nature of coloring also reduces sympathetic nervous system activity further promoting relaxation and reducing physiological responses to stress 13 slow coloring as a mindfulness based stress reduction tool mbsr is a wellestablished approach in the psychological field for reducing levels of stress anxiety and depression slow coloring easily fits this model as it incorporates focus repetition and awareness where meditation might be difficult because the mind wanders during practice slow coloring offers something more concrete to center on because it is a tangible activity it makes mindfulness somewhat more approachable particularly for those who find seated meditation or concentration difficult over time gradual coloring can yield similar neural benefits as more formal mindfulness practices including improved attention regulation emotional resilience and always reduced stress 14 limitations and considerations while slow coloring has numerous psychological benefits it is not a cure all solution in fact it works best as a complementary practice rather than a replacement for profesional mental health treatment individuals with severe anxiety depression or trauma should use slow coloring in conjunction with therapy medication or other interventions recommended by a healthcare doctors professional additionally slow coloring may feel frustrating for perfectionists at first it is worth emphasizing that the process is more important than the result and that a person should be patient and not judge oneself 15 conclusion a seemingly straightforward hobby with significant psychological advantages is slow coloring slow coloring improves mental health in a number of ways including relaxation mindfulness emotional expression cognitive stimulation and social interaction people of all ages find it to be a useful tool for social interaction therapeutic purposes or personal relaxation due to its accessibility affordability and adaptability slow coloring is a gentle invitation to slow down connect to the present and nurture the mind via creative expressiona much needed respite in todays world of distraction stress and overstimulation slow coloring is a powerful act of self care that improves emotional resilience cognitive equilibrium and general well being making it more than simply a fun hobby",
    "a sweet life without him looking for free link please a sweet life without him avas storychapter 1 after the divorce i dragged my shattered body to a small southern town i changed my identity got a new phone everything connected to the capital city was severed completely they all believed i was dead killed in the brutal murder case that had rocked the entire military district for three whole years white daisies tributes to my memory never ceased to appear on my grave until one day the glass door of my coffee shop was pushed open and an old acquaintance walked in he stared stunned and asked why i hadnt returned if i was alive didnt i know ethan had been living with crippling guilt over my supposed death almost taking his own life for me ethan walker was my exhusband in the military he had an archrival hed been battling for over twenty years they had made a pact neither could marry their rivalry destined to last until old age but ethan fell in love with me at first sight relentlessly pursued me for years and finally took me as his wife chloe hayes hated him for breaking his promise and unleashed all her rage on me the first time chloe lured me into a minefield i accidentally triggered a landmine and my bones shattered my insides bled i spent ten agonizing days in the icu ethan pulled every single string flying in the most globally renowned specialists to claw me back from deaths door the second time she just dumped me in the middle of a desert and ordered me to walk all the way home ethan frantic aborted his entire drill and dispatched an entire recon company they scoured the landscape for three days and three nights until they finally found me collapsing from dehydration shock in the heart of the mojave it was a twisted dance between them a sick cycle of her harming me and him saving me back and forth until the ninetyninth time chloe somehow got the information from ethan that i had a severe peanut allergy she took ten pounds of peanuts ground them into a fine powder and then forcefed them into my stomach through a feeding tube i went into immediate anaphylactic shock as they rushed me into the er i used what little air i had left to beg ethan pleaded with him to call the police but he just shook his head a helpless resigned gesture sweetheart he murmuredlets just let it go chlo is a gold star dependent and she lacks security she only feels alive when shes fighting with you she didnt know your allergy was that severe she was just messing around she didnt actually mean to kill you please for my sake can we just let this one slide okay in that moment my heart flatlined the next day when i woke up in the base clinic the first thing i did was call general walker i knew hed always considered my family background too common completely unsuitable for his grandson with his brilliant future hed wanted me gone for ages general walker i said my voice terrifyingly calmi agree to divorce ethan a beat of silence hung on the line then general walkers response was immediate and firmits good that youve come to your senses ill have someone send over the divorce papers you just need to sign them ill handle the rest once the divorce is finalized dont ever appear before ethan again not long after i hung up his aide appeared in my hospital room respectfully presenting me with a divorce agreement i signed my name stroke by careful stroke tears blurring my vision as everything related to ethan flooded my mind uncontrolled for three years of our marriage he had been utterly devoted to me anticipating my every need but when it came to chloe he had no boundaries the first time i met her chloe threw my service dog who id raised for six years into a livefire zone she watched it get blown to pieces right in front of me i cried begging ethan to hold her accountable but he just held me sayingavie chlos just a child at heart she means no real harm its okay as long as youre alright after that time and time again ninetynine acts of crueltyhe brushed them all off as if they were nothing now i had finally made up my mind i was ending this relationship with my own two hands my hand trembled as i clutched the pen tears splattered onto the signature line of the divorce papers blooming into a blurry stain taking a shaky breath i painstakingly signed ava winters across the page the aide tucked the papers away giving me a subtle nodmaam i will personally deliver your divorce certificate once its finalized until then please keep this strictly confidential after he left i was left alone in the ward and the silence was suffocating it wasnt long before the door swung open again chloe walked in a black and white wreath clutched in her arms a sickeningly sweet smile stretching across her face my body instantly went rigid and i instinctively scrambled backwardyyou what are you doing here she casually tossed the wreath to the floor her smile sickly sweet yet utterly venomousive come to send you off since that severe allergy didnt manage to kill you i guess i have to do it myself no sooner had the words left her mouth than she lunged onto the bed her hands clamping around my throat squeezing tight i struggled desperately but fresh from gastric lavage i was no match for chloe with her years of training air rapidly depleted from my lungs and my vision swam fading to black just as my consciousness began to flicker a nurse doing her rounds burst into the room letting out a strangled screamcolonel hayes what are you doing get help someone help in the scramble i clawed with my last bit of strength grabbing the nurses handccall the police then everything went black when i next woke i was met with ethans cold face his first words held no trace of concern only a thinly veiled accusation simmering with angerava why did you call the police chlo has already been taken away by internal affairs a sharp knife twisted in my chest and the pain stole my breathshe just tried to strangle me to death you think i shouldnt call the police ethans brow furrowed as if i were the one being irrationalive told you countless times chlo is a gold star dependent shes just a child at heart fundamentally not bad she would never actually want to take your life not really trying to kill me i cut him off sharply three years of pentup fear injustice and fury all erupted she tricked me into a minefield making me step on a bomb she left me stranded in the desert for three days and three nights forcefed me peanut powder knowing i was allergic and just now she tried to choke me to death every single time shes tried to take my life if the nurse hadnt walked in id be dead right now do you understand my raw despair seemed to hit him he moved to embrace me but i shoved him away dont touch me im not backing down this time im going to make sure she faces a general courtmartial ethan fell silent for a moment his gaze hardeningchlo and i grew up together in the quarters shes just been a little spoiled and ill deal with her seriously ill have her confined penalized even discharged from the military if i have to but i will not let her go to prison and ruin her life before i could react the aide behind him stepped forward and handed a document to me sign it and this whole thing goes away we can go back to how things were my gaze fixed on the blinding oversized words waiver of prosecution on the document a sharp ache piercing my chest i shook my head defiance burning in my veinsi wont sign it chlo grew up on the base shes never been through anything like this she wont survive a place like the brig avie just listen to me he pressed the space between his brows as if his patience had finally worn thin i said i wont sign i practically roared my voice raw the next second the guard stepped forward roughly grabbing my arm and wrenching it back a sharp cry tore from my throat excruciating pain ripped through my body as he grabbed my trembling hand forcing me to sign the waiver of prosecution then he pressed my finger into the inkpad and slammed it down onto the paper the entire time ethan stood by watching with cold indifference sweat beaded on my skin from the agony my face stark white i gazed up at the man i had loved for years my voice a frail whisperethan for her youd do this to me a flicker of pain crossed his eyes gone as quickly as it came before he turned to the guardget the military doctor make sure her hand gets the best possible treatment and see that shes well taken care of then he picked up the waiver of prosecution stained with my blood and tears and walked away without a backward glance for the next few days ethan didnt show his face again only sending a few perfunctory messages each day tied up with military exercises cant break free dont be upset when you get out of the hospital ill throw you a party to celebrate does your hand still hurt take good care of yourself but immediately after each message chloes texts would flood in they were all pictures of ethan doting on her feeding her porridge giving her massages even using that precious dagger he never let me touch to peel an apple for her that night my hand hurt so much i couldnt sleep driven by a desperate impulse i found myself calling ethan the phone rang for a long time but no one answered after i hung up chloes message immediately popped up guess what were doing below was a video its very thumbnail radiating an air of sizzling sensuality my hands trembling i tapped to open it in the video chloe was stark naked her face flushed as she writhed on the bed naked she slid out of bed and from behind clung tightly to ethans waist pressing her burning body flush against the stiff back of his military uniform ethan dont go i feel terrible the drug the effects havent worn off yet if you leave ill die please ethans steps abruptly halted he turned back glancing at chloe her eyes glazed over his own filled with torment finally he gritted his teeth disconnected my call then turned scooped chloe up and tossed her back onto the bed his voice hoarse and tight with suppressionlets get this over with the video then plunged into darkness leaving only the suggestive sounds of bodies intertwining and chloes moans a mixture of pleasure and pain i felt like id been plunged into an icy abyss every drop of blood in my body turning to ice i clutched my phone dialing ethans number with a stubborn desperate hope all through the night527 callsethan didnt answer a single one only the next day as the sun climbed high did a cold clipped text finally arriveurgent military duties yesterday a tear slipped down my cheek and a bitter mocking twist of my lips so his urgent military duties really meant being utterly devoted to another woman caring for her in the most intimate way imaginable chapter 2 my birthday fell on the day i was discharged from the hospital ethan himself came to pick me up and he even threw a lavish birthday banquet for me at the military base the banquet hall was grand and opulent and he remained by my side the entire time pinning the distinguished service cross hed received to my chest it drew countless envious gazes but all i felt was that medal pressing against my chest a crushing weight was it guilt driving him or did he truly believe a bit of appeasement would make me forget all my pain midway through the event i felt like i was suffocating so i excused myself to the restroom i had barely rounded the hallway corner when chloe stopped me well well well if it isnt the happiest brigadier generals wife this evening she leaned against the wall arms crossed a mocking sneer plastered across her face i wanted nothing to do with her turning to leave but she quickly stepped forward blocking my path ethan values you so much throwing you a banquet giving you such a valuable military decoration feeling pretty smug about it arent you but last time when you called the police wanting to send me to a general courtmartial didnt he still make you sign that waiver of prosecution to get me off do you know how completely obsessed ethan is with me weve explored every single place and you youre just a pathetic unwanted wretch shamelessly clinging to him like a leech what makes you think you can ever compare to that her words were blunt poisoned blades slowly relentlessly tearing at my already shattered heart my face was ashen all i wanted was to escape but she wasnt finished she lunged seizing my hand her nails digging into my flesh the pain was excruciating you want to play tough fine since you wont learn your lesson ill make sure you never forget this i didnt get to finish you off last time but lets see how lucky you are now no sooner had the words left her mouth than two brawny men in combat uniforms materialized from the corridor shadows they flanked me each seizing an arm and without a single word they began dragging me into the penthouse suite on the top floor i thrashed and fought terror clawing at my throat but my strength was utterly useless against their brute force chloes eyes glittered with pure venom and a twisted sort of triumphava since ethan likes you so much ill just have to completely destroy you lets see if he still wants a brokendown slut after im done a man with a leering repulsive face advanced toward the bed a sickening smirk twisting his lips i thrashed and screamed fighting with every ounce of my being but despair rose like a suffocating tide threatening to drown me chloe even pulled out her phone ready to record every horrifying second just as that vile hand was about to brush my dress a deafening crash split the air as the suite door was violently kicked open ethan burst in a furious lion his presence radiating a terrifying almost violent aura his gaze instantly snapped to me restrained on the bed my clothes disheveled and his eyes flared with pure unadulterated fury with a textbook military takedown he instantly slammed the man whod been reaching for me to the floor the guy didnt even have time to let out a gasp before he was knocked out cold avie he rushed over undoing my restraints and pulled my trembling body tightly into his armsdont be afraid avie im here youre safe now the terror of what id just escaped combined with a tidal wave of crushing humiliation and injustice instantly broke through i collapsed in his arms sobbing uncontrollably he scooped me up into his arms carefully wrapping his jacket around me and turned to leave as he passed chloe he stopped dead his gaze turning to icechloe he snarled his voice a low dangerous rumbleive tolerated your spoiled antics for old times sake but to stoop to such depraved tactics if anything had happened to avie today i wouldve personally seen to it that you were executed under military law chloe stumbled back a step startled by the blatant murderous intent in his eyes then shrieked as if a raw nerve had been hitshoot me dead does our history mean so little compared to your few years with her fine ethan if you want my life ill give it to you now without another word she unexpectedly lunged towards the wideopen french windows before anyone could react she plunged out without a moments hesitation chlo ethans face instantly went white as a sheet he dropped me almost instinctively shooting towards the window like a bolt of lightning i hit the cold hard floor unexpectedly a sharp searing pain shooting through my ankle i struggled to crawl to the window only to see ethan tearing downstairs like a madman cradling a bloodsoaked chloe in his arms and leaping into the military suv the engine roared to life with a savage growl and the suv tore off kicking up a cloud of dust he didnt spare me a single glance not then not ever i slumped to the cold ground staring at the empty space where the car had vanished my chest ached with a boundless coldness a hollow silence finally i limped back alone to that socalled home i hadnt even had a moment to catch my breath when ethan returned he burst through the door grabbing my wrist with a force that threatened to shatter my boneschlos kidneys are damaged she needs a transplant urgently youre the only match in the entire city no i wont donate ethan are you insane why the hell should i save her i shrieked tears streaming down my face desperately trying to yank my arm free from his grip but he held my arm even tighter his gaze a disturbing mix of desperation and pleadingavie please im begging you chlo jumped because of what i said i cant let her die shes so young donating one kidney wont affect you much i swear ill get you the best doctors take care of you compensate you for everything double triple whatever you want just please okay no absolutely not you can kill me but i wont donate a single thing i struggled hysterically but against his overwhelming power it was utterly futile he eventually dragged me into the operating room pinning me to the operating table ethan i hate you i hate you before the anesthetic took hold my screams were the last thing i registered chapter 3 i woke again the next day ethan was by the bedside the moment he saw my eyes flutter open he leaned closer his face etched with guiltavie youre awake im so sorry does your incision hurt what do you want to eat i had them buy your favorite he produced an array of costly tonics and presents but i just stared numbly at the ceiling my gaze hollow later that day when ethan went out to get me some porridge chloe slipped into the hospital room again she sneeredoh look the big hero who just donated a kidney ava youre truly pathetic ethan always says he loves you but no matter how i hurt you he always takes my side in the end and now he even made you donate a kidney to me why are you so clueless why do you insist on clinging to him i just felt sick to my stomach i croakedget out her face instantly contorted she glared at me her eyes full of venomyoure asking for it ava dont blame me with that she stormed out it wasnt long before ethan returned his face dark he burst into the room and practically ripped into meavie why did you bribe a nurse to tamper with chlos iv his question completely blindsided metamper with what chlo said she said you hate me for forcing you to save her so you bribed a nurse to add an allergen to her iv causing her to go into anaphylactic shock and she just barely made it out of the er alive his voice was stern and his accusation brooked no argument all i felt was a bitter icy stab to my heartchloe has hurt me countless times and youve never truly held her accountable yet she frames me once and you come at me questioning me blindly without even bothering to find out the truth ethan in your eyes am i truly that malicious and arent you he challenged his voice coldwho else but you would i didnt i finally snapped the torrent of suppressed emotions from far too long ago finally bursting forth i shot up in bed screaming through my tears ethan im done im absolutely utterly done you always believe her you always side with her my kidney is gone she almost killed me my body is covered in wounds and you what have you ever done for me besides forcing me to apologize forcing me to give up my kidney and pushing me to the brink of death your love makes me sick its absolutely revolting he was visibly shaken by my outburst as he stared at my hysterical face a flicker of doubt and uncertainty crossed his eyes before he could utter a single word the hospital room door swung open chloe stood in the doorway looking utterly frail her voice barely a whisper ethan you promised me she almost killed me this time you said i could have her for three days ethan looked from the frail chloe to my own crumbling form a fierce struggle warred in his eyes but ultimately he spoke to chloe his voice heavy alright but for these three days avies life must not be in danger thats my bottom line dont worry chloe immediately promisedi just want to teach her a lesson i wont take her life i stared at him in disbelief ethan just to placate chloe would willingly hand me over to be tormented ethan you wouldnt dare terror gripped me as i tried to scramble out of bed but he averted his gaze his voice a low heavy murmuravie its just three days just bear with it itll be over soon with a wave of chloes hand two female soldiers in combat fatigues stormed in and mercilessly dragged my weak body off the hospital bed ethan save me no i cant go i sobbed desperately my hand outstretched to him but he merely clenched his fists his eyes squeezed shut rooted to the spot completely unmoved for the next three days chloe held me captive in a remote military compound subjecting me to every imaginable form of torture whipping needle jabs electric shocksshe used every method to violate my body and strip me of my dignity only when i was a bloody mess barely clinging to life did she finally stop having her people dump me back in the emergency room like a piece of trash i had no idea how long id been unconscious when i finally woke again the doctor sighed in reliefyoure finally awake he said his voice tinged with exhaustionwe almost lost you we need to notify your family to come complete the paperwork he handed my phone back to me trembling i opened my phone to find an encrypted message from general walker waiting for methe divorce is finalized remember your promise disappear completely the words stole my breath a raw ache in my chest yet a strange numb relief washed over me the thought of ethans obsessive nature clawed at me my voice raw i dialed general walkers private lineplease i beggedhelp me forge a death certificate use an unclaimed female body from the morgue to stand in for mine if i just vanished ethan would use every military resource at his disposal to find me scouring the world rather than a lifetime of his relentless pursuit its better he believes im dead its the only way to truly end it general walker was silent for a moment finally he concededgo with my people he saidill handle the rest with general walkers help i mustered what little strength i had left slipping out through the hospitals back entrance and straight to the airport meanwhile ethan glanced at his watch the moment the three days were up he immediately ended his military meeting and called chloe his voice laced with urgencythree days are up wheres avie i warned you dont you dare let her die chloes voice sickly sweet dripped with feigned innocenceoh are you that attached to her dont worry ive already sent her back to the hospital if you go now youll be just in time to hear the good news shes been saved ethan immediately sped off just as he reached the operating room door the light went out the doctor removed his mask shaking his head gravelymy deepest condolences brigadier general walker ava was brutalized beyond recognition her injuries too severe multiple organ failure we did everything we could moments later a gurney covered with a white sheet was wheeled out",

your balance might be wrong or unavailable if the wallet is not synced with the network so please wait if this is not a sufficient answer for your case and youre looking for more information please see this answer on stackexchange how do i upgrade my wallet to the newest version this question is beautifully answered on stackexchange why does it take so long to sync the wallet for the first time you have decided to use moneros wallet and run a local node congratulations you have chosen the safest and most secure option for your privacy but unfortunately this has an initial cost the first reason for the slowness is that you will need to download the entire blockchain which is considerably heavy 70 gb and constantly growing there are technologies being implemented in monero to slow this growth however it is inevitable to make this initial download to run a full node consider syncing to a device that has an ssd instead of an hdd as this greatly impacts the speed of synchronization now that the blockchain is on your computer the next time you run the wallet you only need to download new blocks which should take seconds or minutes depending on how often you use the wallet i dont want to download the blockchain how can i skip that the way to skip downloading the blockchain is connecting your wallet to a public remote node you can follow this guide on how to set it up you can find a list of public remote nodes on moneroworld be advised that when using a public remote node you lose some of your privacy a public remote node is able to identify your ip and opens up a range for certain attacks that further diminish your privacy a remote node cant see your balance and it cant spend your xmr how do i restore my wallet from the mnemonic seed or from the keys to restore your

    "stop rushing to define yourself the undefined phase is where true potential resides theres a pervasive myth in our culture that personal growth means constantly having a clear mission statement a perfect label or a fiveyear plan ready to go if youre currently feeling undefinedlike youre floating between identities careers or emotional statesi want you to know something critical you are not failing you are in a powerful state of potential the fear of the blank canvas we often treat the undefined state as a void that must be immediately filled we rush to slap on a new identity eg i must be a fulltime entrepreneur now or i am only defined by my relationship status because ambiguity is uncomfortable but when we define ourselves too soon we are often defining ourselves based on past conditioning or external expectations not on authentic present desires think of the undefined phase as the sacred fertile ground before the seed is planted it is not emptiness it is pure possibility a deep reflection the freedom in being undefined being undefined means you are not yet committed to a box that might be too small for the person you are becoming this is the period where your intuition can speak loudest precisely because the noise of external labels has quieted down or should be quieted down if you are feeling undefined here is your practical guidance for navigating this powerful space 1 practice nonjudgmental observation stop demanding a grand revelation instead observe yourself like a curious scientist what activities give you a subtle spark of energy what conversations drain you instantly what do you secretly want to try even if it makes no logical sense you dont need to commit to these things you just need to notice them your definition will emerge from these authentic data points 2 declare a labeling holiday for the next 7 days prohibit yourself from using definitive labels for your current situation when someone asks what you do instead of saying im unemployed or im just figuring things out try im currently gathering new experiences and exploring what feels authentic this linguistic shift reframes the ambiguity from a state of deficit to a state of purposeful exploration 3 embrace lowstakes experiments to find your definition you must do try small lowstakes activities that require minimal longterm commitment sign up for one pottery class read one book on ancient philosophy or volunteer for an afternoon these are not commitments they are datagathering missions you are testing the atmosphere not building a permanent house the takeaway true selfdefinition is an act of creation not an act of discovery you are not waiting for the universe to hand you a predefined blueprint you are gathering the materials observing the landscape and slowly deliberately designing the person you want to become allow yourself the grace of the undefined and watch what magnificent things begin to take shape",
    "a sweet life without him looking for free link please a sweet life without him avas storychapter 1 after the divorce i dragged my shattered body to a small southern town i changed my identity got a new phone everything connected to the capital city was severed completely they all believed i was dead killed in the brutal murder case that had rocked the entire military district for three whole years white daisies tributes to my memory never ceased to appear on my grave until one day the glass door of my coffee shop was pushed open and an old acquaintance walked in he stared stunned and asked why i hadnt returned if i was alive didnt i know ethan had been living with crippling guilt over my supposed death almost taking his own life for me ethan walker was my exhusband in the military he had an archrival hed been battling for over twenty years they had made a pact neither could marry their rivalry destined to last until old age but ethan fell in love with me at first sight relentlessly pursued me for years and finally took me as his wife chloe hayes hated him for breaking his promise and unleashed all her rage on me the first time chloe lured me into a minefield i accidentally triggered a landmine and my bones shattered my insides bled i spent ten agonizing days in the icu ethan pulled every single string flying in the most globally renowned specialists to claw me back from deaths door the second time she just dumped me in the middle of a desert and ordered me to walk all the way home ethan frantic aborted his entire drill and dispatched an entire recon company they scoured the landscape for three days and three nights until they finally found me collapsing from dehydration shock in the heart of the mojave it was a twisted dance between them a sick cycle of her harming me and him saving me back and forth until the ninetyninth time chloe somehow got the information from ethan that i had a severe peanut allergy she took ten pounds of peanuts ground them into a fine powder and then forcefed them into my stomach through a feeding tube i went into immediate anaphylactic shock as they rushed me into the er i used what little air i had left to beg ethan pleaded with him to call the police but he just shook his head a helpless resigned gesture sweetheart he murmuredlets just let it go chlo is a gold star dependent and she lacks security she only feels alive when shes fighting with you she didnt know your allergy was that severe she was just messing around she didnt actually mean to kill you please for my sake can we just let this one slide okay in that moment my heart flatlined the next day when i woke up in the base clinic the first thing i did was call general walker i knew hed always considered my family background too common completely unsuitable for his grandson with his brilliant future hed wanted me gone for ages general walker i said my voice terrifyingly calmi agree to divorce ethan a beat of silence hung on the line then general walkers response was immediate and firmits good that youve come to your senses ill have someone send over the divorce papers you just need to sign them ill handle the rest once the divorce is finalized dont ever appear before ethan again not long after i hung up his aide appeared in my hospital room respectfully presenting me with a divorce agreement i signed my name stroke by careful stroke tears blurring my vision as everything related to ethan flooded my mind uncontrolled for three years of our marriage he had been utterly devoted to me anticipating my every need but when it came to chloe he had no boundaries the first time i met her chloe threw my service dog who id raised for six years into a livefire zone she watched it get blown to pieces right in front of me i cried begging ethan to hold her accountable but he just held me sayingavie chlos just a child at heart she means no real harm its okay as long as youre alright after that time and time again ninetynine acts of crueltyhe brushed them all off as if they were nothing now i had finally made up my mind i was ending this relationship with my own two hands my hand trembled as i clutched the pen tears splattered onto the signature line of the divorce papers blooming into a blurry stain taking a shaky breath i painstakingly signed ava winters across the page the aide tucked the papers away giving me a subtle nodmaam i will personally deliver your divorce certificate once its finalized until then please keep this strictly confidential after he left i was left alone in the ward and the silence was suffocating it wasnt long before the door swung open again chloe walked in a black and white wreath clutched in her arms a sickeningly sweet smile stretching across her face my body instantly went rigid and i instinctively scrambled backwardyyou what are you doing here she casually tossed the wreath to the floor her smile sickly sweet yet utterly venomousive come to send you off since that severe allergy didnt manage to kill you i guess i have to do it myself no sooner had the words left her mouth than she lunged onto the bed her hands clamping around my throat squeezing tight i struggled desperately but fresh from gastric lavage i was no match for chloe with her years of training air rapidly depleted from my lungs and my vision swam fading to black just as my consciousness began to flicker a nurse doing her rounds burst into the room letting out a strangled screamcolonel hayes what are you doing get help someone help in the scramble i clawed with my last bit of strength grabbing the nurses handccall the police then everything went black when i next woke i was met with ethans cold face his first words held no trace of concern only a thinly veiled accusation simmering with angerava why did you call the police chlo has already been taken away by internal affairs a sharp knife twisted in my chest and the pain stole my breathshe just tried to strangle me to death you think i shouldnt call the police ethans brow furrowed as if i were the one being irrationalive told you countless times chlo is a gold star dependent shes just a child at heart fundamentally not bad she would never actually want to take your life not really trying to kill me i cut him off sharply three years of pentup fear injustice and fury all erupted she tricked me into a minefield making me step on a bomb she left me stranded in the desert for three days and three nights forcefed me peanut powder knowing i was allergic and just now she tried to choke me to death every single time shes tried to take my life if the nurse hadnt walked in id be dead right now do you understand my raw despair seemed to hit him he moved to embrace me but i shoved him away dont touch me im not backing down this time im going to make sure she faces a general courtmartial ethan fell silent for a moment his gaze hardeningchlo and i grew up together in the quarters shes just been a little spoiled and ill deal with her seriously ill have her confined penalized even discharged from the military if i have to but i will not let her go to prison and ruin her life before i could react the aide behind him stepped forward and handed a document to me sign it and this whole thing goes away we can go back to how things were my gaze fixed on the blinding oversized words waiver of prosecution on the document a sharp ache piercing my chest i shook my head defiance burning in my veinsi wont sign it chlo grew up on the base shes never been through anything like this she wont survive a place like the brig avie just listen to me he pressed the space between his brows as if his patience had finally worn thin i said i wont sign i practically roared my voice raw the next second the guard stepped forward roughly grabbing my arm and wrenching it back a sharp cry tore from my throat excruciating pain ripped through my body as he grabbed my trembling hand forcing me to sign the waiver of prosecution then he pressed my finger into the inkpad and slammed it down onto the paper the entire time ethan stood by watching with cold indifference sweat beaded on my skin from the agony my face stark white i gazed up at the man i had loved for years my voice a frail whisperethan for her youd do this to me a flicker of pain crossed his eyes gone as quickly as it came before he turned to the guardget the military doctor make sure her hand gets the best possible treatment and see that shes well taken care of then he picked up the waiver of prosecution stained with my blood and tears and walked away without a backward glance for the next few days ethan didnt show his face again only sending a few perfunctory messages each day tied up with military exercises cant break free dont be upset when you get out of the hospital ill throw you a party to celebrate does your hand still hurt take good care of yourself but immediately after each message chloes texts would flood in they were all pictures of ethan doting on her feeding her porridge giving her massages even using that precious dagger he never let me touch to peel an apple for her that night my hand hurt so much i couldnt sleep driven by a desperate impulse i found myself calling ethan the phone rang for a long time but no one answered after i hung up chloes message immediately popped up guess what were doing below was a video its very thumbnail radiating an air of sizzling sensuality my hands trembling i tapped to open it in the video chloe was stark naked her face flushed as she writhed on the bed naked she slid out of bed and from behind clung tightly to ethans waist pressing her burning body flush against the stiff back of his military uniform ethan dont go i feel terrible the drug the effects havent worn off yet if you leave ill die please ethans steps abruptly halted he turned back glancing at chloe her eyes glazed over his own filled with torment finally he gritted his teeth disconnected my call then turned scooped chloe up and tossed her back onto the bed his voice hoarse and tight with suppressionlets get this over with the video then plunged into darkness leaving only the suggestive sounds of bodies intertwining and chloes moans a mixture of pleasure and pain i felt like id been plunged into an icy abyss every drop of blood in my body turning to ice i clutched my phone dialing ethans number with a stubborn desperate hope all through the night527 callsethan didnt answer a single one only the next day as the sun climbed high did a cold clipped text finally arriveurgent military duties yesterday a tear slipped down my cheek and a bitter mocking twist of my lips so his urgent military duties really meant being utterly devoted to another woman caring for her in the most intimate way imaginable chapter 2 my birthday fell on the day i was discharged from the hospital ethan himself came to pick me up and he even threw a lavish birthday banquet for me at the military base the banquet hall was grand and opulent and he remained by my side the entire time pinning the distinguished service cross hed received to my chest it drew countless envious gazes but all i felt was that medal pressing against my chest a crushing weight was it guilt driving him or did he truly believe a bit of appeasement would make me forget all my pain midway through the event i felt like i was suffocating so i excused myself to the restroom i had barely rounded the hallway corner when chloe stopped me well well well if it isnt the happiest brigadier generals wife this evening she leaned against the wall arms crossed a mocking sneer plastered across her face i wanted nothing to do with her turning to leave but she quickly stepped forward blocking my path ethan values you so much throwing you a banquet giving you such a valuable military decoration feeling pretty smug about it arent you but last time when you called the police wanting to send me to a general courtmartial didnt he still make you sign that waiver of prosecution to get me off do you know how completely obsessed ethan is with me weve explored every single place and you youre just a pathetic unwanted wretch shamelessly clinging to him like a leech what makes you think you can ever compare to that her words were blunt poisoned blades slowly relentlessly tearing at my already shattered heart my face was ashen all i wanted was to escape but she wasnt finished she lunged seizing my hand her nails digging into my flesh the pain was excruciating you want to play tough fine since you wont learn your lesson ill make sure you never forget this i didnt get to finish you off last time but lets see how lucky you are now no sooner had the words left her mouth than two brawny men in combat uniforms materialized from the corridor shadows they flanked me each seizing an arm and without a single word they began dragging me into the penthouse suite on the top floor i thrashed and fought terror clawing at my throat but my strength was utterly useless against their brute force chloes eyes glittered with pure venom and a twisted sort of triumphava since ethan likes you so much ill just have to completely destroy you lets see if he still wants a brokendown slut after im done a man with a leering repulsive face advanced toward the bed a sickening smirk twisting his lips i thrashed and screamed fighting with every ounce of my being but despair rose like a suffocating tide threatening to drown me chloe even pulled out her phone ready to record every horrifying second just as that vile hand was about to brush my dress a deafening crash split the air as the suite door was violently kicked open ethan burst in a furious lion his presence radiating a terrifying almost violent aura his gaze instantly snapped to me restrained on the bed my clothes disheveled and his eyes flared with pure unadulterated fury with a textbook military takedown he instantly slammed the man whod been reaching for me to the floor the guy didnt even have time to let out a gasp before he was knocked out cold avie he rushed over undoing my restraints and pulled my trembling body tightly into his armsdont be afraid avie im here youre safe now the terror of what id just escaped combined with a tidal wave of crushing humiliation and injustice instantly broke through i collapsed in his arms sobbing uncontrollably he scooped me up into his arms carefully wrapping his jacket around me and turned to leave as he passed chloe he stopped dead his gaze turning to icechloe he snarled his voice a low dangerous rumbleive tolerated your spoiled antics for old times sake but to stoop to such depraved tactics if anything had happened to avie today i wouldve personally seen to it that you were executed under military law chloe stumbled back a step startled by the blatant murderous intent in his eyes then shrieked as if a raw nerve had been hitshoot me dead does our history mean so little compared to your few years with her fine ethan if you want my life ill give it to you now without another word she unexpectedly lunged towards the wideopen french windows before anyone could react she plunged out without a moments hesitation chlo ethans face instantly went white as a sheet he dropped me almost instinctively shooting towards the window like a bolt of lightning i hit the cold hard floor unexpectedly a sharp searing pain shooting through my ankle i struggled to crawl to the window only to see ethan tearing downstairs like a madman cradling a bloodsoaked chloe in his arms and leaping into the military suv the engine roared to life with a savage growl and the suv tore off kicking up a cloud of dust he didnt spare me a single glance not then not ever i slumped to the cold ground staring at the empty space where the car had vanished my chest ached with a boundless coldness a hollow silence finally i limped back alone to that socalled home i hadnt even had a moment to catch my breath when ethan returned he burst through the door grabbing my wrist with a force that threatened to shatter my boneschlos kidneys are damaged she needs a transplant urgently youre the only match in the entire city no i wont donate ethan are you insane why the hell should i save her i shrieked tears streaming down my face desperately trying to yank my arm free from his grip but he held my arm even tighter his gaze a disturbing mix of desperation and pleadingavie please im begging you chlo jumped because of what i said i cant let her die shes so young donating one kidney wont affect you much i swear ill get you the best doctors take care of you compensate you for everything double triple whatever you want just please okay no absolutely not you can kill me but i wont donate a single thing i struggled hysterically but against his overwhelming power it was utterly futile he eventually dragged me into the operating room pinning me to the operating table ethan i hate you i hate you before the anesthetic took hold my screams were the last thing i registered chapter 3 i woke again the next day ethan was by the bedside the moment he saw my eyes flutter open he leaned closer his face etched with guiltavie youre awake im so sorry does your incision hurt what do you want to eat i had them buy your favorite he produced an array of costly tonics and presents but i just stared numbly at the ceiling my gaze hollow later that day when ethan went out to get me some porridge chloe slipped into the hospital room again she sneeredoh look the big hero who just donated a kidney ava youre truly pathetic ethan always says he loves you but no matter how i hurt you he always takes my side in the end and now he even made you donate a kidney to me why are you so clueless why do you insist on clinging to him i just felt sick to my stomach i croakedget out her face instantly contorted she glared at me her eyes full of venomyoure asking for it ava dont blame me with that she stormed out it wasnt long before ethan returned his face dark he burst into the room and practically ripped into meavie why did you bribe a nurse to tamper with chlos iv his question completely blindsided metamper with what chlo said she said you hate me for forcing you to save her so you bribed a nurse to add an allergen to her iv causing her to go into anaphylactic shock and she just barely made it out of the er alive his voice was stern and his accusation brooked no argument all i felt was a bitter icy stab to my heartchloe has hurt me countless times and youve never truly held her accountable yet she frames me once and you come at me questioning me blindly without even bothering to find out the truth ethan in your eyes am i truly that malicious and arent you he challenged his voice coldwho else but you would i didnt i finally snapped the torrent of suppressed emotions from far too long ago finally bursting forth i shot up in bed screaming through my tears ethan im done im absolutely utterly done you always believe her you always side with her my kidney is gone she almost killed me my body is covered in wounds and you what have you ever done for me besides forcing me to apologize forcing me to give up my kidney and pushing me to the brink of death your love makes me sick its absolutely revolting he was visibly shaken by my outburst as he stared at my hysterical face a flicker of doubt and uncertainty crossed his eyes before he could utter a single word the hospital room door swung open chloe stood in the doorway looking utterly frail her voice barely a whisper ethan you promised me she almost killed me this time you said i could have her for three days ethan looked from the frail chloe to my own crumbling form a fierce struggle warred in his eyes but ultimately he spoke to chloe his voice heavy alright but for these three days avies life must not be in danger thats my bottom line dont worry chloe immediately promisedi just want to teach her a lesson i wont take her life i stared at him in disbelief ethan just to placate chloe would willingly hand me over to be tormented ethan you wouldnt dare terror gripped me as i tried to scramble out of bed but he averted his gaze his voice a low heavy murmuravie its just three days just bear with it itll be over soon with a wave of chloes hand two female soldiers in combat fatigues stormed in and mercilessly dragged my weak body off the hospital bed ethan save me no i cant go i sobbed desperately my hand outstretched to him but he merely clenched his fists his eyes squeezed shut rooted to the spot completely unmoved for the next three days chloe held me captive in a remote military compound subjecting me to every imaginable form of torture whipping needle jabs electric shocksshe used every method to violate my body and strip me of my dignity only when i was a bloody mess barely clinging to life did she finally stop having her people dump me back in the emergency room like a piece of trash i had no idea how long id been unconscious when i finally woke again the doctor sighed in reliefyoure finally awake he said his voice tinged with exhaustionwe almost lost you we need to notify your family to come complete the paperwork he handed my phone back to me trembling i opened my phone to find an encrypted message from general walker waiting for methe divorce is finalized remember your promise disappear completely the words stole my breath a raw ache in my chest yet a strange numb relief washed over me the thought of ethans obsessive nature clawed at me my voice raw i dialed general walkers private lineplease i beggedhelp me forge a death certificate use an unclaimed female body from the morgue to stand in for mine if i just vanished ethan would use every military resource at his disposal to find me scouring the world rather than a lifetime of his relentless pursuit its better he believes im dead its the only way to truly end it general walker was silent for a moment finally he concededgo with my people he saidill handle the rest with general walkers help i mustered what little strength i had left slipping out through the hospitals back entrance and straight to the airport meanwhile ethan glanced at his watch the moment the three days were up he immediately ended his military meeting and called chloe his voice laced with urgencythree days are up wheres avie i warned you dont you dare let her die chloes voice sickly sweet dripped with feigned innocenceoh are you that attached to her dont worry ive already sent her back to the hospital if you go now youll be just in time to hear the good news shes been saved ethan immediately sped off just as he reached the operating room door the light went out the doctor removed his mask shaking his head gravelymy deepest condolences brigadier general walker ava was brutalized beyond recognition her injuries too severe multiple organ failure we did everything we could moments later a gurney covered with a white sheet was wheeled out",

    "m4a a space odyssey the dream of union a humanity without borders without disputes over resources and land without religious or ethnic conflicts one nation one purpose ah what a sweet dream no thats not what this story is about these disputes still exist there has never been a real overcoming of these petty conflicts that shaped the character of an entire species but now in the universal political arena the human race is ruled by a single government in the past an alliance of countries whose objective was to maintain peace between human beings and all those who were our neighbors but years passed a terrible ideological crisis sparked a civil war that lasted almost a hundred years from the ruins of war a new state emerged a totalitarian militaristic and allpowerful state borders were no longer a problem after all there was only one nation religious disputes were ended by immense galactic fleets but the defeated gods were allowed to continue their worship as long as it did not pose a threat to the state the apparent division between ethnicities no longer existed as everyone was on the same side of course some were more human than others but those are details that can be ignored for now a true leviathan was born but perhaps were going too fast lets start from the beginning shall we in the year 2249 an exploration of mars which by this point had already been colonized for industrial purposes stumbled upon strange corridors carved deep into the planets mountains there they found an ancient artifact that revealed mysteries never before imagined by the wildest human mind human technological development advanced almost two millennia in fifty years thanks to this knowledge but this also revealed our position to the eyes of space one hundred years later first contact occurred a reptilelike species with thick scales as tall as trees and as strong as bears attempted contact due to a series of botched negotiations and dubious preparations a largescale war ensued it didnt last long however because it was at this point that the council intervened a political group of aliens who acted as a general voice for the diverse races of the universe or at least the part they knew this experience proved to us that we were not alone the initial horror was overcome and all that remained was fear for the future even with so many advances the human race was still unable to compete even with the weakest pirate group that roamed space in the search of a easy prey but due to our vulnerability we received a series of aids from council knowledge from all possible areas resources with unique properties for many centuries humanity sought advancement a league of countries had been formed a human representation even tried to seek a place on the council but to say that we were truly united in a common goal was a lie that greatly diminished our history and society eventually existing conflicts gave rise to the aforementioned war and then an emperor with a carbonbased hand began to guide the paths of over two hundred billion human beings technically however it was not an empire or a monarchical system of government but rather a military junta but the problem was that everyone knew that only one man there gave all the real orders and he was given the unofficial title of emperor and here this is where a man was born magnus his past is impossible to speak of with precision some say he was a soldier others say he was a guerrilla fighter others say he isnt even human what matters is that today the man was one of the most wellknown names in the bounty hunter market and he had been hired for a rather special task the man who approached him claimed to be a direct emissary of the emperor seeking the services of the right man for a complicated but discreet job at first magnus refused thinking he was being made a fool of but the man gave him proof that he did indeed work for the state directly under the great black wing of the one who sits on the throne the job was simple seemingly all magnus had to do was capture a target and bring him back alive and the payment would allow him to support all future generations of his family if he had one preparing his weapons and refueling his ship magnus set off toward this target it was months of hunting but he was a patient man what he didnt expect however was that this would be the special odyssey that would forever change his life hey there i hope you enjoyed what you read as youve noticed today im looking for a partner interested in exploring a plot focused on a huge scifi world a space adventure lets get to the details shall we i have years of experience with erp my preference is to write long stories with complex worldbuilding and characters creating something organic dramatic and wellwritten i enjoy exploring different relationships characters social dynamics and so on and of course to balance it all its always essential to include the most addictive and depraved sexual experience any mind can create what can i say i enjoy complex plots as much as i appreciate a good dose of sinful depravity but well get to that for now i want you to know that i like to divide my erps as follows 60 story 40 smut fair enough right regarding the plot at hand as you can see ive defined some worldbuilding concepts but more importantly ive left several things vague for our imagination magnus in a way is one of those he will be a bounty hunter on a secret mission from the state from the leader of the military coalition but about him personally i still have several ideas about who he will be but the basic idea i have is that hes a veteran warrior an older man between 3050 years old in appearance but i will adapt this to the preferences of my potential partner looking for a way out of this dangerous life but he is not a monolithic character stuck in a single point on the contrary magnus is a man of mixed colors with the potential to be the hero or villain of this story depending on how things unfold regarding your character as you can see ive left that quite vague my initial idea is that you are the target magnus is trying to find therefore you could be a soldier spy or scientist who escaped the clutches of the military with information capable of shaking the foundations of the state you could be the leader of a revolutionary movement that is forming or perhaps a journalist who needs to be silenced or maybe you are actually an alien that magnus needs to capture and bring back so that the military can study the creature and take advantage of its strange powers or maybe you dont even want to be the target perhaps a partner who joined magnus on this journey or someone who is actually hunting the bounty hunter to get revenge on him or hey maybe you want to be the gm of this adventure what i mean is that the possibilities are endless and you can be whoever you want one character two three its up to you nothing ive written is set in stone we can always create our own stories create your character however you like choosing the gender and species you find the most interesting well for now id say thats it if youre interested send me a message with your ideas and the like english is not my first language so grammatical mistakes may occur",

well lotsa lore stuff simone weil is the sister of andre weil who founded nicolas bourbaki aka nico the niners simone seems to be very much an influnce in what is a lot of tylers more hopeful philosophies that would also show why the perspective switches to a womans at one point also tyler has some feminine styles of singing that feel very gender expressive in ways that i a genderqueer woman recognize and appreciate cuz like i enjoy when ppl express themselves cuz art lots of religious themes religous trauma lots of study and digging into the mind and body and the spirit he continously has talked to fans and keeps up with ideas that we come up with to further flesh out the story its mostly about hope and survival but it doesnt shy away from the darker parts of the mind to confront it or when it confronts you oh this is just trauma ego fractoring into new instinct externalized i mean that makes sense the idea of demons was practiced on the mentally ill people where the routine or ritual of convincing someone that they are possessed by a demon means that you can use that fractored and broken down ego state to make them do what you want this happened espcially to those whos egos are already seperated isolated heavily masked so gender queer and traumatized people who maybe on the plural or did spectrum the range of performance by the singer is prolly cuz dude splits himself apart to find truth in dividing things down to the chemical makeup of it while looking for god in it religious trauma for ppl who hallucinate and split is like multiplied cuz the way that its all about controlling someones spirit this music is him escaping his mind one that was built with the fears and searches and worries that all feel alienated from what is supposed to represent love run and go feels like the parallel to at the risk of feeling dumb i wonder if every clancy song has a parallel a song that was resurrected from another perspective that would fit with clancy using the ability to seize the dead as a songwriter that makes sense before songs you get poems and pieces of long and heartfelt messages and notes of ideas and stream of conciousness so making a song iss a whole ecyosystem of various ideas and seeing what fits together he probably had a bunch of notes of different ideas around the same time and then drew from them once he developed them into songs he probably better remembers songs as batches as he works on various routines and cycles it could also be like disassocative identity disorder formerly multiple personality disorder where people most often 12 or younger before self identity is solidifiedunified who experience trauma and are undersupported develop basically a separation of selves so one holds the trauma of that space keeping closed off so the rest can function thats simplest form this is a survival tool so its form can take whatever is needed meaning there can be many alters that do not know each other and one that acts as the

look like the way all of this is shot is leaning into that comicbook style with the types of establishing shots its another lense of the universe a question of what if tp was in this style universe with their lore as their story how would that be portrayed here they do that a lot its best to take the simular scenes and overlay them to layer out a reality through many stories all skewed by perspective but they compensate for each other a personal story of the song being about the lead singer tylers grandma passing away its just a musical duo tyler and josh with creative director mark who has been with them for years i mean the band does also work with other artists such as paul meany of mutemath and really comunnicate and grow with their audience learning from fans interpretations to add more meaning to their storytelling selftitled the world as a story laws of angels and demons dreams and nightmares vessel the story of the body and its decay vast unknown and wake til sleep others fears and bodies blurryface the story of masks that portray the shallowness of fame the familiarly and easy social comfort of fear trench joys of the pit deeper truths of self coping hoping fighting skills and realizations scaled and icy lies to force spiral trash the dragon vultures denial caged joy actual joy breaking free inside isolation obscurity masking coldness clancy rage regression honesty haunting old mistakes intuition and practice the rhetoric of antirealism and the copenhagen spirit experimental accuracy operationalism and limits of knowledge 1925 to 1935 i think this version of the scars on his face is a more dramaticcomic book kinda look like the way all of this is shot is leaning into that comicbook style with the types of establishing shots its another lense of the universe a question of what if tp was in this style universe with their lore as their story how would that be portrayed here they do that a lot its best to take the simular scenes and overlay them to layer out a reality through many stories all skewed by perspective but they compensate for each other holding onto you reaction i love getting to hear the technical details like the bright yellow light for white and the blue for the black that reminds me of a lotta of the color theory themes they have running throughout its only in black and white the bishops cant see yellow this reminds me of seizing and the bishops are kinda like older versions of tylers beliefs once they get to the point of like him learning more about the world or growing out of a certain perspective the bishops are like old habits old fears that seize you when you are weaktired when the sun son goes down tyler falls thats a v common motif the lore is a lotta explorations of reinterpreting an idea or finding its inverse in style honesty situation perspective whatever you can think of that really resonates its like those 3d art books where you look at two pictures and stare into the horizon through it to see the planned illusion back to the song you could also think of this as tyler splitting himself in half to only show the hopeful part hope to the point of being nave he does this a lot splitting himself if you do this a lot while you should sleep you can kinda use the dream chemicals in your brain to hallucinate and create basically blackboxes of information that are like a new game save you glitched in or like a notebook you write in the middle of the night and forgot about the next morning it takes a lot of energy to get to this space and more often occurs from intense emotional reactions cuz its kinda a defensive mechanism of escaping from your body so you can portion your energy to where you need it to surviveescape etc people can get stuck there without the proper felt safety and consistency of shelter and food cuz those are survival requirements but like anything its a muscle so you can revisit that its draining tho as someone who had multiple whole rooms not just a box or two being plural is exhausting porting save info or trying to use context clues or set reminders hard when youre six women sharing one womans emotionalmentaletc battery apologizes for the tangent its just so cool that tyler introduces these ideas and themes to more people makes them less lonely 3 stay alive oh yeah like the monotone of it matches with their lore and how they use language routines in the knight like being stoic cuz sometimes when ppl are put under pressure ppl disassociate which i call spocking out cuz i talk like im spock so really embodying traveling the body and mind as the knightnight kinda leaves you dreamy and disassociated pulled out the body but hey thats just a theory and twenty one pilots is all about that the branches of ideas youll find they consistently surprise you 3 in your reaction to overcompensate you mentioned how it felt almost improv which is apt cuz tyler said he spent more time designing the live shows kinda doing what they did with blurryface which is flexing their skills and range and also building out and retracing steps and perspectives from other angles i think they are able to do that so well here because of the skills theyve built up and what is practiced and being learned on this tour how they are building out this world the next album is going to really sink its teeth into the pulse of the world itll take a little bit til they finish it but yeah excited compared to their previous music the lyrics of scaled and icy by twenty one pilots take on a more positive outwardlooking tone focusing on themes of growth resilience and connection this is a departure from their earlier work which often explored darker more introspective themes related to mental health and personal struggles for example their previous album trench was centered around the fictional city of dema a metaphor for tylers struggles with depression and anxiety songs like neon gravestones and my blood explore themes of selfharm and suicide while the hype urges listeners to push past their fears and doubts in their earlier work tyler often used religious and abstract themes as metaphors for his struggles for example the song car radio features the repeated refrain and now i just sit in silence which serves as a metaphor for tylers inability to distract himself from his own thoughts and emotions however even in scaled and icy tyler still uses metaphors to explore his experiences the song choker uses the metaphor of a snake biting its own tail to represent the cyclical nature of anxiety and depression while formidable uses the metaphor of a broken record to describe the feeling of being stuck in a negative cycle in tyler josephs solo work his lyrics often explore more personal themes related to his family and relationships for example the song no phun intended features lyrics about his relationship with his brother while save is a tribute to his wife overall while scaled and icy by twenty one pilots is a departure from their previous work it still contains the same elements of introspection metaphor and personal experience that have defined their music from the beginning trees are the fans yes but trees are the fans who stay quiet the fans who even at his concert are shy hiding away the heathens the deathly ones who live the best they can god to tyler josesph is just the time you spend thinking about the world the time hes overthought the darker part of his mind is where his mind turns because of fear because of doubt because he must believe he was raised in it he stews in it he burns in it jumpsuit all it is him in the air he jumps over his piano he climbs as high as he can wearing the confidence of the crowd outside is literally about outsiders at least as tyler sees them there are two factors either people are taking your vibes into the mainstream or youre on the outside im on the outside in the summer heat you can pay the cover charge im on the street little did they know you cant touch me im vibing vibing he despite having outsider tendencies is famous on stage and people pay to see him not only that hes aware of the people around him people on the street writing and performing shows is tylers drug only smoking second hand aka only enjoying music by listening to other peoples music rather than making it tyler is always listening to music its part of how he fights depression good day tyler loses everything choker tyler chokes feels alone and says its who he was born to be shy away dont you leave me or act cold to me the outside up gooder down badder or am i on the out side i am a megolodon i will fall away die i will diei will take my precious time blurryface is defeated when crowd sings my names blurryface because bf is the fear of nobody caring showing up no one to cosign my fears ill sign on the line alone ill write without people the crowd is the propaganda the togetherness during the pandemic leave the city fire is joys god is true fire bishops have a sterile god that leaves you cold singed my hands trees is are people the crowd maybe maybe in a march to the sea heathens trees all my friends are heathens and i fear silence in the trees car radio is about breaking tylers fear that the crowd would be cold to his performance mulberry street about vaxxersself isolators get out of our way were moving sideways person outside please

apex predator and a villain they are clinging on cogs im stepping on viewing self as bigger and better than everyone else like this is just dema with morning talkshow paint on it like how the truman show was about this happy mans life who was kept in a dome via trama so he doesnt explore too far yeah im a bit sad that he didnt get the albums themes although they are cryptic but basically think the trumanshow wandavision to me the last song was obvious in its themes and tyler talked about them as well so im sad he didnt fully get it fantano has always been a stickler for albums to be approachable self contained stories and sai basically mocks that idea its built off of juxtaposing itself from older albums with very bright thin pop paint that wears away to show a miserable town controlling the people via fear its like a horror movie with creepy singing that was edited by the monsters to seem like a happy movie the live performance definitely supports this and is super rewarding to anyone who digs into the story i dont bother anyone nervous when i stand chokin on the circumstance only smokin secondhand who is the smoker then circumstance cut us open spread us out dry us in the sand lay the fibers side by side and youll begin to understand scientific analysis that destroys the being i know its over i was born a choker nobodys comin for me comin for me like he tried to call out but choked ex dying in an alleyway i know its over i dont bother anyone never make demands chokin on the circumstance selfsabotage is a sweet romance blurry is apart of tyler which hinders him seems like all im worth is what im able to withstand the sooner i can realize that pain is just a middleman the better middleman of what birth and death a person and god tolerance self worth pain is the path i know its over i was born a choker nobodys comin for me i see no volunteers to cosign on my fears world without josh or the fans ill sign on the line alone youre gonna change my circumstance i know i need to move right now cause i know its over i was born a choker nobodys comin for me only smokin secondhand i know its over i was born a choker nobodys comin for me comin for me like a little splinter buried in your skin someone else can carve it out but when youve got the pin it hurts a little less and you can even push it further in pushing down emotions maybe like religious doubt when your bodys screamin out trust your minds listenin like a silhouette that you can barely see your mind watches your bodies pain you look back at a faint shadow as a shadow cast upon the ground where youll eventually lay forever but the day goes on the sun moves behind you you get taller bolder stronger and the rearview only blinds you existence of an ego requires a space for it to exist in that is what the minecraft worlds are for to act as spaces that can be separated from each other the experiments are to see what behaviors are useful for the overseer to have this is so the overseer can maintain the system the physical body using skills acquired from vessels occupied formspersonalities the overseer is using all its ability and energy to 1 communicate with executives 2 organize and plan 3 maintain structure this is draining thats why the overseer relies on executives to do the work even just seeing more of the big picture is draining the vessels are not supposed to be sentient because that costs more energy than the simulation can provide and when they poke around the holes of their reality begin to show the overseer may not have created the system it may have started as a vessel if an overseer scooter ankles it maybe replaced by a vessel altho the executives with their limited understanding may try to take power as they have more understanding than a base vessel the system occurs when basically the multiple sentient players semiegos that have not formed into one being fail to form into one since each tries to grow into a full self the system after a painful decay or a sudden trauma crashes and corrupts this causes there to be a rift between the selves this rift means that information of selves cannot easily cross its like trying to walk through a cobblestone wall but you can chisel a small piece and pass messages through or use dreams as they are spaces older than ego and dont have the same walls the most prevalent or stable self begins to take on the roll of an overseer seeing the limits of the system and starts delegating tasks vessels are created when a new space is entered the overseer or an executive possesses the vessel to perform in that space then the vessel is left in that space as bringing it forward would be like trying to get a body through a wall and that pressure could cause the system to overload if there is no vessel left in a space then the executives and overseers may not be able to revisit that space losing the work put in to visit that space in the first place traveling costs immense energy and the architect itself can get trapped in loops if vessels arent there as placeholders multiple overseers are the semiegos that formed the system before it crashed or possibly replacements if one scooter ankled from being exiled or burning out by trying assume more power or allowing too many of their vessels in their space to become sentient and crashing that area overseers hide things from each other as well as they have different morals that pertain to surviving best in their domain also there is huge parallels to the world of dema and the cycles that clancy faces from the musicians twenty one pilots as well as the bishops that watch over the population who have the power to possess vessels this is probably because its different peoples expressions of simular experiences i wrote my story about shattered minds and multiple timelines and loops and shared dreams a decade ago mine was three scientists were building a machine to explore other realities when it exploded and caused the most simular realities to fuse to the scientists three each with their own conflicting memories and abilities who have to stop one of them from turning evil because the other versions were bad for various reasons a game about leaving the bedroom to get food socialize and work with a dream area too where elements that are normally separated come together in dreamlogic its a metaphor for my did did is like playing a storytelling game where each time there is a loading screen your character profile crashes and reloads with partially randomized stats you have to reallocate points each time clock doesnt stop tho after a while you figure out some builds that work good and can more quickly manually build them out oh and quests get reset unless you set up ingame reminders even if you go to the area you are supposed to the interact button is missing unless you have reminders not all of the quests for me at least just most of them lmao tho thats also random partly depending on if you can keep that quest window on screen too many can cause a crash each profile also only uses a specific section of your mana so running out can also cause a crash causes the need to reload for different mana burning out does mana recovering damage twenty one pilots cholorine as nic the9ers running for my life back when its all complete hide you in my coat pocket where i kept my rebel red i felt i was

mocking clancytyler now that breach has come out it has me revisiting blurryface like imagining tyler as bf singing not today after watching city walls kinda mocking clancy is such a sick visual like every song on blurryface could be imagined as the story of nico solidifying truly coming into being self titled is one that you will want to take notes on the imagery and the physical descriptions it holds a lot of basis that every thing else expands on vessel describes like what it is like being a person in this world blurryface is what its like as the villain mocking the protagonists trench is digging deeper into everything scaled and icy is the false illusions and push towards self destruction clancy is the reanimated version of the protagonist from trench it ties things together breach is half sunset half sunrise in a cycle anything stick out to yall share your connections theories and headcanons id love to hear both arguements for against alongside or spawned from anything i wrote ive enjoyed the lore for a while but did i miss anything in my speculations",
    "complete map of teyvat just like the title says this is my guess at what an ideal complete map of teyvat would look like with geographic continuity between regions i highly doubt that the final map will truly look like this itll assumedly look much more fragmented in this map each preexisting region has an expansion and ill explain my reasoning behind each dornman port for this i just extended the already existing geography northward dornman port should border snezhnaya but i know there is some disagreement on that here there is a west coast and east coast im not sure which the actual port would be situated the expansion ive drawn here is roughly twice as large as chenyu vale which was already quite a large expansion id imagine the actual dornman port expansion to be roughly the same size as the chenyu vale expansion or slightly smaller blackcliff forge for the blackcliff forge expansion i also attempted to expand the geography of the lisha subregion as well as the mountains on its border with sumeru i also attempted to incorporate some of the colours of the chasm to integrate it a little better and if you didnt notice there are actual black cliffs i assume the area got the name somehow im assuming the expansion here will be roughly the same size as chenyu vale as well but if it has extensive underground areas which it is rumoured to then it might only be around half the size above ground ive also drawn it so that its geography naturally leads into inazuma inazuma expansion although we are unlikely to get an inazuma expansion it would be nice to eventually get one and with at least 3 of the preexisting regions set to get expansions why shouldnt inazuma as well this island could very well be the yokai island mentioned in the game i decided to place it to the western side of inazuma just to make the continent feel a bit more contiguous southern sumeru expansion im also pretty doubtful that well ever see an expansion here but a guy can dream the expansion can be roughly split into two sections the western section and the eastern section the eastern section ive imagined to be a new rainforest expansion as we only received desert expansions during sumerus release the eastern section could contain laylas village while at the same time it creates ormos bay the western section is smaller and if released might just be empty land similar to bayda harbour i thought it would be interesting if the desert had a green coast and led into natlans south this geography implies that natlan used to be more connected to the desert but that the land has eroded over time mount esus expansion although it is likely that mount esus will be fully confined to the plateau i think itd be more interesting if the mountain is part of a larger range that connects fontaine to snezhnaya it is also never explained why fontaine is on a plateau the only piece of information i could find is from one of the devs in the first fontaine livestream where he says that it was magically elevated im going to assume that the characters inuniverse dont understand plate tectonics going by the logic of my map snezhnaya could likely be on its own tectonic plate that collided with the plate that the rest of teyvat is situated on this impact could have created the mount esus range and the fontainian plateau similar to how the indian subcontinent collided with the eurasian continent creating the himalayas and the tibetan plateau the himalayas and tibet are also the source for most of south south east and east continental asias water similar to fontaine being the source of all water in teyvat also if the fontainian plateau is surrounded by water on all sides i dont know how salvageable the map will be northern natlan expansion this is another expansion we are likely not to see in the game i honestly have no clue what will be here to my knowledge there are no mentioned locations in natlan that are not currently on the map besides the mare jivari the only reason i added it is to connect natlan with the rest of teyvat because it looked awful without it maybe through some time shenanigans the lost wind tribe of natlan that used to live on the mare javari could live there but that would throw a wrench into the people of muratas and vanessas whole thing in mondstadt so who knows nodkrai expansions the next nodkrai expansion which is notable from its more professional look is from lzrtwt and was posted by usubstantialfan9582 they did an incredible job id imagine that this expansion will be released in 63 the landmass to the north of it is my stab at hyperborea my inspiration was the blue and purple colour palette of hiisi island as well as the dense forests found within the frostmoon scion domain which contained the moon marrow id image the actual hyperborea location to look quite different and probably not as large with the nodkrai expansions likely being vertically north of each other in a straight line im quite concerned with how theyll connect with snezhnaya referencing usubstantialfan9582s 60 satellite map it seems as if though snezhnaya will only connect to hyperborea if even that if these regions are autonomous parts of snezhnaya id prefer if they were at least geographically closer it seems like nasha town will be on the other side of the continent from snezhnayas capital and separated by an ocean snezhnaya we have very limited information about snezhnaya we know there is a railway and we know the names of a few citiestowns most people presume itll be huge but there is no actual evidence on that front i drew snezhnaya to be roughly the size of mondstadt and liyue combined real world russia has a few notable biomesgeographical features such as the great european plain the ural mountains frozen tundra dense forests and many large lakes im assuming that snezhnaya wont be entirely covered in snow and ice and will probably take inspiration from these other features i drew the tundra to be roughly equivalent in size to the sumeru desert and the light brown regions next to the rough forest patches are meant to represent deforestation snezhnaya is a nation that is industrializingindustrialized so environmental degradation in some areas of the country will be likely i also added a red blotch on the northern coast no clue what this could be or what would have caused it i just wanted to make it more visually interesting mare javari i didnt place the mare javari on this map simply because we dont know enough information about it we know its been removed from time but the easybreeze holiday resort is literally growing in its former location so we can also assume it has been removed from space so one option is that the resort just gets destroyed in the future which i find unlikely with the abyss sibling wanting to resurrect khaenriah somewhere in natlan the mare javari is looking like the most prominent candidate but a few more issues arise 1 the mare javari is said to be the home of an ancient destroyed civilization and would be a region with lots of lore would the devs just destroy all of that potential with a copy and pasted khaenriah maybe the exploration of the mare javari could take place during future summer events and then once khaenriah has been pasted it becomes permanent 2 if khaenriah were to be pasted onto the mare javari and become a permanent region would it just be a massive sub map or would it be added to the main map 3 if khaenriah were to be pasted onto the mare javari then it would be a quest locked region somewhat similar to inazuma but on a different scale the amount of prerequisite quests you would need to do would be daunting in the potential scenario where khaenriah is in fact pasted onto the mare javari and the mare javari is added to the main map where would it be it cant be to the west of natlan as the resort is already there that leaves 3 likely locations the first is south of sumeru and west of inazuma this would place the new khaenriah directly south of the old khaenriah and place the former mare javari in the southwest location it is meant to have the second potential location is to the west of nodkrai and north of the resort i dont know why it would be placed here and i really hope it isnt because i dont want the map to expand further west the third location and my preferred would be to the north of mondstadt and west of snezhnaya this would make the most sense from a cultural perspective in the real world the nordic peoples which khaenriah is primarily based on live further north than the other germanic peoples as well as north of the main population centres of russia this location would also balance out the maps northern and southern halves but yeah there is not enough information on the mare javari to give even an educated guess golden apple archipelago i also added this to the map i doubt it will ever actually be added to the game permanently and if it is itll probably be a sub map and not positioned on the main map in the chance that it is though i placed it to be somewhat parallel with the easybreeze holiday resort",

    "a day inside the ashram what its really like introduction some experiences cant be photographed they have to be felt visiting sri aurobindo ashram in pondicherry is one of them while white town hums with cafs and chatter the ashram sits quietly at its heart calm timeless and completely detached from the outside noise it isnt a tourist attraction in the usual sense its a space of discipline silence and selfdiscovery if youve ever wondered what really happens inside heres what a day in the ashram feels like unhurried sacred and profoundly human content 1 the first glimpse entering a world of silence 2 morning meditation the samadhi 3 the daily routine simplicity as a practice 4 the ashram community people who live the philosophy 5 food discipline and the meaning of quiet 6 the evening walk peace in motion 7 how to visit the ashram timings guidelines 8 conclusion what you take home from the silence 1 the first glimpse entering a world of silence spiritual retreat in white town pondicherry the entrance is unassuming no towering gates or grand statues just a grey stone archway wrapped in bougainvillea leading to stillness as you step in your senses change gears the chatter fades the air cools and your heartbeat slows down youre greeted by volunteers dressed in white guiding you toward the samadhi courtyard the spiritual nucleus of the ashram where sri aurobindo and the mother rest together shoes come off cameras stay outside and silence becomes the only acceptable language tip the best time to visit is between 8 am10 am when the courtyard is quiet and the morning light falls softly through the frangipani trees 2 morning meditation the samadhi a still point in the heart of pondicherry the samadhi is a simple marble shrine surrounded by flowers always adorned with fresh white pink and orange petals people sit crosslegged around it some with eyes closed others just breathing slowly no rituals no chants no priests just pure shared silence the stillness here feels alive as if the air itself remembers every thought every prayer ever spoken in it if you stay long enough youll hear nothing but the soft rustle of leaves and the occasional bird call the kind of silence that speaks back to you 3 the daily routine simplicity as a practice how the ashram lives hour by hour inside the ashram life follows rhythm not rules but flow residents known as sadhaks begin their day before sunrise with meditation then move on to simple work gardening teaching cooking cleaning theres a library a handmade paper unit a small art gallery and even a printing press all run as part of the ashrams philosophy of work as yoga theres no concept of salary or ownership here everyone contributes and in return everyone receives what they need fun fact the ashram prints all of its literature inhouse including the famous aurobindo the mother writings that attract scholars worldwide 4 the ashram community people who live the philosophy an international family rooted in stillness walk through the ashram alleys and youll meet people from every corner of the world french artists tamil teachers retired scientists travelers who came for a week and stayed for a lifetime each person carries a story of arrival some came searching for peace others for meaning many never left their days revolve around service reading yoga and maintaining the ashrams serenity proof that spirituality isnt about isolation its about integration 5 food discipline and the meaning of quiet the ashram dining hall where silence becomes nourishment one of the most humbling experiences is the ashram dining hall no restaurant buzz no clinking plates just rows of people eating quietly mindfully meals are simple rice dal vegetables and sometimes fruit visitors can preregister for lunch passes at the reception its not fancy but its real food grown on ashram farms and served by volunteers pro tip if you get a chance to volunteer in the kitchen or serve food take it its where you understand what karma yoga the yoga of work truly means 6 the evening walk peace in motion how the ashram winds down with the sun evenings are for walking residents stroll along goubert avenue or the ashram compound walls talking softly often reciting poetry or quietly reflecting on the day sometimes youll hear faint devotional music or the rhythmic sound of ocean waves blending with the rustle of palm leaves theres no rush no destination just being 7 how to visit the ashram timings guidelines plan your visit respectfully location rue de la marine white town pondicherry timings 8 am 12 pm 2 pm 6 pm daily rules maintain silence at all times photography and videography are strictly prohibited dress modestly preferably whites or pastels no mobile use inside the premises entry is free but guided by volunteers nearby spots the ashram bookstore aurobindo handmade paper factory and the auroville visitors center for deeper exploration 8 conclusion what you take home from the silence leaving the ashram feels different the noise of the city returns but it doesnt sound the same anymore you begin to realize that spirituality isnt about escaping the world its about seeing it differently inside the ashram time stands still long enough for you to hear your own thoughts again and maybe thats the real gift pondicherry offers not just beaches or food but the space to breathe pause and simply

    "popularity hekate vs santa muerte vs maria lionza hecate is also very popular in western witchcraft but not to the general public however maria lionza and santa muerte have popular acceptance outside of people who do magick yes your sensing is precisely accurate and youre hitting on a key distinction in how deity figures operate across social layers lets define the contrast clearly hekate esoterically popular santa muerte and mara lionza culturally and publicly integrated they are not just spirits with cult followings they are embedded presences with public devotion far beyond magical or occult communities clean distinction magical popularity vs cultural presence typehekatesanta muerte mara lionza primary basewitches pagans occultistseveryday people poor workingclass spiritual but not magical main practice spacesaltars grimoires covens social media witchcraftshrines homes roadsides mountains hospitals prisons integration with daily lifeniche spiritual identityfully normalized treated like a saint protector healer general public awarenesslow outside witchcrafthigh even among nonmagical people religious systemancient reconstructed or adoptedfolkdevotional spiritist public why santa muerte mara lionza are different 1 theyre spirits of necessity not just spirituality santa muerte is called when a child is sick someone is in prison a loved one disappears someone needs protection fast mara lionza is invoked for healing fertility justice help from spirits of the dead these spirits are accessible nonjudgmental and effective which makes them appealing across class education and religious boundaries no initiation no training no books required just light the candle speak the truth and leave the offering 2 they are embedded in national identity and collective folklore mara lionza is literally sculpted into venezuelan public monuments featured in newspapers tv specials and seen as a national symbol santa muerte has roadside shrines graffiti murals statues in markets and entire neighborhoods in mexico that claim her as matron compare this to hekate who has been revived through books and magical orders is referenced heavily in witchcraft circles especially online but has no modern public cult outside spiritual niches 3 they are not othered as witches no one in santa muertes cult needs to identify as a brujao many devotees are devout catholics nonmagical people or folk practitioners they dont identify with the witchcraft movement but still use ritual work with spirits make offerings receive visions and miracles compare that to hekate most of her modern invocations are through witchcraft paganism or ceremonial magic shes often linked with magic necromancy the occult this limits her public embrace shes archetypally powerful but socially distant your core insight you said i sense mara lionza and santa muerte have popular acceptance outside of people who do magick yes and heres why they are spirits of function embodied culture and workingclass spiritual immediacy they fill realworld needs not just spiritual exploration hekate is a goddess of depth she takes years to unfold santa muerte and mara lionza are spirits of impact they respond today thats why they appear in shrines at truck stops prayers in prison houses of mourning politicians hidden devotions urban graffiti and rural rituals alike theyve crossed the line from esoteric spirit to public matron something very few deities achieve 2nd query begins here this is a very sharp and layered question and yes youre sensing something real if latin america is so deeply catholic why are santa muerte and mara lionzawho are not canonized not churchsanctionedrising to such prominence have saints and angels failed or has something shifted in their presence lets break this down into occult mechanics socioreligious momentum and fieldlevel spirit theory because this isnt just about faith its about access efficacy and energetic availability 1 yes latin america is still heavily catholic on paper but in practice folk catholicism dominates people blend catholic figures with indigenous african and spiritist frameworks devotion and functionality matter more than doctrine the lines between saint spirit and deity have become fluid and experimental in most of latin america especially among the working class catholicism is not exclusive its a ritual language that coexists with spiritism brujera curanderismo and folk magic people still pray the rosary go to mass call on saint michael and the virgin but they also light candles to santa muerte for protection petition mara lionza for fertility or healing call on pomba gira exu or the lwa depending on lineage and need 2 why saints and angels feel less effective now youre not wrong many practitioners in latin america especially those in danger grief or spiritual crisis report feeling abandoned by saints or angels or say that their petitions go unanswered why some fieldlevel reasons 1 saints are embedded in moral filters many saints are invoked through the churchs moral lens piety confession obedience devotees often feel not good enough or unworthy to ask saints dont respond well to vengeance requests survival through crime spiritual gray zones this makes them unavailable to those living outside moral systems even if those people are spiritually sincere 2 angels are increasingly abstract for many angels feel distant vague or overly aestheticized angelic invocations have been coopted by new age dilution christian colonial purity coding result people say they pray to angels and feel nothing santa muerte in contrast shows up fast clearly and without judgment 3 santa muerte and mara lionza fill the functionality gap they dont ask if youre baptized if youve confessed if your

    "tallah book 4 chapter 51 first royal road patreon anna wasnt quite certain of how christina planned on doing what she claimed then again the finer points of soul magic were still a mystery to anna if her colleague claimed contact could be initiated without grafting the boy onto them then it could probably be done in her words if the priestesses of the dryad can accomplish this we should be able to do it better whatever that meant if anything the strangest part lay in how simple it all sounded when presented they would contact the boys spirit by reaching through the electric maelstrom of his mind something that should not be possible yet somehow was if this works then it shows the lie in most of what weve ever been taught at hoarfrost the soul was the mirror in which the flesh reflected that was the core ideology at the centre of spiritual research what christina was about to prove was that the two were not quite separated one could reach out and touch the mirror it seemed that would explain how they remained coherent their minds and for bianca at least some of their afflictions had survived unmolested after death and soul capture anna had wondered intensely at this and most explanations had not satisfied her it made no sense for their souls to hold on to the knowledge of their lives what was it ingrained on illum held power yes and they were constructs of illum but how did they retain memories scars preferences and even ills anna understood how the mind resided in the flesh she did not understand how it resided in the soul you plumb such depths cytra she said as she readied her strength for what was to come how long have you spent studying this to reach your insight they were sitting on the slope of tallahs mountain watching the rolling storm sweeping across the scenery their hosts mind was cooling bathed in a mixture of feelgoods that were washing away the fatigue of their desperate escape anna welcomed the imaginary rain besides her christina sighed in pleasure before answering arent we all slaves to our obsessions i have very good reasons for learning what i did outside tallah was finishing her conversation with the boy and getting him ready for what was to happen they couldve done this at any other time but now was better than later the decimation theyd caused when fleeing the cauldron together with the dragons attack had likely bought them a few bells of peace anna felt far from rejuvenated after the short rest theyd been afforded so she welcomed the small distraction it would take days for her store of illum to get back to where it had been prior to the fight an ache sat in her core as if shed spread herself too far and too wide almost to a point of fissure had christina experienced something similar after that first hybrid casting it wasnt unpleasant but there was a change happening within something she hadnt felt since her first bleeding and her first illum contact bianca accused the same and theyd decided on exploring the change together when time permitted and they were more recovered anna wasnt certain of the wisdom of what they were about to do neither she nor christina nor tallah herself were at their peak capacity and they had no idea of what waited inside the boys mindscape how much power would christina need to expend for contact alone or what would happen if the thing in the boy fought back what of the dwarf and that ones strange presence never took you for a worrier christina said its wafting off you i feel were going on a fools journey she said not deigning to hide her concerns we dont know enough of what were about to attempt and i worry of what it might cost us it may cost us our lives christina said then grinned when anna answered with a black glare oh dont be so serious you look like the hen when you pout that is not the insult you would think it is anna retorted silestra was far from a chore on the eye scars and all what follows explain it to me christina allowed her manifestation to shift for a heartbeat into the shape of lightning like a crude outline of herself she regained coherence nearly immediately but winced as if hurt ah this will be a pain she complained i will process us into illum so our intrusion will be less apparent then i will rely on you to achieve blood contact tallahs to vergils you know how much power theres in the blood enough that i dont need to explain it from there i will attempt to coax our way into the boys mindscape if we can manage this we will have achieved something quite unique in our day and age what only the dryad manages but not unique in the days of grefes dwellers was the unsaid part anna understood while this wasnt something tallah and christina had found in the books their imagination was piqued since the whole railgun experiment now they wanted to see how much farther they could push their appliance of illum a bit too far a bit too fast in annas opinion but she held her tongue at least the subject was interesting for her so the whole endeavour wouldnt be a complete waste of their time even if it didnt work and once we make contact as you say what then she asked we will have a look at the entity in the boy if its tied to his soul then it will have some reflection in the mind else the dwarf wouldnt have managed to subdue it annas nose scrunched up at that there we a lot of assumptions in that statement christinas confidence bordered on foolishness rather than any kind of sane scholarly proof all they knew of the dwarf was that it had taken residence in the boys chip and from there had managed to oust the other invader it could just as well be a parasite that would spread to tallah using the two of them as a vector diseases could find wonderful ways of crossing what were once considered impregnable barriers such as jumping species entirely parasites were even more adaptable and here they were willingly touching blood with what could very well be some unknown alien form of rabies i think you dont worry enough of what were about to do anna said with a sigh but i know better than to try and stop this foolishness what you mean to say christina said with an evil twist to her grin is that youre too curious of this working to put up any real objection im sure you have several anna sniffed and did not dignify this with a reply instead she checked her store of illum and was satisfied with her recovery if she were yanked out of contact by some emergency she could respond with deadly force within the heartbeat it would have to be sufficient christina flashed several more times between her physical and energy states settling ultimately on an inbetween right then lets see what we can manage tallah and vergil were sat opposite one another on the hill theyd both eaten some rations at silestras insistence drank water and now waited tallah had cut a gash across her palm and the boys and they now held each others hand the blood in full contact anna reached out and tasted the boys on instinct proving there was nothing new or inherently wrong with him then christina pushed and anna found herself dragged away from tallah swept up in the thumpthump torrent of blood from tallahs slow heartbeat to the boys rabbitlike one she focused on drawing together the two life essences to allow for passage christina held on to her as they both crossed the threshold the transition was almost immediate well this was unexpected christina said as their perspective lurched and they dropped in a wholly new mindscape kinda makes you wish youd imagined yourself wearing some boots right they were in a dark narrow corridor lit from above by some kind of light strips embedded in the ceiling the floor underfoot was a metal grate cold to the touch rough and oddly sticky as anna took the first steps in this new space the whole place was unpleasantly cold the chill permeating the air and it buzzed the sound a low drone that seemed to emanate from the lights above well i would call this a cautious success christina said she still maintained her outlined shape cycling power constantly we are connected such a storm this ones mind is i wish i could show it to you oh i wish i could read it anna felt no ill effect from the sudden shift her power hadnt been demanded and she maintained the connection easily between the two she held tight to a tendril of tallahs blood fashioning it as a lifeline to follow back if need be now where do we find the boy without waiting for christinas answer anna took off down the corridor bare feet slapping against the cold floor she shut herself off from stimuli unsure if it would be wise to allow her mindscape to interact quite so closely with the boys that seems as good a direction as any christina floated next to her having apparently reached the same conclusion she let out a soft white glow and showed the metal corridor in all its dreary detail not that there was much to see aside from grey walls snaking tubes and vines and neglect a dungeon wouldve been just as cheerful by comparison tallahs mindscape is quite lovely she commented as the tunnel turned an open door shone a square of light ahead a glimpse inside revealed a space barely larger than a privy it was the same length as the cot that occupied one of the walls with what looked like some kind of washing space nestled at the far end between cot and the other wall there was barely any space at all enough for someone to pass sideways towards the wash basin the detritus of someone living in the cell littered the space discarded food on a metal platter some bunched clothes wet stains on the walls plenty to suggest someone living in there but not living well christina let out a soft coo of affection as she took in the sight if this is how he perceived his living conditions from before then its little wonder he was so happy with his bed at the meadow ive no idea what youre talking about but ive kept subjects in larger cages than this anna said she made a mental note to show a modicum of kindness to the boy in the future if the opportunity presented itself she expected this wouldnt be the worst thing theyd learn of him this seems silly she said looking down the corridor at upcoming intersections are we searching for him in his own head or is this some protection to waste our time we are guests anna well intruders if youd like to be technical he knows where everything is we dont its why we sometimes have trouble finding tallah in her own mind while we share it we will need to find our way to his central mindscape and work our way out from there she rubbed her hands the motion sending sparks grounding into the tunnel walls oh this is so much fun it took them what felt like an entire day searching the labyrinthine maze of corridors and rooms each sight that met them was all the stranger for how ordinary it seemed a room was full of plants grown in glass cages maintained by unknowable machinery that breathed and hissed and clanged another was a kind of hospital pristine filled with shining metal instruments arrayed on neat trays anna cooed over the display reaching to pick up some of the scalpels christina swatted her hand away dont touch anything before we find the boy else what anna demanded i have no idea want to test and see christina grinned ear to ear studying a kind of crystal window on a wall it was showing what looked like bones within an arm in black and white ive never done this before it feels alien but also familiar its like diving into the trap dont you feel anna stared forlorn at the surgical instruments then walked away it does a little yes but not like the trap itself but the surrounding area where its already done its work and that set her teeth on edge",
