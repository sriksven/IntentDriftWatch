    "redwood materials 35b expansion positions us as critical minerals powerhouse michael c anderson editorinchief the opening of redwood materials 35 billion south carolina facility marks a pivotal moment for americas critical minerals independence as the battery recycling pioneer led by tesla cofounder jb straubel positions itself as the nations primary domestic source of essential battery materials today redwood is on par with the largest us source of nickel and stands as the only domestic source of cobalt at scale the company announced in a news release marking the facilitys launch our operations also represent one of the most significant and only new domestic sources of lithium and copper to come online in decades with its new south carolina facility now adding an initial 20000 metric tons of annual materials production to complement nevada operations that produced more than 60000 metric tons of materials last year redwood has established itself as one of the nations most important sources of critical minerals mined or recycled the company claims the china challenge redwoods expansion comes at a critical juncture as the united states grapples with overwhelming chinese dominance in critical minerals processing china currently controls approximately 60 of global lithium processing 80 of cobalt refining and over 90 of batterygrade graphite production according to industry analysis from benchmark mineral intelligence cited by the washington post this concentration has created strategic vulnerabilities that recent geopolitical tensions have brought into sharp focus the implications extend beyond raw materials china processes roughly 75 of the worlds lithiumion battery cells and dominates the manufacturing of key battery components for american automakers and energy companies this dependence represents both a supply chain risk and a competitive disadvantage particularly as the inflation reduction act increasingly requires domestic content for tax credits and federal procurement recent supply chain disruptions have underscored these vulnerabilities when china restricted rare earth exports in previous trade disputes it demonstrated how quickly mineral dependencies can become geopolitical leverage the biden administrations focus on friendshoring critical supply chains reflects growing recognition that mineral security equals national security in an electrified economy this isnt just an economic issue its a matter of national security redwood emphasized the same critical minerals that power batteries also underpin the technologies that keep the nation running and secure nickel and cobalt are also essential for aerospace and defense alloys while copper forms the backbone of industrial wiring and power transmission breaking the mining dependency the significance of redwoods expansion extends far beyond simple recycling capacity as global demand for rechargeable batteries grows recycling plants like redwoods nevada facility represent a fundamental shift away from traditional mining operations known for poor worker conditions environmental pollution and geopolitical tensions redwoods strategy recognizes that the us already holds a tremendous stockpile of lithium cobalt nickel copper and manganese locked inside the products we use every day the company stated within the us fleet of five million electric vehicles alone lies an estimated 225 million metric tons of these materialsresources we can unlock first through reuse in stationary storage systems and later through recovery of the underlying minerals the environmental advantages are substantial according to independent analysis from researchers at stanford university the city university of hong kong and kenyon college cited by the washington post redwoods battery recycling process reduces carbon emissions by 58 percent and water consumption by 72 percent compared with conventional mining once extracted from the earth these critical minerals can be reused indefinitely creating the potential for a circular economy where new batteries are made almost entirely from recycled materials strategic pivot amid market changes redwoods expansion comes at a time of significant market transformation originally founded to serve the electric vehicle battery supply chain the company has broadened its strategy as it navigates expected slowdowns in ev demand while simultaneously addressing supply chain security concerns that have made domestic sourcing increasingly valuable the bulk of the critical minerals the company produces are going to customers outside the ev sector straubel told bloomberg news explaining that the nickel and cobalt markets are largely not driven by batteries this diversification has proven prescient amid growing wariness of chinese supply chains nickel has uses in stainless steel and specialty alloys while cobalt serves highperformance applications including jet enginessectors where supply chain security carries national security implications according to bloomberg redwood now sells its critical minerals to approximately 20 to 30 companies including large industrial customers and mining companies that process and refine the materials 1st use evs 2nd use ess perhaps most innovative is redwoods expansion into energy storage through its redwood energy division which converts degraded ev batteries into gridscale energy storage systems this approach recognizes that ev batteries retain significant value even after automotive applications end the companys partnership with general motors exemplifies this strategy their collaboration enables deployment of both secondlife gm ev packs and new usbuilt batteries in energy storage systems addressing surging electricity demand as ai data centers are expected to increase their share of national electricity usage from 44 in 2023 to 12 by 2028 according to forbes data the partnership is already operational with gms secondlife electric vehicle batteries powering what the companies describe as the largest secondlife battery development in the world and the largest microgrid in north america through a 12mw63mwh installation at redwoods nevada facility as battery technology reported in july advanced recycling technology redwoods technical approach demonstrates sophisticated materials recovery capabilities that could help level the playing field with chinese operations at their nevada facility batteries undergo thermal processing where electric heating coils warm the air to several hundred degreeshot enough to eliminate all plastic glue and electrolytes in the batteries leaving behind black mass containing valuable minerals the subsequent refining process uses magnets sieves and jets of air to separate steel copper and aluminum before chemical processing extracts lithium nickel and cobalt with 95 efficiency the company currently processes materials equivalent to 300000 ev batteries annually the washington post noted closing the loop on domestic production redwoods ultimate goal involves creating a fully domestic battery materials supply chain that could challenge chinese dominance according to the washington post the company is expanding beyond mineral recovery to produce cathode active materials which would allow it to sell directly to us battery makers rather than exporting materials to asia for further processing this vertical integration mirrors chinas successful approach where recycling hubs feature nearby factories that break down batteries into black mass extract key minerals refine them into highquality battery materials and then assemble new batteries beatrice browning of benchmark mineral intelligence told the washington post the difference lies in scale and government support while china has built this infrastructure with massive state backing over two decades american companies like redwood are attempting to compress that timeline while competing against established chinese operations that benefit from lower labor costs and integrated supply chains industry implications redwood materials expansion represents more than corporate growthit signals a fundamental shift toward domestic critical minerals security in an era of great power competition as the company scales operations across multiple facilities while diversifying beyond traditional ev applications its creating the infrastructure foundation for americas battery industry independence the convergence of recycling technology secondlife applications and domestic manufacturing capabilities positions redwood at the center of multiple highgrowth markets from gridscale energy storage to ai data center power solutions for the battery industry this represents both a supply chain solution and a sustainability breakthrough that could reshape how critical minerals flow through the american economy",

    "scrapping green subsidies is shorttermist sabotage and as usual the consumer will pay camilla born after years of painfully high energy bills diminishing household budgets and stalled investment this years budget on 26 november should be the moment when the government finally starts to confront why the uks energy system is so expensive and yet if recent briefings suggesting that labour will dramatically scale back the heat pump subsidy for households are to be believed it is now repeating exactly the same mistakes as its predecessors people want relief from painful energy bills in the long term electrification is the only way to provide this in practice that means switching from gas boilers to heat pumps shifting from petrol cars to electric vehicles boosting access to technologies that are modern cheaper to run and are already becoming mainstream at present our energy system protects the legacy gasbased system subsidising supply and penalising demand in ways that keep gas artificially cheap and electricity artificially expensive even when electric technologies cost less to operate",

    "nightmare engine swap long post ahead id like to thank everyone who post ive found so much info on here and this is my first time posting so ive recently picked up my first 4runner and im now struggling to figure out what my issue is with my project truck 2001 4runner 2wd sr5 35 5vz 214000 miles i picked this 4runner up for 500 bucks i purchased it under the impression that it had bad head gaskets and i was willing to take the risk and i figured i could have a good beater vehicle for pretty cheap with a little bit of work when i purchased it it would crank run and drive but obviously had issues it drove around the block and into my garage before i got to work after further investigation i found that it had zero compression in cylinder 4 once i pulled off the driver side cylinder head i found that the rings in cylinder 4 were toast and the cylinder wall was severely damaged after finding this out i decided i would pull a motor from the junkyard replace the head gaskets timing belt and water pump while everything was accessible on the engine stand and swap it in my donor motor was from a 2002 tundra 234000 miles i looked everything over before i pulled it the motor turned over freely oil looked great i could tell it the valve cover gaskets were replaced and the truck was used commercially so i was willing to bet it was serviced regularly since i could see evidence of several oil change stickers in the windshield when i got it home and tore it down to the short block everything looked great no play in the pistons and good cross hatching on the cylinder walls i used the kit from yotashop to replace the head gaskets head bolts valve cover gaskets and intake gaskets i replaced the timing belt water pump and thermostat with aisin products i also put new plugs coil packs and wires on it i pulled my wiring harness all the way out of my 4runner so i could connect everything on the engine stand instead of trying to fight the connectors in the tight spaces in the car and it worked great i dropped my freshenedup junkyard motor in bolted it up to the transmission connected my wiring harness back up hooked all my vacuum lines up and was ready to go after realizing i missed one ground wire from the cylinder head to the firewall i got it running it was running a little rough and had a check engine light one code was for the upstream o2 sensor and one was for the maf sensor i let it idle for several minutes to let the ecu learn and then i tried to drive it around the block this is where the issues start it started to run rougher when i put it in gear and the motor had a load on it when driving it had very little power it would basically be very hesitant to rev up and it would take several seconds just to get to about 25mph i could tell something was way off when i was on my way back home i noticed the red oil light on the dash would come on when the rpm would go over about 1200 i immediately parked it and checked the oil level it was at the top dot when changed the oil when putting it back together i used high milage 10w30 when i cranked it again to check the light the same thing happen at idle no light when i reved it up it would eventually flicker and come on around 1200rpm i checked the electrical connection at the sending unit and everything was good there is no knocking or any sounds coming from the engine and every cylinder has good compression there is also plenty of oil in the top of the engine if i had an oil pressure issue wouldnt the light come when the engine is at low rpm i went ahead and replaced the maf and upstream o2 sensor and cleared the codes when i cranked it after this the engine was idling great i was really impressed with how smooth it was even under a load in gear with my foot on the break i went to take it for a test drive and same issue hardly any power struggled to reach 3500rpm and the oil pressure light came on when the engine was over about 1200rpm when i got back home i put it in park and put my foot on the floor the engine would not go over about 3500 rpm it is like it was hitting a limiter shouldnt the engine redline even in park or neutral i am completely stumped on what my issue could be there are no codes stored the fuel trims look great the engine is not knocking or smoking i have checked the fuel pressure it was great replaced the fuel pump checked for any vacuum leaks and cleaned the throttle body and double checked the timing belt installation was correct i have not checked the oil pressure yet with a manual gauge but other than that i am at the point where im not sure what to do does the oil pressure have anything to do with it having such little power thank you so much for any responses edit i was doing some reading could it be an issue with the ecu since i used the harness and ecu from the 4runner i used the 4runner throttle body btw",
    "the wong picks that make everything go right original article a disciplined look at the market giants shaping north americas next phase of growth north american equities are closing out 2025 with a sense of conviction that few anticipated at the beginning of the year markets have weathered rate volatility political noise and global uncertainty yet still find themselves supported by resilient corporate earnings strong liquidity and favourable seasonal trends that consistently lift the final quarter it is in this environment that stan wong portfolio manager at scotia wealth management presents a thoughtful and disciplined view of where the best opportunities lie the numbers speak for themselves more than 80 per cent of sp 500 companies exceeded third quarter earnings expectations a testament to durable profitability across multiple sectors united states money market assets have surged to a record seven point five trillion dollars sitting as latent capital that can rotate into equities as interest rates drift lower corporate share repurchases have remained aggressive adding further support to earnings per share growth and signalling confidence from boardrooms the macro backdrop tells a similar story economic conditions in the united states are cooling gradually rather than contracting creating a healthier balance between labour supply and demand unemployment has edged higher but remains historically low inflation continues to moderate and is inching closer to the federal reserves two per cent target expectations for another twenty five basis point cut in december have helped ease financial conditions and improved sentiment against this backdrop wongs investment framework emphasizes selectivity discipline and an unshakable focus on high quality businesses his preferred opportunities align with powerful structural themes including biopharmaceutical innovation the resurgence in global finance and the accelerating demand for advanced semiconductors in his november 13 2025 top picks wong highlights three market giants that he believes will define the next phase of growth eli lilly nyse lly goldman sachs group inc nyse gs and taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company ltd nyse tsm the case for quality and durability at the stan wong group the investment philosophy centres on large cap equities with strong fundamentals supported by short to intermediate term government and investment grade corporate bonds wongs approach is data driven and valuation disciplined he favours companies that have proven earnings power durable cash flow and competitive advantages that stretch beyond cyclical environments this emphasis on quality is especially relevant in a market where valuations are elevated and the margin for error has thinned the broader market outlook remains constructive analysts expect sp 500 earnings to grow nearly thirteen per cent in 2026 liquidity remains abundant technology innovation continues to unlock new economic value yet within this optimism wong maintains a sharp focus on businesses that can consistently deliver financial performance through multiple economic climates his three top picks reflect leadership in industries that are expanding consolidating or structurally indispensable eli lilly embodies the explosive growth of metabolic medicine and oncology innovation goldman sachs represents the renewal of global finance as capital markets reopen taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company stands at the centre of an unprecedented semiconductor supercycle eli lilly nyse lly a giant redefining global health care eli lilly has emerged as one of the most influential companies in the world rewriting the economics of healthcare and transforming the treatment landscape for diabetes obesity and cancer the company is expected to approach seventy six billion dollars in revenue in fiscal 2026 with earnings projected to grow at more than twenty per cent annually those numbers alone would be compelling yet they are only part of the story lillys metabolic portfolio has become a global phenomenon demand for its diabetes and obesity therapies continues to outpace supply even as production expands the company is not just meeting consumer needs but reshaping the global conversation around weight management public health and preventative care this momentum has been strengthened by a recent agreement with the us administration that will lower obesity drug prices across several channels in exchange for expanded medicare access and a temporary tariff grace period the outcome is improved affordability and far broader long term prescription growth beyond metabolic health lillys oncology division has become a rising force its therapies targeting breast lung and hematological cancers are positioned to become significant revenue drivers over the next several years these advancements reflect the companys disciplined research strategy that focuses on breakthrough areas rather than incremental improvements the company is investing heavily in global manufacturing capacity to meet demand by expanding production centres across north america and europe and upgrading distribution networks lilly is creating a foundation for sustainable long term growth its balance sheet remains strong with solid cash generation and reinvestment capacity that ensures its innovation pipeline stays robust wongs conviction in eli lilly is anchored in both science and financial durability in a world shaped by aging populations rising chronic disease rates and surging biologic innovation lilly is positioned not just as a leader but as a global bellwether for the future of healthcare goldman sachs nyse gs a financial powerhouse reclaiming momentum goldman sachs is reemerging as a dominant force in an improving financial landscape after a period marked by sluggish deal flow muted lending appetite and a cautious corporate environment the tide has turned with approximately three point four five trillion dollars in client assets under supervision and projected revenue exceeding sixty two billion dollars in fiscal 2026 goldman stands ready to benefit from a broad based market revival the firm is experiencing renewed strength across its core pillars investment banking is improving as equity and debt issuance reaccelerates trading performance remains robust thanks to heightened market participation and volatility asset and wealth management are expanding supported by strong fee generation and higher performance revenue this multi engine model creates a financial base that is both diversified and scalable wong notes that goldman has sharpened its strategic focus it has scaled back from non core consumer ventures and reinforced the areas where it holds enduring competitive advantages operational discipline has improved margins share repurchase programs remain steady the firms near two per cent dividend yield adds to its appeal as a long term holding political conditions may provide an additional tailwind a business friendly republican administration could spur deregulation reduce corporate taxes and encourage investment goldman is positioned to benefit from all these potential shifts longer term global wealth expansion and rising demand for alternative investments will drive advisory services private credit strategies and asset management growth wong views goldman sachs as uniquely positioned to capture this momentum thanks to its scale brand and deep institutional relationships taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company nyse tsm the worlds most critical chipmaker taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company is the backbone of the digital world with about 70 per cent of the global foundry market tsm is the manufacturing engine behind the chips that power artificial intelligence smartphones cloud computing automotive innovation and national security systems fiscal 2026 revenue is projected to approach one hundred fifty billion dollars and earnings growth is expected to reach nearly thirty per cent annually tsms dominance is rooted in its unmatched technological leadership it produces the worlds most advanced chips sustaining a generational lead over competitors its three nanometre process is already in mass production and significant progress has been made toward two nanometre technology this leadership underpins long standing partnerships with apple nvidia amd qualcomm and other global titans that depend on tsm to execute their most ambitious engineering breakthroughs the company is also reshaping its geographic footprint new fabrication facilities in the united states japan and europe are strengthening supply chain security and aligning with government incentives aimed at reshoring semiconductor manufacturing for investors this global expansion reduces geopolitical risks and supports multi decade demand growth wong sees tsm not as a semiconductor company but as a foundational pillar of the global economy artificial intelligence is accelerating at a pace that requires exponential compute power data centres are expanding rapidly electric and autonomous vehicles are becoming chip intensive machines military systems increasingly rely on advanced semiconductors for surveillance communications and aerospace technology tsm sits at the centre of all these long horizon growth drivers a market rewarding discipline and vision as 2025 winds down stan wongs top picks capture the essence of where the markets most compelling opportunities lie these companies stand not only on financial strength but on structural relevance eli lilly represents the future of healthcare goldman sachs embodies the resurgence of global finance tsm is the central nervous system of the technological era for investors preparing for 2026 wongs insights offer clarity in a market filled with noise his emphasis on quality durability and long term trends underscores an approach rooted in stability rather than speculation in a world where narratives shift quickly and sentiment can swing overnight wongs message remains steady focus on companies building the future rather than those merely riding it conclusion the market environment of late 2025 is defined by resilience liquidity and evolving economic dynamics with expectations for continued rate cuts expanding corporate earnings and accelerating innovation cycles the foundation for 2026 appears strong through his top picks stan wong highlights three enterprises that showcase powerful secular growth strategic clarity and financial durability each reinforces a central truth about modern investing true leadership is timeless and true opportunity aligns with the forces shaping the next generation",

    "psa to all please use your eyes and turn your head to look at the road when moving around the roads i know this is gonna be preachy and that im beating a dead horse here but i just nearly got nailed three times on my 15minute bike commute theoretically bikes should be very safe to move in the designated bike infrastructure that i use and yet all three of the incidents were along bike boulevardmarked shared lanes the tldr of this is that all of the incidents could have been prevented by people using their eyes to look at what is on the road so please use your eyes and look for all traffic not just carstrucks thanks for your consideration in case you havent thought about it for a while here are some basic tips to keep yourself and other humans safe 1 do not use your phone while you are moving on roads you are not as good as you think you have no idea what you dont see because you dont see it you havent caused a collision yet because people are avoiding you not because youre such an amazing driver or cyclist or walker even while scrolling through your phone 2 please look including checking your blindspots before you pull out into traffic this includes if youre pulling out of a driveway out of a parallel parking spot randomly backing up out of a notquitedriveway downtown etc 3 addendum dont depend on your ears to sense if a vehicle or a bike or a pedestrian is approaching use your eyes and turn your head to look this is more of a pedestrian issue but some drivers and bicyclists seem to do it as well pedestrians bikes and electric cars can all be very quiet please look 4 please be predictable dont be nice this goes for both drivers and cyclists four way stops are sketchy enough with midwesterners trying to be nice adding waving a bike through not knowing if anybody else at the four way stop has you know seen the bike makes it even worse 5 bikes the idaho stop is unfortunately not legal here but also the idaho stop is meant for safely rolling through an intersection not going whenever honestly imo idaho stop to your hearts content but that doesnt turn everything into a green light incidents today and the principles that would have prevented them and before you ask i always run lights on my bike headlight taillight and blinky light pointing towards the front tire and i have dayglo orange on my helmet i am visible to anybody that looks 1 a driver pulled quickly out of their driveway on a bike boulevard i presume she did not look both of us had to slam on our brakes with squealing on both sides so i didnt go flying over their hood i was about a foot from a flying lesson how this could have been prevented tip 2 look carefully before pulling out even on quiet streets you may want to inch out if your visibility in your car is poor especially if there are cars parked along the curb my head was above the cars parked on the curb and like i said i run lights and my helmet is gloorange so if this driver had taken their time to look they would have seen me 2 a true cluster a truck and i pull up to a 4way stop around the same time but truck is clearly there first he motions for me to go i think but maybe not as a bus pulls up to cross our paths i refuse to go as bus interprets trucks handwaving as letting the bus go bus did not see me at all even though i was coming from where they are going to turn into bus goes and i have to move off the road because they didnt actually have room to turn into my road tight right turn then the truck goes then i start to go as another truck that was behind the bus starts trying to go how this could have been prevented tips 3 and 4 please just follow laws drivers make sure the bike isnt going but just do what youre supposed to bikes also behave like youre supposed to at a fourway stop and dont let people wave you through unless its truly ambiguous and you are positive that nobody else is going to go through instead if you can slip through without intersecting paths then whatever but also dont assume people are signaling because apparently half of they time they arent or they do it as an afterthought right as they turn into you 3 similar situation a truck and i pull up to a 4way stop but this time the truck is stopped well before im even at the stop bar truck waves at me to go after ive stopped i refuse an suv pulls up on a cross street truck goes i start to take my turn but am cut off by the suv who apparently didnt see me at all she didnt even turn her head as i flailed my arm at her about 5 feet from her window how this could have been prevented tip 2 and 4 please look and dont just look for cars look for bikes and pedestrians too for people who dont know what the idaho stop is in places with idaho stop bikes can treat a stop sign as a yield and a stop light as a stop sign so basically go when safe and follow rightofway laws this helps clear intersections better which are generally very dangerous places for bikes",

    "need help understanding how the 25 year old car emission inspection exemption works in ny hello everyone im not in syracuse but im a little up north and didnt know where else to ask this question ive found conflicting information on how the 25 year old car emission inspection exemption works on the surface it looks like cars that are 25 years old or older are exempt from emissions inspections according this this page from the dmv website most new york state vehicle inspections include a check of the onboard diagnostic system obdii this includes a test of vehicle emissions control systems designed to reduce air pollution and keep new york state in compliance with the federal clean air act diesel vehicles receive a diesel emissions inspection at the time of the safety inspection vehicles are exempt from emissions inspection if they are motorcycles less than two model years old the model year is greater than or equal to the calendar year minus one more than 25 model years old the model year is less than or equal to the calendar year minus 25 dieselpowered except dieselpowered vehicles that are 1997 or newer and that have a gross vehicle weight rating gvrw of less than 8501 pounds electricpowered issued historical plates subject to the heavy vehicle safety inspection so according to this a car 25 years old would be exempt from an obdii test theres also this excerpt from a different dmv page onboard diagnostics generation ii obdii inspection most 1996 or newer gasolinepowered vehicles and most 1997 or newer dieselpowered vehicles that have a gross vehicle weight rating gvwr less than 8501 pounds are subject to the obdii emissions inspection this test examines the malfunction indicator lamp mil also known as the check engine light for operationillumination and verifies the test results of the vehicles onboard emissions diagnostic system low enhanced inspection a low enhanced emissions inspection is required for most other vehicles unless they are subject to the obdii test or are exempt from all emissions inspections this inspection is required for all vehicles from and including model year 1996 and older through and including vehicles that are up to 25 model years old and that weigh 18000 lbs or less each emissions inspection for gasolinepowered vehicles confirms the presence and connection of the vehicles required emissions control devices this includes making sure that the vehicles gas cap is present is in good condition and fits properly so according to this it seems that any car after 1996 made with obdii is required to have the test done regardless of its age this matters to me because i have a 1999 turbocharged miata thats running an aftermarket ecu that cannot be plugged into obdii i have no problem getting a visual inspection as a have a catalytic converter pcv evap and eveything else i just cant plug into the obdii of course the nuclear option would be to tear the thing back apart put back all the oem stuff and send it in for inspection and put it back together but thats a pain to do every year i could also think about getting historic plates but that would limit my usage of the car ive gone to a local mechanic and he told me that any car made with obd2 after 1996 is required to be plugged in but ive heard conflicting information from others so before i go try again at a different place does anyone have any experience or knowledge on this subject thank you",

    "warning check your backseat warning check your backseat i wasnt worried about the message when it first popped up its one of those things they put in these days to make sure no one leaves a child in a hot car i guess it hadnt ever shown me that warning before but i figured maybe a passenger had left a purse on the floor or something and it was detecting the weight there wasnt anything there though i looked under the seats and everything even ran my hands along the back edge to see if there was a wallet or phone stuck in the crack i didnt think that sort of thing would set off the alarm but the car was still fairly new so i couldnt be sure regardless nothing was there id forgotten about it by the end of the next day honestly but when i pulled into my driveway and turned off the car there it was again on my dashboard i checked the backseat again still nothing i hadnt had any messages from passengers looking for any lost items either maybe this was just a thing the car did just a general warning to remind drivers to check the backseat every time they got out if so it felt counterproductive if the warning was there every time people were bound to start ignoring it it would just become part of the background also i was sure that the car hadnt been doing this for the first several months id had it on the other hand this was the sort of change they might have pushed through a software update there could have been some new legislation some lobbying group pushing to have this warning on permanently like the meaningless parental advisory stickers on music i looked online that night searching through car forums and news posts for any mention of this warning i couldnt find any indication that it was supposed to be happening every time i turned the car off in fact it didnt seem to be showing up for anyone else this problem was only in my car clearly it was just a bad sensor it was probably still under warranty but in order to get it fixed id still have to leave it at the dealership for a day and the warranty wasnt going to pay my lost income for the day off i told myself i could just ignore it it was just a single line of text id stop noticing it in no time i was wrong every time i turned the car off that message glared at me like a dire omen i found myself obsessively checking the backseat every time i got out even though i knew id find nothing i vacuumed the car until not so much as a crumb remained i checked the seatbelt latches everything was perfect but the warning still appeared i tried ignoring it i averted my eyes when i turned the car off but i could feel it glowing from the deactivated dash see the phantom words printed across the darkness of my eyelids i walked away from the car without looking in the back telling myself that it was a waste of time and there was nothing to find i knew i was right of course but i found myself wide awake at three in the morning staring at the ceiling and thinking what if i ended up kneeling in the street in my pajamas with my phone flashlight on looking under the seats for something i knew wouldnt be there the backseat was as empty as always the warning haunted me constantly i only saw it when i stopped the car but i knew it was always coming i began to watch the backseat constantly eyes flicking to the rearview mirror more than was safe or reasonable my passengers noticed my rating began to dip with notes marking concerns about attentiveness to the road my tips suffered as well finally i bit the bullet and took the car in to get the sensor fixed the warning mocked me as i parked it in the lot daring me to go inside without looking i wanted to i knew there was nothing there but if i claimed there was a sensor issue and they found a bag or a box or some other physical object sitting back there id look like i was too dumb to have just checked the backseat i knew i had checked it i had checked it a thousand times but i looked once more just to be sure i explained my problem to the man at the counter he typed some notes into his computer and said gonna be a few hours until we can get you in thats fine i said ill wait you sure you dont hav he began i cut him off more emphatically than i intended there is nothing in the backseat i have looked all right all right he said raising his hands to placate me just trying to save you some time in case i went to look again after that i really couldnt have stood being wrong at that point it was empty it was always empty i knew every crevice of that backseat now there was nothing there i sat in the waiting room drinking coffee and playing on my phone i was inexplicably nervous i couldnt figure out why it was just a sensor issue they would find it and fix it the problem would go away it was crazy that id waited this long that id let it get to me this much finally they called me back up to the front well we cant find anything wrong with your car the mechanic said what do you mean theres absolutely nothing in the backseat i have made very sure of that backseats clean as a whistle sure but we cant get that warning to turn on either not without someone in the backseat it cuts on like its supposed to with a person back there but if its just the driver it doesnt show my expression must have been somewhere between disbelief and rage the mechanic took a step back look ill come show you i calmed myself and followed him out to the garage he turned on the car while i watched through the window he let it run for a moment then turned it off no message appeared see he said we can replace the part if you want but since we cant find an issue its not going to be covered under warranty and weve got to take the entire back seat out to do it so theres gonna be a decent labor fee i ignored him and got into the car i turned it on and then with trepidation turned it back off for the first time in weeks no warning appeared the rush of relief i felt was incredible i turned the car on and off again several more times there was no message the warning was gone you happy the mechanic asked unbelievably i said he shrugged wish they were all this easy i drove home feeling like i was floating i hadnt realized how much tension i had been carrying or how much my car had begun to feel like a prison the road was broad and open the day was beautiful i was free in my peripheral vision a light flickered something on the passenger side of the car had blinked out a little orange light i could not remember ever having paid attention to before i stared sharply at it now trying to figure out what had been illuminated it blinked briefly again on just long enough for me to read it passenger airbag off it stayed on whenever there was no one in the front passenger seat it was off now the final short blink could have been anything it could have been an led failing a sensor breaking any of a thousand electrical glitches or it could have been something settling itself into the passenger seat i pulled over to the side of the road i left the car running when i got out i did not look back as i walked away there was no point i knew there was nothing in the backseat anymore i never went back for the car the police called a few days later theyd found my vehicle they said some kids had taken it out joyriding it was in bad shape so were the kids they were reviewing the dashcam footage but did i want a copy for my insurance i shouldnt have watched it i knew that before i ever put the thumbdrive in my computer but i had to know they were laughing at first whooping and hollering as they sped away down the street all clearly having fun at first pretty soon though one of them starts cautioning the driver to slow down the panic starts then screaming that the pedals wont work the wheel wont turn the doors wont open all the while the speed on the display is creeping higher and higher it ends as youd expect im sure therell be questions about why i left my car with the keys in it whether i knew something was wrong i suppose the clean bill of health i got from the dealership that day will be useful in proving my innocence im not worried about that right now though my ring doorbell is notifying me that theres someone on my front porch but the camera shows nothing at all",

playing on my phone i was inexplicably nervous i couldnt figure out why it was just a sensor issue they would find it and fix it the problem would go away it was crazy that id waited this long that id let it get to me this much finally they called me back up to the front well we cant find anything wrong with your car the mechanic said what do you mean theres absolutely nothing in the backseat i have made very sure of that backseats clean as a whistle sure but we cant get that warning to turn on either not without someone in the backseat it cuts on like its supposed to with a person back there but if its just the driver it doesnt show my expression must have been somewhere between disbelief and rage the mechanic took a step back look ill come show you i calmed myself and followed him out to the garage he turned on the car while i watched through the window he let it run for a moment then turned it off no message appeared see he said we can replace the part if you want but since we cant find an issue its not going to be covered under warranty and weve got to take the entire back seat out to do it so theres gonna be a decent labor fee i ignored him and got into the car i turned it on and then with trepidation turned it back off for the first time in weeks no warning appeared the rush of relief i felt was incredible i turned the car on and off again several more times there was no message the warning was gone you happy the mechanic asked unbelievably i said he shrugged wish they were all this easy i drove home feeling like i was floating i hadnt realized how much tension i had been carrying or how much my car had begun to feel like a prison the road was broad and open the day was beautiful i was free in my peripheral vision a light flickered something on the passenger side of the car had blinked out a little orange light i could not remember ever having paid attention to before i stared sharply at it now trying to figure out what had been illuminated it blinked briefly again on just long enough for me to read it passenger airbag off it stayed on whenever there was no one in the front passenger seat it was off now the final short blink could have been anything it could have been an led failing a sensor breaking any of a thousand electrical glitches or it could have been something settling itself into the passenger seat i pulled over to the side of the road i left the car running when i got out i did not look back as i walked away there was no point i knew there was nothing in the backseat anymore i never went back for the car the police called a few days later theyd found my vehicle they said some kids had taken it out joyriding it was in bad shape so were the kids they were reviewing the dashcam footage but did i want a copy for my insurance i shouldnt have watched it i knew that before i ever put the thumbdrive in my computer but i had to know they were laughing at first whooping and hollering as they sped away down the street all clearly having fun at first pretty soon though one of them starts cautioning the driver to slow down the panic starts then screaming that the pedals wont work the wheel wont turn the doors wont open all the while the speed on the display is creeping higher and higher it ends as youd expect im sure therell be questions about why i left my car with the keys in it whether i knew something was wrong i suppose the clean bill of health i got from the dealership that day will be useful in proving my innocence im not worried about that right now though my ring doorbell is notifying me that theres someone on my front porch but the camera shows nothing at all",

    "deflationary crisis explained chinese economic analysis from a chinese leftist perspective many western economists and media outlets have a very shallow understanding of chinas deflation crisis their analyses are filled with misconceptions reminiscent of the 2008 financial crisis yet ironically they are not entirely wrong thus simply dismissing their analysis is not helpful for understanding the chinese economy as a leftist from china i would like to briefly introduce the current state of chinas economy i will refer to many concepts from existing economic theory even though i am not a believer in socalled mainstream economics please keep that in mind i will also cite some chineselanguage sources which nonchinese readers may have to rely on google translate to understand the article is originally written in chinese and then chatgpt translated to english 1 the real estate bubble after china joined the wto in 2001 the economy experienced explosive growth followed by rapid industrialization and urbanization large numbers of rural residents began migrating into cities and local governments across the country faced a new challenge how to provide enough housing for these new urban residents here we must note a uniquely chinese characteristic land in china is publicly owned the government wields neartotal control over urban planning and thus the responsibility to meet housing needs partly falls on the state however due to structural issues in the tax system local governments have long been in a state of fiscal deficit this goes back to chinas taxsharing reform under which local governments receive only a small portion of total tax revenue but thats another topic so ill set it aside for now because of this local governments were not allowed to build housing directly through fiscal surpluses nor could they directly participate as developers however they could own companies through state ownership as a result a model originating from britishruled hong kong began to spread across the mainland local governments could sell land to cover budget deficits while providing sufficient housing for residents this model is now widely known as land finance under the land finance model local governments establish stateowned financing companies known as local government financing vehicles lgfvs whose ownership lies under the local fiscal authority these lgfvs purchase land and undertake preliminary infrastructure work such as road paving and water electricity and gas installation once this development is completed the land is soldtechnically its renting through bidding to real estate developers the profits from these land sales are then used to fill local fiscal gaps while preparing for future real estate development this system seems ideal at first glance the government gains revenue developers get projects and residents receive housing but setting aside the corruption that often occurs during bidding the core issue lies elsewhere once local governments become dependent on land finance due to chronic fiscal pressure they have no choice but to ensure that land prices continue to rise more residents mean higher administrative costs and heavier responsibilities which further increases the need for landsale revenues as the landfinance model expanded by 2014 virtually every local government in china was using it to sustain fiscal operations the only difference lay in how much it contributed to their local budgets the six years between 2014 and 2020 also marked the period when chinas real estate bubble began to swell first the housepricetoincome ratios in firsttier cities surpassed those in europe california and even hong kong this meant that based on the average local wage a family would need to work continuously for 20 or even 30 years without spending a cent to afford a home yet at the time this did not seem to be a major concern because expectations of rising wages driven by economic growth outweighed the pressure of 20year mortgages among newly married couples it was common for both sets of parents to help gather funds for a down payment a phenomenon colloquially known as the six wallets the savings of the husband wife and both pairs of parents supporting this trend data show that chinas household debttogdp ratio rose from less than 35 in 2014 to 63 in 2020 soon even second and thirdtier cities where there was little genuine additional demand for housing experienced surging property prices from that point onward we can say chinas real estate bubble truly began to spiral out of control the massive revenues local governments earned from land finance led them to embark on infrastructure and longterm investment projects far exceeding the needs of their populations while their local government financing vehicles lgfvs accumulated enormous debt just how large was the role of land finance according to the data ive reviewed at its peak in 2021 land finance accounted for an average of 35 of local government fiscal revenue nationwide moreover in some chineselanguage reports land transfer fees made up as much as 70 of housing prices in firsttier cities and about 50 in secondtier cities on average meanwhile real estate developers abandoned conservative investment strategies instead taking on massive debt and accelerating project turnover to expand at breakneck speed the most infamous private example was evergrande even some central stateowned enterprises soes under the ministry of finance entered the real estate market including poly group yes the same one that exports military equipment and china resources everything seemed glorious until the covid19 pandemic struck in 2020 2 covid19 and the stalled economy the covid19 pandemic and ensuing lockdowns dealt a massive blow to the global economy in the united states the surge of inflation can be traced directly back to the pandemic for china however it marked the bursting of the real estate bubble as property developers across the country faced cash flow crises and declared bankruptcy due to a sharp drop in new home sales local governments suddenly realized that their primary fiscal lifeline land finance was collapsing as well after all if no developers were buying land not only would budget deficits return in full force but the local government financing vehicles lgfvs already heavily indebted and deeply entangled with local governments would become a major problem this is why some western economists often refer to chinas hidden debt the debts of lgfvs do not appear in official local government budgets yet anyone familiar with the landfinance system knows that lgfvs are essentially extensions of local governments thus this unreported portion of debt is what economists describe as implicit or hidden liabilities the bankruptcy of local real estate companies inevitably affected employment and economic expectations in their regions for example in zhengzhou the administrative center of henan province a large share of local gdp came from the real estate sector for residents who had taken on heavy mortgages during the boom years rising unemployment and stagnant wages dealt an even heavier blow to make matters worse during the peak of chinas real estate bubble a sales model known as presale became widespread a practice imported from britishruled hong kong under this model developers sold homes before construction was completed allowing them to recover funds in advance in theory this system was supposed to be tightly regulated developers were required to keep a certain amount of funds in escrow accounts ensuring that even if they went bankrupt or suffered a liquidity crisis enough money would remain to complete the housing projects and protect buyers rights however when the real estate bubble actually burst many discovered that this system had become a mere formality the escrow funds had long been misappropriated by developers often with the tacit approval of local governments as a result many homebuyers were left with unfinished or abandoned buildings despite having already taken out large loans to pay for their homes this is why chinas rottentail building unfinished housing crisis is far more severe than western observers typically imagine more importantly the real estate sector and its related industries occupy a huge share of chinas economy according to chinas national bureau of statistics real estate alone accounts for roughly 6 of gdp when including upstream and downstream industries such as steel cement and infrastructure construction the total economic impact rises sharply chineselanguage sources estimate that the broader real estate ecosystem accounts for about 15 of gdp while studies from stanford university and bloomberg offer even more striking figures as high as 314 regardless of which estimate one accepts the conclusion is clear the collapse of chinas real estate sector has had an enormous and undeniable impact on both the economy and employment 3 the deflationary spiral when households are burdened with heavy debt while wage growth stagnates the pressure of debt intensifies sharply lets imagine a simple example in 2017 a man named a bought a small 60squaremeter apartment in chengdu at that time the average housing price in chengdu was about 12000 yuan per square meter meaning his total mortgage was 720000 yuan the average mortgage interest rate in china then was 49 and if we assume his annual salary was around 80000 yuan on the high side that would mean a monthly income of about 6670 yuan under a 20year loan at 49 interest as monthly payment would be 4712 yuan leaving him with roughly 2000 yuan in disposable income each month over 20 years he would pay a total of 1131000 yuan it looks tough but he might think at least my salary will rise over time right unfortunately the pandemic hit in 2020 and he almost lost his job assuming his salary grew at an average rate of 4 per year by 2020 he would be earning about 90000 yuan annually or 7500 yuan per month leaving him with 2780 yuan in disposable income after paying the mortgage but the uncertainty of income made him realize that this 20year mortgage was a damoclean sword hanging over him if he ever lost his job bankruptcy would be inevitable although china does not have a personal bankruptcy system as a result a decided to cut all nonessential spending saving as much as possible each month either to prepare for emergencies or to pay off the mortgage early and this is actually a relatively optimistic scenario according to chengdus own statistics the average annual wage for privatesector employees rose by less than 7 between 2017 and 2024 and thats just the average one of the most notoriously misleading statistics in economics when we look at as case we can see that chinas deflation does not come from overproduction as many western economists assume quite the opposite it comes from consumers weighed down by debt accumulated during the housing bubble and faced with declining income expectations being forced to cut spending thus pushing the market to demand lower prices because consumers can no longer afford higherpriced goods businesses are forced to cut profit margins and costs prioritizing quantity over quality this is the true root of chinas ongoing deflation western economists have mistaken cause and effect just as they fail to understand why us inflation remains so stubborn however the phenomena they observe are real deflation in china inevitably harms businesses and employment which in turn further suppress wages and job opportunities worsening the debt burden of consumers like a this leads to further spending cuts creating a vicious deflationary spiral this same pattern appeared in japan following the collapse of its real estate bubble leading to what is now called the lost thirty years chinas current predicament bears many striking similarities to japans experience at that time as chinese firms recognize the shrinking domestic consumer market many have turned outward seeking to import demand from abroad this explains why chinas exports have grown by nearly 8 while imports have stagnated or even fallen into negative growth ironically the postpandemic export boom in sectors such as electric vehicles and solar panels is often viewed by western observers as evidence of the overwhelming success of chinese manufacturing yet from within china it is better understood as a symptom of internal weakness a reluctant move born out of domestic economic hardship 4 two sides of the same coin in the end why have i spent so much time describing the current state of chinas economy one reason of course is to help western audiences especially those on the american left gain a deeper understanding of china rather than stopping at surfacelevel impressions china is indeed a capitalist country while it enjoys the progress that capitalism brings it also suffers from capitalisms inherent contradictions much like japan once did state control over capital is not a magic cure for these contradictions especially when the state apparatus itself becomes part of the capitalist system but theres an even deeper reason china and the united states are in reality two sides of the same coin yanis varoufakis in his book the global minotaur vividly described how wall street constructed the global financial order in short entrepreneurs around the world earned us dollars by selling goods to america then reinvested those dollars back into wall street helping the us to invest around the world and further reinforce its financial hegemony in india this hegemony manifests in mumbai in china it appears in hong kong and in japan it takes the form of the socalled mrs watanabe phenomenon building on varoufakiss analysis i want to add a crucial point china holds a unique position within this global economic system since joining the wto chinas participation has fundamentally reshaped the global trade order the united states still sits at the top siphoning global financial resources for its own profit while china has become the worlds factory almost monopolizing global manufacturing only a few countries such as germany japan and south korea have managed to retain competitive advantages in certain industries but even their positions are being challenged the remaining developing countries have few choices left once they realize that the cost of domestic industrialization far exceeds the cost of importing inexpensive chinese goods they can only join the global economic order by supplying raw materials to china thus you can see projects in the belt and road initiative from this perspective china is not only one of the few beneficiaries of the neoliberal order but its existence has also stifled opportunities for industrial development in much of the global south no matter how often chinese communist party leaders emphasize that china is part of the third world this structural contradiction cannot be ignored china depends on american consumption to maintain its manufacturing dominance while the united states depends on chinese production to sustain its financial hegemony their coexistence mutually reinforces each other together constructing the neoliberal economic order of the 21st century in this sense china and the united states are two sides of the same neoliberal coin i believe that the ccp establishment as the primary beneficiaries of this system understand this dynamic better than anyone but as a leftist from china i can say that i understand perhaps better than many western leftists the costs that this global order imposes and i also know that to change it both the united states and china will have to make major sacrifices so next time you read an article about china like this try to recall some of what ive said here its true that much of western medias coverage of china begins from an unfriendly standpoint but using that as an excuse to dismiss all negative criticism would not be the attitude of a mature and principled leftist",
    "vertical aerospace a battle for british allied air superiority image courtesy of the peoples mosquito ltd okay so the title and its reference to the war wont have been missed by the observant reader in using such a title i want you to think of a time of brave deeds and unity amongst the good people of many nations in overcoming oppression a time for bold decisions and creativity that led to british firms such as supermarine hawker avro de havilland and fairey creating aircraft of world renown some may consider my reference to war crass but i beg to differ so let me explain my reasoning my paternal grandfather flew for the royal air force during the war in the wooden wonder de havilland mosquito the aircraft pictured above and my maternal grandfather was one of paddys men in the sas both fought alongside many others to ensure our current freedom including a right to reasonable free speech and the narrative that follows is thanks to those brave people and those that supported them the metaphor has been chosen as i wanted for firstly draw attention to the aircraft industry britain once had but is no more parts remain such as those within rollsroyce plc bae systems as well as airbus but in the present day no sovereign aircraft manufacturer of scale exists in britain you and i have an opportunity to change that as i will come onto later the metaphor was also chosen to add gravity to the grand vision i painted in my article last year on the fourth mass rapid transport revolution ie locomotives motor vehicles airliners and now evtol aircraft that will take various acts of courage to achieve as a nation by government ministers and civil servants business leaders and investors alike rather than leaving the opportunity to foreign entities as is so often the case in modern britain i have not lost my ancestral courage have you courage to back a british based aviation firm that has the potential to be a world leader in a nascent industry that could one day be vast and according to morgan stanley a 15 trillion market by 2040 a market that due to apparently favourable operational costs low noise profile and zero emissions could well provide a new method of rapid mass transport for the many not just the few an industry that could benefit so many other industries such as travel tourism and logistics in my opinion it will require courage from government ministers and civil servants courage to take bold decisions to ensure we do not lose this promising catalyst for growth and clean electric transport to foreign bidders we must retain sovereignty otherwise future generations will look back aghast at those who squandered an opportunity to secure a potential world leader with innovation and highly skilled manufacturing at its heart in my opinion it will require courage from business leaders courage to ally ones business with vertical aerospace in its mission to make the giant leap towards a cleaner faster quieter future while one day possibly sharing the potential profits of a vast future market with existing domestic and international allies such as gkn leonardo dassault systems and honeywell there lies an opportunity for a visionary business leader to reinforce and potentially profit substantially from that alliance by becoming part of it in my opinion it will require courage from investors courage from both professionals and retail investors alike to see the opportunity despite the dark clouds formed of uncertainty in a troubled world courage to take a stake in a business without the certainty of success but one which offers hope of a better future and rich rewards to not only profit but to know you helped usher in that better future okay so lets consider a possible framework for achieving this courageous feat firstly in the coming weeks i expect to see the successful completion of transition flight tests for vertical aerospaces vx4 prototype aircraft as stuart simpson ceo of vertical aerospace recently said and the big unlock we talked about is transition once youve done that youve proved out the whole concept of the aircraft literally then im shrink wrapping it and certifying it as part of this process i hope to see retail and more adventurous professional investors playing a part through buying shares like my better half and i of vertical aerospace nyse evtl i would expect all things being equal for the share price to rise as that is the dynamics of supply and demand with a scarce resource ie a currently fixed number of shares that as i have outlined in a recent post about why vertical aerospace is worth possibly over 13x its current price will hopefully see a share price comfortably above 700 by late 2025 weeks away this then potentially unlocks an opportunity in early 2026 for the british government to become a keystone investor by investing 250 million 21 stake at a 7 placing price in a firm subsequently valued at about 12 billion while also taking up a golden share to ensure future sovereignty of this strategic national asset this would in turn hopefully unlock matched financing of 250 million from a strategic business partner or partners i admit i have a soft spot for jaguar land rover for various reasons including that my grandfather went on to work for them after the war as a draughtsman but also for reasons such as synergies in geographic location mass production expertise and their plans for a gigafactory in somerset close to verticals centre of operations in bristol bae systems would be another prime candidate for various reasons including the potential for verticals anticipated hybrid evtol with longer range and higher payload having significant potential for the defence industry with its relatively low noise and thermal signature profile lending itself to special forces operations or one day autonomous logistics away from the front lines for example i also like the thought of rollsroyce being involved given their aviation heritage and first class manufacturing setup perhaps a combination of all three may be a possibility should that come to pass i suspect many investors will probably be thinking right now but what about the dilution well that is something i willingly accept since a well financed firm with the potential to achieve commercialisation in h2 2028 offers the prospect of 5x to 10x even after dilution in the medium term in my opinion especially when you consider that an effective market capitalisation of about 12 billion would still be currently far less than us peers archer aviation 52b beta technologies 73b and joby aviation 135b to finish it seems clear to me that a generational opportunity presents itself to our nation an opportunity for potential british and allied air superiority a european evtol aviation champion of the near future the only question is will our government and business leaders have the courage to grasp it ps if you like the look of the de havilland mosquito above please consider a donation to the peoples mosquito project a charity established with the aim of returning a britishbuilt mosquito to the skies",

to the overriding goal of global collaboration serving as a political double agent that prioritizes national needs only within a framework designed for eventual international interoperability once in power in multiple countries the party would transition to its collaborative phase by introducing coordinated policy initiatives and establishing nonsovereign multilateral bodies gdap members across different nations would form a shadow parliament or global caucus to precoordinate votes on issues like corporate tax harmonization and climate treaties the ultimate goal is to empower a global democracy council gdc with delegated authority over strictly transnational issues that national governments cannot solve alone adhering to the principle of subsidiarity the core challenge remains overcoming voter fears of losing national sovereignty while selling the gdap not as a monolithic platform but as a superior methodology for democratic problemsolving on a planetary scale phase 1 national entry and initial strategy the first challenge is how the party would function within existing national political systems while maintaining a unified global platform 1 the local manifestos the individualistic shell national adaptation the gdap in each country eg gdapusa gdapgermany gdapindia would need to adopt a platform tailored to the immediate local needs of that nation to gain traction for example gdapusa would focus on healthcare and infrastructure within the us framework but its proposals would always be structured to be interoperable with the global goal the global core the open secret while the national platform is the tool for entry the partys raison dtre its fundamental purpose remains its commitment to global democratic cooperation this has to be the unchanging first principle stated openly in its national constitutions funding and structure how would it avoid being accused of foreign interference decentralized fundraising strictly national funding mechanisms to comply with local laws centralized ideological council a small nongoverning body the global secretariat would maintain ideological consistency and coordinate communication among the national parties but it would have no formal power over national policy until the next phase 2 candidate profile and appeal the double agent politician candidates must be deeply committed to the nation they represent while also subscribing to the ultimate goal of global collaboration this requires highly principled individuals who can navigate the tension between national duty and global vision targeting the electorate the gdaps appeal would likely be strongest among global citizenscosmopolitans those who travel work internationally or are deeply concerned with global issues climate pandemics pragmatists those tired of nationalistic gridlock and seeing a practical unified solution to complex transnational problems phase 2 building collaborative governance once gdap branches are in power even as a coalition partner in several nations they could begin building the collaborative structures 1 the coordinated policy initiative instead of proposing a world government overnight the gdap could introduce policies that require global coordination global standardizing treaties agreements on common noncontroversial issues first examples corporate tax harmonization eliminating tax havens within the alliance shared infrastructure standards unified electric vehicle charging networks common data security protocols the shadow parliament members of parliament congress etc from gdap parties in different countries would form an informal global caucus this caucus would meet regularly to precoordinate their votes on international treaties trade agreements and shared initiatives creating a unified bloc that governments must negotiate with 2 institutionalizing cooperation the longterm goal would be to move from informal coordination to a formal multilateral body empowered by treaties the global democracy council gdc this would not replace national parliaments but it would have delegated authority over transnational issues like climate change response pandemic preparedness and potentially peacekeeping its members would be gdap politicians elected on their national tickets the major philosophical and practical challenges this thought experiment faces significant hurdles that need consideration sovereignty national populations and competing parties will view this as an abdication of national control to a foreign unelected body principle of subsidiarity the gdap would argue that the gdc only handles issues that cannot be solved nationally eg deepsea mining asteroid defense ensuring local control remains for local matters culturalpolitical homogeneity the political issues in japan are vastly different from those in brazil or the uk a single platform risks being too generic to be meaningful the gdap as a methodology not a single policy the core is not what policies are but the method of democratic collaborative policymaking the local parties would retain significant policy freedom unified only by the commitment to collaboration the enemy bloc the existence of the gdap would likely provoke a strong reaction from nondemocratic and isolationist nations potentially solidifying an anticooperation alliance soft power and economic integration the gdap alliance would offer superior trade scientific collaboration and economic stability to any nation that joins making the benefits too great to ignore over time democratic legitimacy if the global secretariat dictates national platforms is the local election truly democratic transparency and referendums the gdap would need to hold internal public votesreferendums for all participating party members to ratify the central goals and coordinated global strategies",
