    "why some people feel like destiny the rare karmic geometry behind unexpected connections a lagneshmitra presentation good evening to the readers from where ever you are in the globe every once in a while you meet someone who doesnt feel new they feel like a memory returning a familiar frequency a strange comfort you cant logically justify you dont know why but your nervous system recognizes them before your mind does astrology has a name for this phenomenon karmic geometry its not soulmate talk not prediction not we are meant to be its simply the mathematics of timing emotional frequency karmic imprint overlapping for a brief window in your life heres what astrologers the serious ones not memepages actually mean when they talk about karmic resonance 1 every major connection has a timing window in astrology the when matters as much as the who connections that shake you whether they blossom break confuse inspire or just pass through usually arrive during ketu cycles truth detachment karmic resurfacing rahu cycles shock obsession rapid growth saturn cycles lessons grounding realitychecks jupiter cycles expansion emotional clarity venus transits affection comfort memory activation these periods create a psychological climate where deeper encounters feel more intense not because they are destined but because you are more receptive think of it like this your internal weather forecast determines the emotional intensity of whoever you meet 2 ketu venus the memory door opens ketu is the planet of dj vu dreams past tendencies unconscious memory internal surrender when venus overlaps ketu astrologers note emotional memory surfaces people feel familiar you sense layers that words cant touch its not magic its psychology amplified by timing your emotional walls lower your intuition rises your subconscious becomes louder you dont fall for the person you fall into a state of openness the person becomes the trigger the timing is the real reason 3 nakshatra chemistry is real but not romantic western astrology focuses on signs vedic astrology focuses on nakshatras 27 archetypal emotional patterns two people dont need matching signs they need interlocking emotional rhythms for example anuradha loyalty soft eyes emotional depth vishakha indecision attraction conflict mula root truth emotional stripping down swati independence mental wander rohini sensuality emotional cling ashwini impulsive beginnings jyestha sudden intensity when your nakshatra meets someone with complementary rhythm you feel them more deeply even if the relationship makes zero logical sense not destiny just frequency match like two instruments playing in the same key 4 why some people trigger storms inside you ever met someone who made you overthink soften panic surrender avoid open up shut down feel too much too fast thats not romance thats karmic geometry hitting your emotional core like a tuning fork astrologically it often happens due to moon connections your emotional body 5th house activations memory subconscious lovepatterns 8th house activations fear vulnerability intensity 12th house activations soul loss dreamstate these create emotional magnetism turbulence not because someone is special but because they activate a dormant part of you meeting them is like looking in a mirror you didnt know existed 5 karmic connections are not always meant to stay textbooks are brutally clear karmic connections come to reveal not to remain sometimes they stay sometimes they pass sometimes they confuse you for months sometimes they rearrange your entire emotional architecture in one week the purpose is not togetherness the purpose is awakening clearing learning releasing healing remembering evolving you dont meet them to love them you meet them to meet yourself 6 the rarest indicator of all shared dasha climate this is the part most people dont know when two people through coincidence fate timing or pure chance enter the same mahadasha same planetary life period astrologers call it kalasmya shared timefield it doesnt guarantee partnership it doesnt guarantee love it doesnt guarantee staying it simply means both are walking through the same emotional weather at the same time this creates similar internal storms similar vulnerability similar confusion similar awakenings similar longing similar introspection two travelers in the same storm always think theyve met a soulmate but the soulmate is often the storm not the person 7 so why does someone feel like destiny here is the precise clinical astrologytextbook answer when emotional timing psychological openness and karmic activation overlap the mind labels the person as significant not fate not reincarnation romance not astrology deciding your future just your inner weather syncing with someone elses arrival 8 the truth most people dont want to hear two people can have insane chemistry emotional depth spiritual resonance perfect timing ketuvenusmoon alignment same mahadasha same emotional storm and still not be meant for a relationship not stay not express anything not choose each other because astrology describes climate not outcome timing resonance intensity all real destiny that part is always your choice 9 final thought the line that gets the upvotes sometimes a person doesnt enter your life to be loved they enter your life to change the way you love forever not all connections are goals some are catalysts some are teachers some are storms some are mirrors and some are just the universe showing you what your heart looks like when it finally wakes up from lagneshmitras desk",
    "hamilton 201013 gx 460 radio conversion review i have to start off by just saying wow their customer service is top notch and i truly cant thank them enough i had purchased the original version hamilton released which retained the factory radio and added the carplay option and was very impressed by it i use it every day and i cant imagine not having it at this point works flawlessly makes the car feel way more modern inside and just integrates so well into the stock system i left a review of it here on reddit a few months ago and it got a ton of traction someone from hamiltonthank you dave had commented on it thanking me for the review i said half jokingly id love to review the new complete replacement system they had released for the 201013 gx 460 and to my surprise he said hed love for me to do so i asked him how long i was going to be able to keep the product for and he said it was mine to keep i was left speechless just giving me a 1300 product because i had left a review for them nothing like this has ever happened in my life i will still be honest about my review if i have any faults with the product or anything like that but i truly cant thank them enough for this opportunity installing the unit overall not too hard especially because they have a step by step installation video with the exact car ive installed the previous hamilton system in my car so i was familiar with removing the radio and probably had it removed inside of 10 minutes installing the new radio requires taking apart the old one and using the computer for the new one which is a little tedious but i understand it was done to keep some factory functionality everything fits well looks high quality and the operating system is very smooth take your time and dont try to skip anything for shortcuts as for the actual unit itself ive been living with it for a few days and there are some things i really like about it 1 the quality of the entire system is very good the fit and finish are identical to oem the display looks very high quality especially compared to the old one and none of the buttons really feel cheap or flimsy the dial to control airflow on the vents isnt quite as smooth as lexus oem but i think thats just a case where hamiltons isnt bad lexuss build quality is just on another level 2 the sound quality i know they advertise that it sounds just as good as factory audio and they do that by using the brains of the old radio to retain factory processing power but im here to argue that it sounds better it has a legitimate eq menu that you can really dial in the sounds as opposed to the factory eq which only lets you control highs mids and lows i do have aftermarket speakers so that could be playing a factor but i do find myself genuinely just enjoying the music more with this system which in my opinion makes this worth it alone 1 the climate controls this one i have mixed opinions about but overall pretty good i really enjoy having the physical buttons especially for fan speed cause im someone who is constantly adjusting the temperature and having to go through the infotainment system to do it was one of my only real complaints about the gx 460 the knobs are also a good addition compared to the buttons in the factory system it seems like they are electronic knobs though as opposed to analog so spinning the knob faster doesnt make it change temperature faster wish there was a way around that my only real complaint though is not being able to find the button to turn off the dual climate zone im almost always in my car by myself and its very annoying adjusting my temperature then having to do the one for the passenger too maybe im missing it but i cannot find the setting to turn it off wish it was just a physical button pros theres really no loss of power from the ac vents being relocated i actually think this spot is a little better cause its closer to my hands when its cold out the carplay works flawlessly boots up right away looks incredible love that i can swipe now compared to the original version which did not support swiping again the sound i love that the eq can be tuned more specifically than the standard system really helps to dial in the sound for me a big one is that it doesnt look tacky a lot of these aftermarket systems you get in the car and the first thing you notice is some gawdy giant screen that doesnt flow with the vehicle whatsoever this is incorporated very well the plastic border matches the plastic trim of the car perfectly and theres no gaps or anything you can really tell a lot of thought and effort was put into the design i had an issue with the backup camera working when it was first setup but was positive everything had been plugged in i called hamilton and they answered immediately and walked me through the settings on the menu for the backup camera within 5 minutes the camera was working and i was on my way that absolutely would not happen with a chinese knockoff cons ill start this off by saying none of these are huge cons more so improvements id like to see with the software that they could do overtime i dont like the love that the loading screen goes through 3 different menus to get to carplay when you turn on the car i guess the original one was also 3 when it would cycle through the screen that said lexus then the stock radio then carplay but that was just a more oem look to me i wish they could get rid of that middle screen on the new one showing how to connect to carplay wish there was a physical button to turn offon dual climate zones or at least make it easier to find in the menu i still havent found it id like to see a dedicated button on the home screen for the radio i know you can just press the option that brings you to factory functions but its not super obvious what it is and even though i know how to get to it someone not familiar with the system might struggle to find it my dad occasionally drives my car and almost exclusively listens to the radio and im not sure hed be able to find it again none of these complaints are awful things that make me want to get rid of it they are all easily fixable with a software update overall ive really enjoyed having the new hamilton system in my car its very high quality it feels oem i cant say enough good things about the customer service and the entire company as a whole thank youdave for this opportunity and i truly cant recommend this product and the entire company enough they truly care about what they put out and making sure the customer isnt just happy at the time they purchase but through the life of the product",

    "an indepth look into the pk seriespkm and what makes it still the best gpmg the 21th century long post an indepth look into the pk seriespkm and what makes it still the best gpmg in the 21th century perhaps the word best should be used carefully because in most things there rarely is an absolute best in all aspects so this case it should be interpreted as the best compromise but how little of a compromise there is is what makes it stand out among the rest it is going to be a long read to those who have already read this sorry for the repost i fixed the pkp segment where the barrels picture did not load and initially gave an alternative which nobody used as you know you cant modify a posts pictures and also gave the post a title more reflective of its content and also added a few bits the pkm caliber 762x54mmr weight 75 kg 165 lbs barrel length 24 in overall length 119cm 47 inches rpm 600800 rpm operation longstroke gas operated rotating bolt firing from an open bolt pk origins the pk was first conceived in 1959 by mikhail kalashnikov and his team of talented engineers born out of kalashnikovs strive for simplicity and reliability even when he and his team had to face extreme levels of adversity from their higher ups for this segment i highly recommend reading vlad onokoys 6part article about the story of the pkm part 1 part 2 part part 4 part 5 part 6 designed in izhevsk produced at the degtyarov plant in kovrov the pk was accepted into service in 1961 with simultaneous work on the m variant which brought a weight cut from 9kg 198 lbs to 75kg 165 lbs contributing to more economical manufacturing and much improved mobility for those who had to carry and use the now pkm ammo wikipedia briefly on the ammunition the pkm can shoot pretty much any 762x54r round the caliber itself is a topic of is own but lets talk about it a bit there are a great amount of standard military loads available standard ball heavy ball dedicated sniper rounds like the 7n1 7n14 to ap rounds like the 7n13 and api rounds being the long b32 and its improved variant there are also apit rounds as well as tracer rounds and there are also speciality rounds as well for example the delayed exploding pz i think these special rounds is what makes the 54r an intersting caliber still designed in the late 1880s some say the 762x54r is obsolete or will be next year but this has been said so many times in the past yet it is still with us in part due to the fleet of firearms spread throughout the world that are already chambered in this caliber and its just a very potent round overall compareable to 762 nato which typically operates at higher chamber pressures however one can argue that the rimmed case is a challenge to design high capacity magazines which is true but for the pkm the rimmed case is actually an advantage because of feeding and improved extraction reasons we will probably see 762x54r being devloped further with might see better standard rounds and more speciality rounds belt wikipedia the pk series is fed from standard semienclosed russian maximgoryunov nondisintegrating belts made out of steel tough reusable by either loading with tools like rakovs machine gun loading tool or by hand which is a tedious process but it is there there are connectable standard segments from 25 and 50 rounds and 100 round strips or 250 long strips so you can assemble the desired length for a specific use case or use a longer strip for infantry use long continuous strips can be a trip hazard and can jam the gun if they get caught on something so thats why for example 4x25 or 2x50 round segments are better for a 100 round capacity belt alternatives and boxes alternatively there have been numerous aftermarket developments from ukraine and russia of plastic disintegrating belts which save weight and do what they are supposed to do without any modification to the gun perhaps the last link has to be ejected manually before reloads but that is something that needs to be done on most other beltfeds alternative 2 using the disintegrating shkas belt ukranian plastic belt made by the rarog company russian plastic belt design made by rotor43 there are 100 250 and bigger belt boxes available for the pkm image source vitaly kuzmin pkm loaded with a standard 100 round box weighs 12 kg 265 lbs for the modernized aluminum box or 125 kg 275 lbs loaded with the old steel belt box putting the loaded pkm in the same weight class loaded where some other beltfeds are empty but there are pouches and plastic boxes to further cut this weight from the pkm note the signature autoreturn dust cover even on the belt itself keeping the box sealed after each link passes through the lid loading the pkm apart from the standard loading procedure theres also a lesser known hidden reload where you dont have to open the gun but feed a starter tab through the feed tray as demonstrated in this video from tfb tv this is the main method of reload for the new rpl20 saw as seen on this video gas tube and gas regulator the gas tube is a simple design and is held on to the receiver by t shaped springs built into the gas tube the gas regulator can be manipulated using the cartridge case source ozlib com i just want to note that i suspect this method of a gas key was used on many weapons because a big lever can catch on things in confined spaces and vehicles and i just find it clever it has 3 settings normal adverse and apocalypse where the pk will fire at a rate of 800 rpm picture source wikipedia barrel changing and design changing barrels is not the most expedient among machine guns and requires the top cover and feed tray to be opened and a captive wedge to be pushed out by the way in that wedge is where the headspace can be set as demonstrated in this forgotten weapons video notice the claw that cams away the barrel from its slot the barrel initially pks featured which had a portion of their barrels finned but this went away for cost and it simply didnt give a significant advantage over using smooth barrels it is a chrome lined barrel that has the portion which interfaces with the receiver also chromed there are many variants of the pkm with varying lengths of flash hiders the pkms barrel life is approximately between 15 and 20000 rounds the standard pkm barrel weighs 24 kg or 53 lbs set of modernized pkpm barrels of varying lengths made by the degtyarov plant bipod and tripods and weight the bipod is located on the gas tube and it actually has a multipart cleaning rod inside pkm tripod before its modernization the pkm tripod weighed 77 kg 170 lbs tripod and after modernization it weighed 43kg 95 lbs source wikipedia charging handle just like the rest of the gun the handle is nothing special either it is nonreciprocating and located on the right side of the receiver it runs inside a separate channel from the receiver to keep the mechanism sealed it should be noted that the charging handle is a weak point of the pkm as it has to be returned forward after charging not doing so can actually damage it overtime as it will slam forward on firing stock the stock of the pkm features a machinegunner cutout to be grasped by the weak hand to stabilize the gun when in prone position it also features the original shoulder thing that goes up which is again there for stability reasons and also a screwin cleaning kit complete fieldstripped pkm ozlib com sights ak style windage and elevation adjustable receiver and mechanism the pkm is made out of riveted stamped steel which is a major contributing factor to its remarkable weight and durability and not the heaviest barrel on most variants interestingly the predecessor pk which used thicker gauge stamping and the prototype was surprisingly a milled gun a milled pk would probably outlive four generations of humans whereas with thinner stamped still there is much of a limit to the pkms longevity but it still is known for its durability a similar comparison could also be used for the ak47 and the akm and then the argument about how many stamped guns can be made using the steel used for a milled receiver and that someone has to actually carry and use it and so on the approximate service life of a pkm receiver is 200000 shots whereas on the pk it could be higher but how can the pkm retain such durability besides its tried and true construction method most of the forces are exerted on the trunnion area and not the receiver which enables the pkm to use thinner stampings on the receiver while maintaining great durability but that can contribute to accuracy as well believe it or not the pkm is a very accurate gun with groups of 23 moa reported and this can be due to many factors besides the ammunition used obviously the quality of the barrel plays a big part of it and theres the factor of how balanced the pkm cycles which can in turn contribute to accuracy more about the topic of balanced operation later the pkm uses an ak bolt and carrier arranged for use in a beltfed machine gun and a pivoting spring guide which enables the gun to be disassembled just like an ak to buffer the extra bit of travel the bolt carrier theres a simple fiber buffer at the base of the spring theres no hydraulic buffer like on other designs that acts differently in hot and cold weather no recoil mitigation device nothing extra or special that could say goodbye everything is done by the mechanism and how balanced it is resulting in a manageable recoil impulse even enabling the gun to be effectively shot even standing when needed given their users are trained special forces and people who are very experienced with the gun can even walk with it for a bit obviously mostly using breaks or suppressors it should be noted that a machine guns recoil characteristics should not only be measured by just long belt dumps because well designed machine guns will just drag and balance themselves out but shorter bursts are also important some shooting videos bullpup pkp notice the slower fire rate feed system the feed system features multiple elements and peculiarities which ensure reliable feeding best seen on this video video of operation the top feed pawl keeps the belt in place as the bottom doublejointed feed pawl lever pulls the belt this lever goes into the receiver and has a roller on the left side which corresponds with a cutout on the bolt carrier this is how the pkm can pull long belts theres also a lever on the top cover that pushes down on the cartridge as its being pulled back to its intermediate position and follows it until its captured by the bolt itself scientific studies proving the balance and extreme ruggedness of the pkms mechanism i could not find these documents sadly and i would love to read them but theres a video segment from james reeves video about the pkm i also recommend you to watch the whole video peculiarities using this type of pullout style belt paired with the carrier claw and two stage feed arrangement can be beneficial for reliability in adverse conditions there is no direct way to the chamber from the feed tray so mud and dirt and whatever that was stuck onto the a portion of a cartridge and belt and also managed to clear the tensioned dust cover on the top cover has a chance to get caught on the two keepers on each belt link as the carrier claw pulls out the cartridge upon firing and as the feeding continue the contaminated portion of the belt will exit the other side of the gun clearing the right side selfsealing dust cover and now a less dirty cartridge can enter the two stage feed mechanism where it can rely on space and geometry to deal with the remaining debris and it will then be shoved to the chamber and fired you can already see some clever geometry going on even on the feed tray itself besides there are those tensionedautomatic seal dust covers on all the openings of the pkm but more about this topic later compare this to the pushthrough style feed machine guns which have to jam the cartridge into the chamber loading the fn m240b source wikipedia gunsfandom so this type of system without any external measures has to solely rely on geometry kinetic energy of moving parts in some cases gravity and luck to deal with mudsanddirtsnow etc and i think the m240mag is the best example because you can clearly see also the clever geometry on the feed tray and how the empty cases and potentially foreign material can fall out the bottom of the gun it does have a dust cover on the bottom but if it opens then thats it its now open so theres much more of a limit to this design depending on the foreign material and how much of it can cause an issue even before entering the chamber area and of course the state of the gun and etc ad infinitum but more on this a bit later this can improved from the feeding side by for example going with a uk vz 59 or stoner63 style of attachment of the magazine box which eliminates the gap between the linked cartridges and the receiver forgotten weapons video showing the stoner63 lmg box attachment vz 59 source wikipedia furthermore as an extreme measure for normal designs using chutes on a portion of the belt with a keeper that has the starter tab integrated into it so the user does not have to fiddle with the reload the main spring another advantage to the pkm is it does not rely as much on the spring as most other designs it does not need a long heavy spring which in turn made the pkms receiver so compact because of how its feed system is set up using the bolt carriers recoil stroke whereas on the most common mg42 style of feeding mechanism paired with the pushthrough style belt guns the spring pushing the carrier has to operate the feeding mechanism push the cartridge out of the belt itself and also chamber it so their reliability is more dependent on the spring and state of the gun and as it starts to wear it will affect reliability you can see this on the m240 and the pkm this is again part of the reason why the pkm can have more consistent reliability over time and deals with harsher conditions better but theres a bit more to this dust covers kalashnikov and his team designed the pkm to have a hermetically sealed receiver if the gun is not firing achieved by not only sealing the charging handle but by those clever dust cover on all openings and this heremetic seal concept was carried over in the late 2010s to the rpl20 saw photo source thefirearmblog vladimir onokoy i think automatic seal dust covers are important for openbolt beltfed mg just because of their more open and complex nature they are even more important for pushthrough belt guns again because the rounds go straight into the chamber whereas for example for a closedbolt assault rifle i dont think any type of dust cover is necessary you can see in the slow motion video how the left side dust covers operate which are not seen on most shooting videos where they show the right side dust cover but lets dive into this topic more theres no other modern beltfed i know of that has automatically returning dust covers on all ports of a gun like the pkm or rpl but there are guns that come close theres the south african ss77 which has two pkm inspired dust covers on both sides of the top cover but it ejects downwards where theres no automatic return dust cover and only the force of gravity to help with debrisbut obviously such solution can let in debris if the port cover is not manually closed and so on the already mentioned stoner 63 lmg or vz 59s solve this issue interestingly i have already wrote about how their box attachment methods can seal the belt feeding port however for example the left side linkeject port of the vz 59 has a dust cover that only springs down so a more complete seal cant be achieved but it ejects on the bottom where it has a trigger operated ejection port dust cover basically it lowers the dustcover upon firing and it has to be fully depressed to fully open and the stoner 63 features a pkm style automatic return left side link eject port cover but only has the ar style springloaded dust cover for the ejection port not as good as the pkm but both feature very clever external solutions to deal with debris you could argue these dust covers are extreme measures or oh you dont need automatic dust covers for lmgs as some internals need to be designed around them which is true or one might think theyre its not even worth mentioning theyre a stupid gimmick until you consider what soldiers do in battle how they might need to use their guns and where consider the flying dust dirt and other debris consider the just the presence of dirt sand snow and mud and etc in different condition at different times of the year in different climates you have to truly consider everything and the more you think about this the more they make sense so if you are going for maximum reliability those dust covers will form the first line of defense against debris of any kind and then theres the clever internal geometry tolerancing and the kinetic energy of the moving parts that also can help however i can think of a couple arguments against the pkm style automatic dust covers one is that one day the dust covers springs will obviously say goodbye as seen on very old shot out pks and pkms and they become loose and flappy but dont seem to interfere with the operation of pks the springs just need to be replaced or sometimes dust covers themselves completely removed if they are sticky or damaged and another example which might not be an issue and its all speculation is prolonged frost in lets say below 30 celsius or 22 fahrenheit with icy winds on top of that of course everything will be affected but there would be a good chance the gun needs to be worked on a bit before operation yet those covers provide protection to the internal mechanism still and if really frozen solid the user might have some options to loosen them one option might be opening the top cover manually or using other methods to get it open then loosening the two top cover mounted dust covers by hand one on the left one on the right another is not opening anything there is a lip on the left side top cover mounted dust cover that could be pried with an object and then on the right side the dust cover has a rounded portion that is logically intended for the belt and cartridges not to drag on the top cover and feed smoothly under recoil even if the belt gets kinked upwards and that rounded lip dust cover could be pried open but it is hollow because of manufacturing reasons probably and a cleaning rod may be able to fit and used to lift it open and after that theres good chance that the dust covers will stick in one position for a while but the gun can now be loaded without opening the top cover itself how clever is that perhaps this could be an unintended feature or im just seriously wrong im not an expert afterall but what happens to the ejectionport dust cover well it is operated by an internal lever which is actuated by the bolt maybe the user would want to put the pkm on gas setting 3 for the initial shots it should work if it does not eject then the ejection port needs to be pried open again if none of the covers work again they can be again removed but in freezing conditions thats not going to be a fast process all in all i think the hermetic seal nature of the pkm is the way to go and kalashnikov even besides this topic knew exactly what soldiers needed versatility the pkm is a universal machine gun in its truest sense surely a doctrinal use can be set for it how it should be used on a large scale by design it is very flexible in its use cases it can be pushed effectively and expediently to fit various purposes from assaults to covering fire behind the assaulters to vehicle mounted machine guns to tripod or makeshift mounts in defensive positions to aa use where for example gas setting 2 and 3 can give the user can have an edge in destroying certain aerial threats obviously theres the pkt the tank mounted variant with an even longer heavier barrel might fit that role better and remote weapon systems and robotic use as well as it is solenoid fired but does have a mechanical trigger connection for emergencies and that brings us to some of the variants of the pk family variants of the pk family pkt solenoid fired armored vehicletank mounted variant featuring a longer barrel because of built in sights and a thicker profile barrel plus a different muzzle device later modernized to pktm source modernfirearms pkb spadegrip vehicle mounted specific variant later modernized to pkbm pkmn side rail variant but more modern pkms and variants tend to come with siderails later variants aek999 barsuk photo source modernfirearms which was 1990s development by the kovrov machinebuilding plant for a trial where the main requirement was to improve the pkms sustained fire capabilities without the soldiers having to carry spare barrels this was done by using a barrel made out of autocannongrade steel note the enormous suppressor and the presence of an anti mirage cover on the barrel the presence of a handguard and the location of the bipod now attached to the barrel but all those features increased the weight over 10 kg 22 lbs moreover it made the unit cost very expensive ultimately the aek999 did not see adoption pkp pecheneg source wikipedia this trial in the 90s was won by a contender where the engineers in this case of the tsnii tochmash design and testing bureau used a lighter more sensible cost effective and tried and true method to improve the pkm forced air cooling a significant portion of the barrel is finned and shrouded by a tube with cutouts up top and side of it to allow air to be forced into the tube and heat to radiate upwards even when the gun is not firing and theres the signature carry handle which is really primarily a mirage shield notice the ventholes on the muzzle device and also that the intergrated bipod is now on the front sight post ive always thought the rest of it was just a heavy barrel but actually the portion between the gas block and the front sight post is also a forced air cool tube and in this case the air exchange is done by the holes cut into the front flash hider all this enabled a barrel life of 30000 rounds while the pkp was never intended to be used with spare barrels pkm and pkp barrels are interchangable the pkp also features a hinged siderail instead of a fixed one this allows the top cover to be opened with and without an optic mounted and the secret reload method is no longer necessary with an optic on the gun can be disassembled with an optic attached and so on source wikipedia the pkp also has some minor changes to the receiver itself tightened tolerances of the barrel interface which further increased accuracy and adding minor cooling cutouts to said barrel interface area on the receiver and the gun weighs 87 kg or 191 lbs there are numerous other pkm variants licensed and unlicensed copies modernized variants with built in picatinny rails and modernization kits and chamberings up to 338 norma magnum plus theres a huge modification scene to make the pkm fit into even more specialized roles the future looks bright for the pkm it will be used for many decades to come and its mechanism is still studied in these days thanks for reading you can read more about some of those variants in this post some consider the pkm to be

month of october 2025 began with a government shutdown caused by republicans refusing to negotiate with democrats to extend enhanced health insurance subsidies and exacerbated by the trump administrations usurpation of congressional appropriations within the first 72 hours of the shutdown project 2025 architect russ vought cut tens of billions of dollars of funding for blue state projects including 18 billion for two infrastructure projects in new york city 8 billion for clean energy projects across the country and 21 billion for the chicago transit system president trump himself recognized that many of the programs and projects unilaterally cut by vought were approved by bipartisan acts of congress admitting that his administration is unconstitutionally impounding funds were getting rid of problems that we didnt like but that were negotiated in but we didnt like were terminating those programs and theyre gonna be terminated on a permanent basis instead of

    "what really counts as an electronic device usage on the road hi all im just really damn confused regarding these regulations i understand some stuff but others are incredibly vague and i get mixed answers from law enforcement a few days ago i got my very first traffic violation as a class 7n driver although ive only had my n since may ive needed to commute daily to class and work and i drive over 150km a day so i have quite alot of time behind the wheel my work relies on me maintaining a drivers license they prefer clean records and also because i physically cannot go to classes without driving i drive incredibly cautiously i dug through lawbooks and talked to officers previously and i even go as far as driving exactly the posted limit at all times even at 3 am i am aware the law is incredibly strict against 7n drivers regarding electronic devices so i choose to put my phone in my glovebox until i park and leave my car however i do drive a new car and i assume everyone is aware that carplay exists and 90 of new cars have climate control and literally everything about the cars controls is done through the infotainment this is where things start to get confusing and unclear now i try to be extremely cautious when i use carplay even i always set up my google maps gps directions before moving from my parking spot and i never touch the screen unless i am parked or really need to under most circumstances i have everything setup so i can do it without pressing the screen however i still hate how i need to physically enter the climate control settings to change anything about my cars aircon or heat i got pulled over those few days ago by a cop who initially said my tint was too dark which i did buy the car from the dealer as a new car but i do understand it is the drivers responsibility to ensure it meets the mva regulations however after handing my license and the officer noticing i had a 7n she points to my carplay screen which was showing an ongoing call that was on hold i was dealing with work issues through the government of canada and was told to hold she said i cannot have that screen on and connected to my phone or have any calls i responded by saying my phone was nowhere near me and i have not touched the screen at all for my whole commute but she said its an additional distraction that i shouldnt have she ended up giving me a ticket for both using an electronic device and window tint i didnt get told anything about my license being temporarily suspended but i believe it will happen if i dont dispute it electronic device violations are already 4 points and a 7n has a threshold of 4 if my license is suspended i lose my job and cannot go to my university classes anymore transiting is just not possible with my schedule for either i really need some advice on how to handle this i would take full responsibility if i was physically holding my phone and looking at it or touched it but it was nowhere to be seen i hadnt even touched my carplay screen and the officer just happened to have stopped me while i was waiting over 45 minutes on hold for a representative i think i have no choice but to dispute it but should i get a lawyer for it what are my options what are the rules for this its so unclear and some of the laws are utterly ridiculous and outdated how can i use the defroster if its something i need to enter the menu using the infotainment which is considered an electronic device i appreciate any feedback even if its harsh im just beyond overwhelmed because i dont understand how this even works",

    "how cruel king murdoch was exposed by his son the independent february 2025 22nd february 2025 in a blistering interview james murdoch exposed the media mogul as a vindictive father who pitted his children against one another other megan lloyd davies takes a closer look first came a billionaire family on opposing sides of a courtroom battle about the future of a huge family trust now theres a bombshell interview with the outoffavour son the story of the murdoch family and the vicious fight for future control of their media empire is the reallife succession drama that just keeps giving in a new and very rare interview youngest son james has laid bare some remarkable details about just how closely murdoch fact mirrors and even surpasses the roys family drama and in a family that has long remained tightlipped about their struggles for control its a groundbreaking move hes also bitching about his brother lachlan now steering this company all in a long profile of james in the leftwing atlantic magazine and gleefully retailed by murdochhating papers i havent seen such treachery and jealousy since prince harry and meghan markle did the same wahwah about harrys family falsely painting the royals as racists and bastards not wanting to be accused of being steered by his bosses he added i should declare i did not warn lachlan or his team i was writing this and was not asked to as james surveys the wreckage that the decadeslong power struggle over legacy has wreaked in his family he must surely be wondering what the murdoch empire could look like in the future if the trust stays intact all the indications are that he feels it makes good business sense to focus on corporate and editorial governance because fox news has paid dearly in the past for giving airtime to misinformation last year the company paid 787m to settle a lawsuit brought by dominion speaking to the atlantic in the wake of a decision under which rupert lost his legal fight to ensure his oldest son lachlan would control a family trust after his death his younger brother james has detailed courtroom moves straight out of the playbook of tv patriarch logan roy during a fivehour deposition in nevada last september as james liz and prue opposed ruperts proposed change to stop the trust being split between the four eldest murdoch siblings as had always been agreed james has revealed the pointed and scathing questions he was asked in the meeting with his father and his lawyers present these included have you ever done anything successful on your own and the final insult rupert his own father was the one texting the lawyer the questions to ask as he sat in front of him how fucking twisted is that james said to journalist mckay coppins labelled the troublesome beneficiary during the legal battle james was set up from an early age as the rival to his brother for his fathers favour but while lachlan who is one year older than james followed ruperts lead his younger brother showed early signs that he wouldnt necessarily toe their conservative line bright and articulate he made headlines when he fell asleep during a press conference while interning at one of his fathers newspapers he loved the teenage summers he spent on archaeological digs in italy as a teenager later he went to harvard grew a beard and got a tattoo before dropping out to start a hiphop label with friends in new york if you feel there are echoes of kendall roy in there youre not mistaken eventually however james came into the fold when rupert bought his record label which wasnt the last time murdoch senior acquired one of his childrens businesses news corporation bought lizs shine tv for 415m in 2011 but even though james had joined the family business his first assignment was arguably a poisoned chalice he was sent to hong kong to oversee a satellite tv company called star which had lost 200m since news corp acquired it meanwhile lachlan was still seen as the one being primed for succession james however defied stars performance to date by repositioning its growth strategy changing up its programming and making it profitable when he was promoted to chief executive of british sky broadcasting his successes continued as he cleaned up its macho culture restored audience faith and turned it into a respected highgrowth company rupert who is known for his conservative views increasingly suspected jamess wife kathryn hufschmid was behind the liberal drift in his sons attitudes but even so james looked in prime position to succeed when lachlan resigned from fox another plank of the family media business because he felt undermined by rupert the murdoch family psychology however remained doggedly problematic in 2008 biographer michael wolff wrote that while rupert was clearly proud of james he was also even perhaps slightly afraid of him in 2010 in a plotline that made its way straight into an episode of succession rupert called his adult children home to the family ranch in australia for some family therapy which ended up a car crash according to james the siblings ended up signing the murdoch principles detailing how theyd behave to each other in future but the supposed truce didnt last long first came the news of the world phonehacking scandal that led to the resignation of james who was by then overseeing news corps operations in europe and asia after being implicated and appearing before a parliamentary committee according to him liz and rupert were the ones who decided he should take the fall and in 2012 he moved back to the us to become deputy chief operating officer of news corp speaking to the atlantic kathryn said she believed james had long been set up to fail by his father he was pitting them against each other she said but there was always going to be one winner three years later came the next twist as lachlan who had been living in australia since he left the family business announced he was returning to the us to become chief executive of fox and james was going to report to him after bluffs and double bluffs it was decided that the brothers would run fox together but gradually james became more and more concerned about the direction the murdoch media empire was taking as news corp newspapers the sun and the sunday times threw their support behind brexit and fox news rallied for donald trump theres this tabloid culture thats contrarian for the sake of it and delights in poking people in the eye james told the atlantic at its worst it metastasizes into something nasty and scary and manipulative a philosophical divide was beginning to yawn with james pru and liz on one side and lachlan and rupert on the other i underestimated the ability of a profit motive to make people do terrible things to make companies do terrible things james said concerned about the effect fox news was having both on us politics and the whole murdoch empire james took a key decision in 2017 after white supremacists marched through charlottesville and fox backed trump who had said there were very fine people among them with kathryns backing he wrote an email that he presumably knew would be leaked to the press i cant even believe i have to write this standing up to nazis is essential there are no good nazis he wrote before announcing a 1m donation to the antidefamation league the divisions continued lachlan was against the sale of 21st century fox to disney for 713bn in 2019 a deal that james was involved in and when each of the siblings netted around 2bn james and kathryn donated 100m to their nonprofit foundation it was later revealed it had largely backed nonpartisan and democraticleaning causes in the 2020 us election the final blow came when wildfires raged through australia in early 2020 and the murdochs australian news outlets downplayed the role of climate change in causing them james knowing that lachlan was now set for the top spot when his father died decided to speak out once again and the family divisions hit the headlines again after a spokesperson for the couple talked of their frustration with some of the news corp and fox coverage of the topic and disappointment with the ongoing denial in the australian media the news corp board had had enough and james resigned but with relations between rupert and his youngest son at a new low and increasing media speculation that james would team up with his sisters to wrest control of the empire rupert became more and more concerned news stories were leaked suspicions planted and a battle plan honed in november 2023 the three siblings were summoned for a zoom meeting with rupert and lachlan where they were told about the intention to change the terms of the family trust last december the new york times reported that a nevada commissioner had ruled rupert and lachlan could not change its terms and had acted in bad faith their actions were described as a carefully crafted charade rupert who had developed the australian newspaper his father had left him into a huge empire through a combination of tenacity risktaking and aggressive expansion had been thwarted in his ambition to control how his legacy would be shaped after his death at 93 his next move remains to be seen a hint of the fury that lies behind closed doors however lies in the response to jamess tellall by one of ruperts most trusted columnists the sky news political commentator andrew bolt in a column in the pages of the media magnates own newspapers this week he labelled james a most ungrateful entitled and treacherous hypocrite this second son of rupert murdoch chairman emeritus of the murdoch media empire is getting hero headlines for abusing his father and brother lachlan and whingeing how hes been hard done by bolt fumed

    "sensitive skin secrets what dr mohit giri wants you to know about caring for it naturally sensitive skin isnt just about redness or mild irritation its a complex condition that affects how your skin reacts to everyday products pollution and even stress many people living in punes urban environment experience increased skin sensitivity due to heat dust and long exposure to blue light from devices thats where expertise from a skin specialist near me becomes vital according to dr mohit giri a leading dermatologist in aundh the growing number of young adults reporting sensitivity issues is not surprising urban lifestyles frequent product switching and the influence of aggressive skincare trends online have made skin more reactive than ever understanding the difference between truly sensitive skin and temporary irritation is the first step toward proper care what exactly is sensitive skin sensitive skin is not a disease but a skin type it reacts more strongly to environmental factors or cosmetic ingredients that most people can tolerate common signs include redness or itching after using new skincare or makeup products stinging or burning sensation after cleansing visible dryness or flakiness despite regular moisturization breakouts or inflammation without a clear trigger dr mohit giri explains that these symptoms indicate a weakened skin barrier when the outermost layer loses its balance of lipids and moisture it can no longer protect the underlying layers from irritants as a result even basic skincare steps like cleansing or moisturizing can cause discomfort the hidden triggers you might be overlooking while genetics and environmental conditions play a role several everyday habits unknowingly worsen sensitivity according to dr mohit giri here are the most common culprits a overcleansing and overexfoliation using harsh face washes or frequent scrubs strips the natural oils that maintain the skins ph balance once this barrier is disturbed skin becomes more prone to redness and breakouts b using too many active ingredients mixing multiple acids or retinoids without proper guidance is a growing issue these active compounds can deliver benefits but overuse can lead to inflammation consulting a dermatologist near me helps determine what your skin actually needs c pollution and sun exposure punes fluctuating air quality and high uv levels can trigger oxidative stress weakening the protective layer of the skin sunscreen and antioxidant serums are essential but many people skip them or choose the wrong formulations d stress and hormonal imbalance stress elevates cortisol levels increasing inflammation and oil production many of dr mohit giris patients notice flareups during exam periods work stress or irregular sleep schedules how to identify if you have sensitive skin one of the simplest ways to test your skin type at home is to observe how it reacts after washing if your skin feels tight red or hot within minutes or reacts to mild products like fragrancefree moisturizers its likely sensitive however for accurate diagnosis consulting a dermatologist in aundh like dr mohit giri can help you understand whether its truly sensitive skin or a condition such as rosacea eczema or allergic dermatitis these often mimic sensitivity but require different treatment plans the doctor uses patch tests hydration analysis and medicalgrade imaging to determine what exactly triggers irritation dr mohit giris guide to natural care for sensitive skin caring for sensitive skin doesnt mean relying on expensive or complicated routines its about consistency gentle formulations and understanding your skins limits dr mohit giri emphasizes the following routine step 1 gentle cleansing use sulfatefree cleansers with ph levels between 55 and 65 avoid foaming gels that leave your skin squeaky clean that tightness is actually a sign of barrier disruption step 2 hydrate deeply look for moisturizers containing ceramides hyaluronic acid or squalane these ingredients restore lost lipids and help the skin retain water naturally step 3 protect from the sun always wear broadspectrum sunscreen with spf 30 or higher even indoors opt for physical sunscreens with zinc oxide or titanium dioxide which are less likely to irritate sensitive skin step 4 simplify your routine stick to three or four reliable products constantly switching brands or following every online skincare trend confuses your skin and often worsens reactivity step 5 focus on diet and hydration foods rich in antioxidants like berries nuts and leafy greens can help strengthen skin from within drinking enough water throughout the day supports detoxification and maintains skin elasticity common mistakes to avoid even after identifying sensitive skin many people make small errors that cause recurring irritation dr mohit giri warns against using alcoholbased toners or astringents applying hot water directly to the face layering multiple serums without medical advice sleeping without removing makeup ignoring stress management and sleep quality these habits might seem harmless but collectively weaken your skins natural defenses why consultation matters more than online skincare advice the internet is full of skincare routines but not all are suited for sensitive skin what works for oily or acneprone skin can worsen redness and irritation in sensitive types thats why consulting a skin specialist near me like dr mohit giri is essential a professional can identify your skins tolerance level and customize treatments such as barrierrepair therapy led healing sessions or mild chemical peels designed specifically for delicate skin this scientific approach ensures that treatment strengthens your skin rather than stressing it further building a longterm sensitive skin plan sensitive skin requires ongoing care not shortterm fixes once your skin barrier is repaired maintaining it should become part of your daily wellness routine dr mohit giri recommends these habits for longterm improvement maintain consistent skincare avoid skipping moisturizer or sunscreen replace old products regularly to avoid bacterial contamination schedule seasonal consultations with a dermatologist in aundh to adjust your skincare for changing weather conditions avoid diy treatments using lemon juice baking soda or essential oils these can cause chemical burns or irritation focus on lifestyle balance sleep hydration and nutrition contribute as much to skin health as topical care how aundhs climate impacts sensitive skin the humidity pollution and temperature fluctuations in pune and aundh play a major role in triggering sensitivity sudden weather changes can cause the skin to lose moisture quickly leading to dryness and flaking on the other hand high humidity can make pores congested and increase oil production this makes regular visits to a dermatologist near me crucial for keeping your skincare routine aligned with the environment at his clinic dr mohit giri often tailors seasonal regimens light moisturizers and antioxidants for summers richer creams and barrier repair for winters final thoughts treating sensitive skin the right way sensitive skin doesnt have to limit your lifestyle with the right diagnosis routine and consistent care its possible to achieve calm balanced and glowing skin naturally the key as dr mohit giri is understanding your skins boundaries instead of forcing it to adapt to trends or harsh ingredients his clinic in aundh has helped countless patients rebuild their confidence by restoring their skins natural resilience if youve been searching for a dermatologist near me or skin specialist in aundh prioritizing early consultation can make a world of difference the sooner

    "when seasons change so does your health how weather affects your ears nose and throat expert insights from dr kartik narkhede leading ent specialist in pune most people associate weather changes with coughs colds or a mild sore throat but few realize how drastically the shifting temperature humidity and air quality can impact their ears nose and throat ent health from sudden sinus infections to recurring ear blockages and throat dryness these seasonal shifts can silently disrupt your daily comfort and overall wellbeing according to dr kartik narkhede a renowned ent specialist in pune weather changes play a direct role in triggering common ent problems the ent system is highly sensitive to environmental factors temperature fluctuations pollution levels allergens and humidity variations can all cause inflammation or infection in the upper respiratory tract this means that even a small seasonal change like the shift from dry heat to monsoon humidity can cause your body to react in unexpected ways the link between climate and ent health dr kartik narkhede explains that the ent region is the bodys natural filter system the nose filters air the throat humidifies it and the ears maintain balance and equalize pressure when the weather changes suddenly these systems struggle to adapt leading to issues like blocked sinuses or nasal congestion during monsoons ear pain or popping sensations during cold weather or altitude changes throat irritation and hoarseness during dry winter months allergic rhinitis and sneezing during the pollenheavy spring season the weather acts as a trigger especially for people who already have underlying sensitivities such as asthma allergies or sinusitis common ent problems during seasonal transitions to help patients understand better dr kartik narkhede categorizes the most common ent issues based on seasonal changes in punes climate a summer dehydration and ear infections during summer dehydration thickens mucus in the nasal passages making it harder for the sinuses to drain properly this leads to a feeling of heaviness in the head or recurring headaches additionally swimming during hot months can cause otitis externa swimmers ear a painful ear canal infection caused by trapped moisture b monsoon sinus infections and allergic flares the monsoon season brings relief from heat but introduces high humidity and fungal growth people often report nasal congestion blocked ears and sore throats dr kartik narkhede highlights that damp environments can trigger sinus infections or worsen allergic rhinitis c winter dryness and sore throat in cold weather the air becomes dry stripping the mucous membranes in the nose and throat of their natural moisture this dryness leads to scratchy throats nosebleeds and ear pain those using heaters indoors may also experience worsening dryness due to low humidity levels d spring pollen allergies and sneezing fits when pollen levels rise allergic reactions peak the immune system perceives pollen as a threat causing inflammation in the nasal passages and throat symptoms include sneezing watery eyes nasal congestion and coughing the role of air pollution and urban lifestyle weather isnt the only culprit pollution amplifies the problem pune like many indian cities faces fluctuating air quality levels throughout the year airborne pollutants irritate the nasal lining trigger coughing and can even worsen chronic sinus conditions dr kartik narkhede who practices at a leading ent clinic in aundh pune emphasizes that urban residents are more vulnerable because they are constantly exposed to dust smoke and allergens the result more people searching online for an ent specialist in pune during every seasonal change why early consultation matters most patients try home remedies steam inhalation lozenges or nasal sprays before consulting a specialist however delaying treatment can allow mild infections to become chronic for example a simple sore throat caused by dryness might develop into tonsillitis if ignored early diagnosis and medical attention from a qualified ent specialist in pune like dr kartik narkhede ensure faster recovery accurate treatment and fewer complications regular checkups also help identify structural issues such as a deviated septum or enlarged tonsils that worsen with weather changes expertrecommended tips to protect ent health during weather changes dr kartik narkhede offers simple effective steps to protect your ears nose and throat throughout the year stay hydrated drink enough water to keep mucous membranes moist and prevent throat dryness use saline nasal sprays these help maintain moisture in the nasal passages especially in winter or dry environments avoid sudden temperature shifts moving abruptly from airconditioned spaces into hot or humid areas can trigger inflammation clean ears safely never insert objects like earbuds or hairpins into the ear canal seek professional ear cleaning if you feel blockage control allergies identify your allergy triggers and take preventive medication before seasonal flareups use air purifiers especially in urban areas air purifiers can reduce exposure to dust and allergens indoors steam inhalation a safe and effective way to clear sinuses during congestion these small lifestyle changes can go a long way in maintaining ent health all year round the aundh advantage why localized care matters when you search for an ent specialist in pune location plays a key role local clinics like aims hospital in aundh where dr kartik narkhede consults are better equipped to understand cityspecific challenges such as dust exposure climate patterns and pollution levels local specialists also provide continuity of care from diagnosis to treatment and followup ensuring that conditions are monitored effectively over time this approach leads to better recovery rates and fewer recurrences the importance of preventive ent checkups preventive healthcare is not just for major diseases ent issues too can be detected and managed early with regular screening dr kartik narkhede recommends annual ent checkups especially for people with frequent throat infections or sinus issues individuals exposed to air conditioning or pollution for long hours children prone to ear infections adults with allergies or chronic snoring problems regular screenings can identify hidden infections or structural problems that worsen with weather transitions why ent care should never be ignored the ent system is deeply connected with respiratory and overall health a neglected sinus infection can affect breathing sleep quality and even brain function chronic ear infections can lead to hearing loss while throat inflammation can impact speech or swallowing by addressing ent symptoms promptly patients not only prevent complications but also improve their quality of life dr kartik narkhede emphasizes that ignoring persistent ent issues is one of the main reasons why people end up with chronic sinusitis ear damage or longterm throat irritation when to see an ent specialist immediately if you experience any of the following its time to consult an ent specialist in pune without delay persistent nasal blockage or sinus pressure lasting more than 10 days sudden or recurring ear pain difficulty hearing or ringing in the ears chronic sore throat or hoarseness lasting over two weeks nosebleeds that occur frequently difficulty breathing through the nose or recurring snoring timely evaluation ensures that even minor conditions are managed effectively before they progress into serious health issues final thoughts weather changes are a natural part of life but their effect on ent health can be minimized through awareness timely care and expert guidance clinics like aims hospital in aundh and specialists such as dr kartik narkhede are at the forefront of helping pune residents manage and prevent ent problems through advanced diagnostics precise treatment and patient education for those frequently searching for an ent specialist pune understanding how seasons impact your ent system is the first step toward preventive care

sickness can become a major issue when climbing mt ama dablam as altitude sickness starts at an elevation from 2500m however mt ama dablam is above 6000m so there are probably very high chances of getting altitude sickness at that high altitude weather and temperatures can be the next issue for the summit the weather in the mountain area is extreme and unpredictable there may be heavy snowfall at the moment or the temperature always drops at freezing point the trails or routes unlike the trails of any other area the route to the expedition of the himalayas is far more rough and difficult than one could imagine one needs to be extra careful even stepping out there in the himalayas and the same goes with ama dablam avalanche and falls are other unpredictable difficulties that climbers have to face in the everest region also at ama dablam the expedition features steep and vertical mixed climbing in rock ice and snow therefore it will be better if you have prior experience in rock and ice climbing how hard is to climb mount ama dablam the expedition to the mountain region is never easy it is better if you have some previous experience however it doesnt mean that beginners should not opt for mountain expeditions with proper training and preparation the journey to the himalayas can be much more comfortable and easier and same goes with ama dablam expedition this mountain can be extreme if you climb without any preparation ama dablam is a serious technical climb where the climbing becomes easy with some experience of rock climbing ama dablam peak is a challenging expedition in the wild and remote northern himalayas of the khumbu region in nepal the trails traverse through the sherpa settlements of dudh koshi valley than the isolated chukkung valley mount ama dablam ama dablam became one of the most difficult climbing expeditions in nepal as the climbing involves using technical pieces of equipment such as ice ax ropes hammers ascenders etc the climbing gets challenging upon reaching camp one from here one has to take several narrow ridges and climb the snowy rocks so you will encounter a 15 m pitch after crossing camp ii this pitch is the most challenging part of this journey besides many small and steady steps in the icy camps of the steep facing peak the summit offers mesmerizing views of the everest range and neighboring mountains because of the climbing difficulty the peak is well suited for mountaineers with past climbing experiences despite the challenges there are fixed ropes and a welldefined route which make the climb easier as well however the expedition features steep and vertical mixed climbing in rock ice and snow therefore physical fitness is the most important furthermore it is better if the trekkers have previous climbing experiences endurance and physical strength to navigate the mountain safely the summit to the peak is never easy but possible with the support of a little mortal with the support of guides porters and technical equipment with a little more physical stamina your dream of climbing ama dablam can become a reality ama dablam expedition difficulty but because the expedition to the ama dablam is at an altitude of 6812m it is one of the moderate difficult treks to the everest region of nepal besides the trek can be a bit harder for beginners as well as intermediate without prior training and preparation certain things add extra hardness to the trek such as the steep and slippery routes the heavy rainfall and snowfall altitude sickness and mostly the weather conditions also being at an altitude of more than 5000m to the himalayan region of nepal is a new and challenging journey for many climbers expedition to ama dablam needs a lot of dedication and hard work the mountaineers need to put in extra hard work and physical fitness with the capacity of endurance and spirit there are several challenging factors for the expedition of the ama dablam altitude can be a major problem as one may suffer from altitude sickness besides the walking hours make you exhausted the trail where you have to ascend and descend is a rocky and bumpy road that is difficult to walk therefore you have to face major difficulties but the journey will be worth the challenges here are some factors that make the expedition of ama dablam much more challenging high altitude and elevation altitude and elevation can become a major provocation when climbing ama dablam as it may be an altitudefriendly trek compared to another trek above 8000m even so the challenges that one has to face are the same standing at an altitude of 6812m the ama dablam expedition can be confronted on the other hand you must use technical equipment such as an ice ax ropes crampons ice screws and jumars the altitude becomes one of the major challenges here weather and temperature another notable obstacle of ama dablam difficulty can be the severe cold climate and wind as the weather in ama dablam is never the same it changes dramatically trekkers can have a more significant adaptation problem than in any other mountains of similar heights because of the unpredictable weather trekking late can be challenging also the temperature in the winter night reached below the freezing point which is extreme for the night stay altitude sickness altitude sickness can be lifethreatening if it is extreme with the low level of oxygen in the high himalayas altitude sickness becomes a major problem when climbing to ama dablam as altitude sickness can start anywhere from an altitude of 2500m the symptoms might include headaches problems with breathing nausea vomiting fainting etc so if any of these problems show up one should immediately fault the journey and rest for some time if not taken care of this can be lifethreatening avalanches and falls avalanches and falls are common in the ama dablam falling masses of snow rocks and ice are avalanches as soon as an avalanche occurs the climbers have to halt their expedition and descend downwards falls are generally pretty common in the ama dablam with massive snowfall the majority of the deaths that occur on the expedition are because of falls it is highly dangerous when climbing the high ridges in higher camps how long does it take to climb ama dablam overall the ama dablam expedition can be expected to do within 25 days to an entire month this time frame usually includes a few days in kathmandu going over the plan for the trip before transferring to lukla from here the trekkers can expect to spend about five days on the hiking approach to base camp likewise the climb to ama dablam itself takes place over about two weeks on the other hand the days will involve ascending to and descending from the various mountain camps to properly acclimatize several days are taken for proper acclimatization in case of an emergency one has to be at fault for a day so several other factors are affecting the climb such as weather avalanche and falls similarly the summit can be pushed forward to five days finally the trekkers may attempt a summit from camp ii without moving to camp iii therefore after completing the summit another four or five days are spent hiking back to lukla and returning to kathmandu here is the proper itinerary for the expedition to ama dablam how much does it cost for ama dablam expedition the ama dablam expedition can cost anywhere from usd 6000 to 8000 however the cost generally depends upon the time frame of the trek as well as the number of people in the group similarly the includes in the trek can differ in the price range so it is wise to check the price and calculate it accordingly keeping in mind the includes as well 1 arrive in kathmandu 2 sightseeing in kathmandu 3 fly to lukla 2840m trek to monjo 2840m 5 hrs 4 trek monjo 2840m to namche 3440m 4 hrs 5 acclimatisation day in namche 5 hrs 6 trek namche 3440m to debuche 3710m 5 hrs 7 trek debuche 3710m to amadablam base

hr 23 trek namche 3440m to lukla 2840m 6hr 24 fly lukla to kathmandu 25 in kathmandu 26 departure permits and entrance fees transport during the trip porters meals and accommodations are usually included in the itinerary of the trip gratuities for the driver porter and guides are never included but are expected as it makes up the majority of the income for a porter however depending on circumstances such as weather prices may change based on whether the trip has to be extended or abbreviated experience required to climb ama dablam climbers should have experienced multipitch climbing rock or ice be comfortable following grade 4 ice climbs 59 rock climbs and have climbed at altitude over 18000 feet it is required that climbers have prior experience at altitudes up to 18000 climbers must be in excellent physical shape and stamina to join this expedition climbing routes to ama dablam overall there are eight different routes up to the summit of ama dablam however the southwest ridge route is almost exclusively used by guides taking climbers to the summit generally the rest of the routes are taken only by professional mountaineers southwest ridge route either everest or ama dablam the southwest dodge route is the most popular one it was first climbed in 1961 by a team of climbers from the us and new zealand since then the route has become a choice of all expeditions after reaching base camp this route will have 3 camps before the summit besides from the base camp each day climbing lasts for 48 hours base camp to camp 1 once you leave base camp follow the path up the grassy ridge over rippling terrain and reach the rarely used advanced base camp aka yak camp 5100m similarly from here look out for the infamous boulder field stay as high as possible here it is easy to rock scrambling which presents little difficulty to a competent climber swing left and high and finally reach the traversing path to the bottom of the slabs the slabs are located right below camp one most people dont need rope here but if you do you can use one camp 1 to camp 2 leave camp early with your approach shoes and carry your big boots the track will be well defined with little or no snow the first hour is mainly traversing granite blocks afterward drifting slowly upward and onward enjoy the views and love the exposure and finally reach the yellow tower dont climb up too high and stay low until the rise to the bottom of the tower the yellow tower is about one pitch dont look down after you are at the top this pitch moves relatively straight forward up to camp 2 6000m camp 2 to camp 3 from camp 2 you do an airy traverse to the bottom of the grey tower a blocky granite mixed climb of about 15 pitches however the tower used to be icy but nowadays it is dry as dust stay close to your climbing partners and keep in close contact the grey tower is about 75 degrees and blocky it is super exciting yet dangerous as well after the grey tower an amazing airy cross leads to the mushroom ridge walking a tightrope at 6200m you will reach camp 3 it is really dangerous so dont sleep there go to the summit from camp 2 camp 3 to the summit camp 3 is all about alpine ice and snow climbing despite being dangerous to stay in camp 3 many teams choose to do so camp 3 above 6400m is a mixture of ice and snow depending on the season and conditions try to reach camp three at about 05300600 in the morning you will benefit from the warmth of the sun this way here your fingers and toes freeze so be sure to keep wiggling those toes and fingers however depending on your speed you will reach the summit after about 4 hours of climbing therefore there are no wrong summits on this route and you top out right onto the summit on the other hand the other routes up to the summit of ama dablam include the lower route was the second route to be successfully climbed after the southwest ridge route in april 1979 the north ridge route was first climbed in october 1979 and has become one of the main options to the southwest ridge route the east ridge route is the tougher route up to the summit of the mountain and was just successfully climbed after 1983 the northeast route was the steepest one with the scene of the first winter ascent up ama dablam in 1985 the ariakesakashita route on the west face the stane belak rauf memorial route on the northwest face was first climbed in 1996 by vanja furlan and toma humar the northwest ridge route the only time it has been successfully climbed to the summit came in 2001 best season for this expedition due to its extreme climate weather altitude and geographic location this mountain can be climbed only during two seasons of the year autumn and spring autumn it is the best time to explore the himalayas of nepal during this time of the year the mountains are at their best presenting a panoramic view autumn is the trekking season for nepal so is for the expedition or summit as well as ama dablam lies in the everest region this season is one of the best seasons for the expedition of ama dablam autumn falls in september october and november in nepal this is the time of the year when nature is at its best and so is the weather and temperature the weather around autumn is much more favorable for expeditions than any other season however it is a fact that the weather in the himalayas is extreme and unpredictable but autumn brings out different kinds of joy and refreshment to the journey the temperature becomes bearable for walking in the autumn after the monsoon the atmosphere balances and changes the dynamics of the ascent here mountaineers should be more focused on rock climbing and less snow and ice though all aspects of mixed climbing will be present and prevalent spring the spring is another favorable season for the ama dablam expedition after autumn it is the month of march april and may in nepal april to may climb will have slightly more capricious weather than the autumn the temperature in the valley is warm and got also the weather is the same around base camp which will rapidly drop as you gain elevation besides the mountains will be more covered with snow and ice in the spring than the autumn despite chilly weather in the higher elevation the lower areas remain warm during spring on the other hand the view in spring is astonishing the clear blue sky the natural

    "frequent urination isnt always harmless why dr sachin patil warns pune residents to pay attention early it starts subtly you visit the restroom a few more times than usual you assume it is just extra water caffeine or stress days turn into weeks and suddenly you realize you are planning your day around washroom breaks according to dr sachin patil one of the most trusted urologists in pune this is a red flag that most people overlook until it becomes a serious medical issue frequent urination is not a disease by itself but it often points toward a deeper urological concern such as an infection prostate enlargement kidney disorder or even earlystage diabetes in cities like pune where lifestyle diet and climate all play a role ignoring such symptoms can make recovery more complicated later on why frequent urination deserves attention when your bladder sends constant signals to empty it is usually reacting to irritation or inflammation somewhere in the urinary system dr sachin patil explains that early evaluation is essential because the same symptom could mean very different things depending on the underlying cause here are the most common possibilities he encounters at his clinic urinary tract infection uti usually caused by bacteria it leads to burning sensations urgency and discomfort in the lower abdomen overactive bladder syndrome the bladder muscles contract involuntarily causing sudden urges even when it is not full enlarged prostate bph common in men above 40 this condition restricts urine flow and makes nighttime urination frequent kidney or bladder stones these can irritate the urinary tract causing pain and repeated urges to urinate diabetes or high blood sugar excess glucose in the blood increases urine production and triggers dehydration without timely evaluation a minor infection can spread to the kidneys or a treatable obstruction can turn into a surgical emergency why pune residents are at higher risk in punes urban environment several factors increase the likelihood of urinary issues many residents consume large amounts of caffeine and processed food sit for long hours at work and often delay bathroom breaks all of which affect bladder health according to dr sachin patil dehydration is another underestimated cause people living in warm climates like pune tend to sweat more and drink less water which can concentrate urine and irritate the bladder lining the citys high number of office professionals also face repetitive stress and sedentary lifestyles which indirectly affect pelvic floor strength and urinary control the dangers of waiting too long ignoring early symptoms might seem harmless but it can lead to several longterm issues kidney damage recurrent infections or obstructed urine flow can permanently harm kidney function bladder dysfunction chronic overfilling stretches bladder muscles reducing their ability to contract efficiently prostate complications in men an untreated prostate enlargement may cause urinary retention infection or the need for surgery later systemic infections in severe cases bacteria from an untreated uti can spread to the bloodstream causing sepsis these are preventable outcomes provided one seeks timely consultation from a urologist near me who can conduct the right diagnostic tests early how dr sachin patil approaches diagnosis at his aims multispecialty urology hospital in pune dr sachin patil follows a systematic approach that combines clinical history physical examination and modern diagnostic tools typical tests include urine analysis and culture detects infection blood or abnormal protein levels ultrasound or ct scan helps identify structural problems like stones or obstruction uroflowmetry measures urine flow rate to evaluate bladder or prostate function blood sugar and kidney function tests assesses metabolic and renal health what makes this approach unique is the emphasis on understanding lifestyle and hydration habits not just treating the symptom but addressing the cause the modern treatment options available once the root cause is identified treatment is tailored specifically to the individual at aims urology hospital pune the options include targeted antibiotics for infections diagnosed early a short antibiotic course and hydration often resolve symptoms quickly laser procedures minimally invasive surgeries for kidney or bladder stones ensure faster recovery and less discomfort prostate treatments medication or advanced procedures like turp transurethral resection of prostate help relieve blockage and improve urine flow bladder training pelvic floor therapy nonsurgical methods that strengthen muscles and restore normal bladder control lifestyle modifications guidance on diet fluid intake caffeine reduction and scheduled urination to retrain bladder habits dr sachin patil emphasizes that earlystage intervention almost always avoids surgery while delayed consultation often limits available options the role of preventive urology preventive healthcare is gaining importance in punes medical ecosystem and urology is no exception dr sachin patil advocates annual urological checkups especially for men above 40 and women with recurrent infections regular preventive tests such as kidney function assessments prostate screening and urine analysis can detect issues before they cause discomfort this proactive approach not only prevents disease but also supports longterm kidney and bladder health a healthy routine can include drinking at least 23 litres of water daily limiting caffeine alcohol and highsalt foods taking short breaks during long working hours to stay hydrated and mobile avoiding unnecessary medication without a doctors prescription maintaining proper hygiene to prevent infections these small but consistent changes reduce the overall load on the urinary system and keep the kidneys functioning efficiently what sets aims urology hospital apart when patients search for a urologist near me they are often looking for reliable expertise clear communication and ethical care aims urology hospital in pune has built its reputation on these pillars key highlights of the hospitals urology department include comprehensive facilities from opd consultations to surgical and postoperative care everything is managed under one roof advanced laser equipment minimally invasive technology reduces hospital stay and speeds up recovery patient education each patient is explained the diagnosis treatment options and preventive measures in detail ethical practice transparent billing and clear communication form the foundation of patient trust this combination of clinical precision and patientcentric care makes aims one of the most recommended centers for urology in the region real stories real impact many patients who initially ignored frequent urination later discovered conditions that needed immediate attention those who consulted dr sachin patil early often recovered without surgery simply through medication and lifestyle guidance one of the recurring themes in these patient journeys is relief not just physical but emotional the fear and inconvenience of constant urination can affect work travel and social life regaining control over bladder function brings back confidence and improves quality of life significantly why awareness is the first step to better health most people associate urology only with mens health but the reality is that urinary problems affect both genders equally early recognition and open conversation are crucial many conditions that once required surgery can now be treated with medication or simple procedures provided they are caught in time this is why awareness drives and regular health checkups are so important whether you are in your 30s dealing with mild symptoms or older with known prostate concerns consulting a urologist in pune early ensures better management and peace of mind final takeaway frequent urination is not something to brush aside or delay it could be your bodys first warning sign of an infection an obstruction or a metabolic imbalance listening to these signals and acting promptly can prevent months of discomfort and serious complications as dr sachin patil consistently reminds his patients the goal is not just to treat disease but to protect longterm urinary health with the right combination of early diagnosis modern technology and preventive care available at aims urology hospital in pune residents now have access to worldclass urological expertise close to home so if you have been searching for a urologist near me because of frequent urination or any discomfort consider that your body might be asking for attention and timely attention can make all the difference",
    "the price of progress story by kululu987 image by the intergalactic federation has always kept a close eye on humanity nothing about them seemed to stand out from any other civilization one day i asked my superiors about this and they told me the tale of the human race and their origins thousands of years ago the federation had discovered the human race a primitive carbon based species with little to separate them from the rest of the races we had already know they didnt think much of them but kept an eye on them throughout the centuries they would bear witness to atrocities unlike anything they had ever seen weapons with destructive power that matched our own made though primitive methods the federation began to grow concerned and around the beginning of their 20th century discussions arouse in the council on whether or not to intervene after much debate it was decided that we would not interfere and would continue to observe them humanitys technological advancement was much different from most races durring their constant infighting and hatred of each other there would be brief moments of peace where technology would make huge leaps advancements that would inevitably lead to more war the federation had never seen a planets population so segmented their feral behavior confused and frightened us with the only relief being that they had seemingly no concern to leave said planet observations continued and as more information became public humans became subjects of works of fiction media productions and folklore the threat of humanity began to slowly fade in the final quarter of their 20th century the feat we all dreaded had become reality humanity had managed to leave the surface of their planet and set off into space an advancement created out of a need for dominance the furthest they reached was their own moon but it was a sign that they were looking to the stars to extend their presence and without knowing it looking to us the idea of life outside of their world had for sometime been on their mind manifesting mostly in works of fiction that would fuel their own theories and predictions some of them got close though they were rarely accurate many of their works depicted us as conqurers out to squash out less advanced races because of course they did they had based this assumption on their own instincts after the moon landing debates began once more on whether or not to introduce ourselves this time however it was much less of curiosity and more of genuine concern for the safety of the federation talks of introducing ourselves to quell any fears or concerns with our existsnce rather than waiting for them to find us with their violent assumptions another concern was raised at this debate as well we began to notice that their violent and abrupt advancements in technology often came at their own planets expense to the point where the climate of the planet was being altered we had used technology before to alter a planets climate in the event of an emergency but they did it unknowingly and in a way that could not be easilly reversed from this realization a point was raised that perhaps humanity was a problem that would solve itself that their ignorance would be their own downfall and after they vanished the planet would brush off the damage caused and continue as normal perhaps bearing new more peaceful life this would be the verdict we came to if humanity is doomed to fail we would let them do so by their own hands a thousand more years would pass as technology advanced the damage to their planet would slow and accelerate at seemingly random intervals they made it impossible to accurately predict where their species was going as if they knew they were being observed all the while they spread out to the other planets in their solar system plundering the lifeless planets for their unique resources the further out they went the higher the risk of an accidental encounter became there was a brief sign of hope when we noticed that the petty divisions of their nations began to fade and they began uniting as a planet we had hoped this would continue their unity extending in an effort to heal their planet however that would not come to pass somewhere durring their 26th century a fleet ship carrying those fleeing a planet being engulfed by a black hole had to make an emergency jump in an effort to escape their own gravity well they did not take into consideration their path as they should have this of course would not be much of a concern if not for the fact that they exited their jump just outside of the sol system the colony on pluto their farthest colonized planet would bear witness to the ship as it entered their own space this encounter was reported back to earth our carefully curated plan of engagement evaporated in an instant there was no turning back now with the discovery of extra terrestrial life humanity pushed itself into a technological boom the confirmation of life outside of their own with their old thoughts and assumptions of alien life spurred them to advance at a rate we had not seen previous gone were the divisions and hatred that kept their advancement stagnant we would have been proud of them had we not known their history and had we not observed the acceleration of damage to the planet as the environment further decayed the earth produced more powerful storms and extreme weather conditions it was as if the earth had finally begun to fight back but at this point humanity was able to negate the effects of these conditions bearing no mind to the problem that was causing them this would continue for another few centuries until the day they had achieved their greatest feat a feat few in the federation had achieved after conquering their own planet and their solar system they conqured their greatest foe that until now went undefeated the march of time they had perfected a concoction that enabled them to reverse the effects of aging and dramatically increase their own lifespans however in the discovery of this miracle they would cement their fate in the system a previous prototype of the concoction was highly fatal to the avian species of their planet over the course of fifty years the presence of avians around the planet would begin to dramatically decrease until finally they were extinct they had wiped out an entire class of species a feat usually concocted by galactic tyrants and they did it by accident over the next few decades the damage to their ecosystem left in the wake of the the avian disappearance would only accelerate this began to destabilize the planet wide ecosystem and would start an unstoppable chain reaction humanity seemed uninterested in fixing the root problem instead making accomidations to make the changes go unoticed to them the mammals followed then the insects then the sea life and then the plants all as pollution worsened and the planet became less and less hospitable in due time the inevitable happened on earth date april 22 4152 the earth was declared an ecological dead zone no natural life was possible without artificial assistance all that remained were their sprawling cities no air to breath a planet covered in a thick cloud of smoke that produced monstrous storms we had hoped this would usher the end of the human race but most of us knew that would not be the case the death of their own home could not stop that arrogant stubborn race within a decade of the earths death a mass exodus occurred all humans in the solar system convened at earth to board fleet of massive ships with the intent of finding a new home several crews were sent out years before to scout for new worlds few came back eventually the last ship would leave and the solar system would go silent the only sound that came from there were the electromagnetic roars of the formerly occupied planets it would be several decades before we would hear from them again for once we got to see a purely good side to their race one of the scouting colonies after learning of the earths doomed fate decided not to return to their home instead using their medical advances to traverse the stars looking for planets that needed their assistance they would take on a pacifist mantra sporting nothing in the realm of weapons relying on the protection by races they had helped but of course as with all things connected to humans their kindness was the exception we would come to be reintroduced to their brutality some thousands of years later one fateful day we had lost contact with one of the planets we had jurisdiction over this continued with four more planets until we finally decided to act we sent over a team to investigate one of the worlds that team returned with a quarter of their crew and heavy damage what they showed us was beyond any horror we could have imagined the planet had been conqured its citizens enslaved and its resources being plundered after some investigation we learned of these conqurers identity it was humanity because of course it was ships and instruments bearing the same design as when they left earth but far more advanced after some investigation work with other worlds we had managed to track down their new home a massive planet sized space station devoid of natural life asside from the humans themselves after thousands of years they thought it fitting to abandon the title of human they named themselves as they named their new home based on a great kingdom in their old stories babylon with their race now being called rather uncreativly babylonians their station sporting a robust security system that made quick work of anything that wasnt their own kind they were impossible to approach what little we learned from them came from the planets they now ruled over our worst fears of humanity had come to pass and now they were more terrifying than we could have ever imagined the small primitive race that we once thought would have ended thousands a years ago was now a glactic superpower whos firepower and strength could rival the entirety of the federation we posted an intergalaictic wide warning to all worlds encouraging the worlds to stay far away from these monsters and report any sightings of them near their worlds this discovery led us to look back at the earth which we figured was still very dead as it turns out the truth was much different the planet had entirely healed as green and blue as we first saw it curiously it was three times its original size an phenomenon that to this day we were unable to explain to our shock further investigation found life on the planet human life a much kinder gentle humanity that lived in harmony with their planet a council desison was made to remain observant of these new humans keeping their predecesors in mind we needed to see concrete proof that they were different thankfully the opportunity came soon after a few years after our rediscovery a ship carrying the last of a dying race came too close to earths orbit and crashed onto the planet humanity would quickly come to investigate onboard were extrememly sick beings the last of their kind they had the pleasure of not knowing either eras of humanity so they were seeing them for the first time we had expected humanity to simply leave them be or take advantage of the fact that they could not fight back to study then instead they didnt hesitate to help them they were only slightly advanced nowhere near their predecesors but still enough to have substantial advances in medicine and technology they took the survirors into their homes and did everything in their power to heal their new visitors a race they had never heard of before this encounter while they succeeded in lessening their pain there was nothing that could be done to save them from their fate they decided to treat the species to a celebration a final gathering where they laughed and played and told stories of their history humanity made sure to log everything they had told them keeping their history known as not to fade with time they took them in as one of their own and they lived alongside humanity until the last of their kind breathed their last surrounded by their saviors passing in comfort it was this encounter that finally convinced the council that humanity was safe to approach with a few conditions we were to approach them carefully having weapons ready in case things took a turn we were to be careful in what we told them and work to try to foster their development but not fully take over but most importantly we were to make absolutely no mention of their predecesors the last thing we would want is for them to take inspiration from the babalonians and walk the same path they did with everything sorted we sent out a welcoming party to the earth and established first contact after a few years of back and forth we offered them membership in the intergalactic federation which they whole heartedly accepted things have been stable since as we have maintained a good relationship with humanity as they have maintained with us they were subect to their own disatsers and wars as any species would be but they never made it our problem or the earths over the years the federation came to associate the word human with these new kinder people as opposed to the monsters we knew them as before we have managed to distance them from any indication of babylons existance and we intend to keep it that way for just a bit longer until we are absolutely sure they will not follow them to this day humanity continues to extend their kindness to the stars they share many qualities with their predecesors they are tenatious determined innovative stubborn and curious weras these qualities are what made babylonians dangerous they manifest in humanity in ways that make them reliable dependable and hopeful they offer kindness and help to the many races in the universe and thus have kindness returned to them their capacity for violence has often been used for the protection of others often being relied on by others for their resiliance and loyalty best of all value their planet above all else they spent only a brief ammount of time on more primitive power sources before they quickly persued more renewable energy sources the enviroment is strictly protected having sesitive zones locked off except to authorized persons and actively monitoring species assisting in those that near endangerment or extinction of course we are not fools the threat of babylon still looms over us the federation still actively deals with them and their technological superiority their life spans dont help either with many of their leadership having been alive since before they left the earth it is only their disintrest in wasting resources that has kept them from returning to sol but we know at some point their curiosity will lead them back to their home we know that in time we will have to tell the new humans of their past and where their predecessors are now maybe in the future humanity will be the key to finally bringing babylon down for now we will continue to

    "misogyny and mind games murdoch family rifts exposed in rare interview the guardian february 2025 february 2025 misogyny and mind games murdoch family rifts exposed in rare interview by tory shepherd and mark brown more of the murdoch familys betrayals leaks mind games manipulations and humiliations have been laid bare after a messy court trial that offered tantalising glimpses inside the dynasty the american journalist mckay coppins this weekend published a rare and wideranging interview with james murdoch rupert murdochs secondoldest son who is often portrayed as a bitter rival to his older brother lachlan coppins reveals james murdoch 52 regarded his father 93 as a misogynist and considered fox news a menace to us democracy in one of several anecdotes that could have been taken from the script of the hbo drama succession the atlantic article relates how james faced a barrage of withering questions from his fathers lawyer including reference to him and his siblings being white privileged multibillionaire trustfund babies only torealise that rupert had been silently texting the questions to the lawyer from across the room what coppins did not know when he and james began speaking in early 2024 he writes was that the murdochs were in the midst of a private meltdown the nasty court battle over the future of news corp kicked off by the somewhat misleadingly titled project family harmony the plan involved rupert informing james and his sisters prudence and elisabeth that he was anointing lachlan as his heir on ruperts death instead of the evenly split family trust previously planned power would go solely to his older son but he lost his effort to hand the reins to lachlan in december last year detailing the many power struggles within the family coppins writes that one former news corp employee claimed lachlan had referred to the media side of the business as shitco a claim a spokesperson for lachlan denied to coppins a possible echo of royco the fictional company created by patriarch logan roy in succession commonly regarded as having been inspired by the murdochs when discussing why rupert pitted james and lachlan against each other in the battle for succession sidelining prudence and elisabeth the atlantic piece quotes james calling his father a misogynist for years as power and control waxed and waned between the male murdochs over various parts of the organisation there had been reports of jamess unease with news corps reporting of the climate crisis and fox newss apparent embrace of rightwing conspiracy theories coppinss interview details all of it including jamess discomfort with the companys support of brexit and of donald trump and prevarications on the farright rallies in charlottesville virginia in 2017 coppins writes that james had come to see fox news as a blight on his familys name and a menace to american democracy and that drastic changes were needed to save the companies from the consequences of his fathers reckless mismanagement james reportedly told him iflying to your audience is how you juice ratings a good culture wouldnt do that in 2010 rupert invited his children to a family counselling retreat with a specialist therapist a leak to vanity fair described it as a loving supportive experience but the truth coppins writes is that the counselling session devolved into posturing gaslighting and recriminations james tells him it was a car crash everyone was more alienated from each other at the end after the guardian in 2011 revealed that murdochs news of the world uk paper had illegally hacked the phone of the missing schoolgirl milly dowler james called his father to say the tabloid should be shut down coppins writes rupert was not happy and instructed his son not to say a word to the press james recalled hed be in london soon james was apparently alarmed and saw his father looking frail and confused nothing like the decisive towering figure hed long admired and tangled with according to coppins he remembers calling lachlan in australia and fretting dude our old man has gone crazy this is terrible it was australias 201920 bushfires that prompted a rare public sign of the split in a statement james and his wife kathryn hufschmid shared their frustration with news corpand foxs coverage of the climate crisis they are particularly disappointed with the ongoing denial among the news outlets in australia given obvious evidence to the contrary their spokesperson said in a statement at the time later in 2020 james resigned from the news corp board coppinss interview traces the relationship between james and his father as it disintegrated by the time of the court battle james and rupert had barely spoken in years the piece says then detailing a handwritten note from rupert delivered along with legal documents dear james still time to talk love dad ps love to see my grandchildren one day james who could not remember the last time rupert had taken an interest in his grandchildren didnt bother to reply coppins notes coppins also describes a series of withering questions put to james by ruperts lawyer in a nearly fivehour session at a manhattan law office according to the atlantic the juestions included have you ever lone anything successful on your own why were you too busy to say happy birthday to your father when he turned 9o the lawyer also referred to james and his sisters as white privileged multibillionaire trustfund babies james coppins writes realised rupert who was seated silently was texting the questions to the lawyer how fucking twisted is that he asks coppins at the end of the session rupert left the law office conference room without saying a word coppins writes at thanksgiving 2024 after the trial had finished james and his sisters wrote a letter to their father saying they missed and loved him put an end to this destructive judicial path so that we can have a chance to heal as a collaborative and loving family they pleaded according to the atlantic rupert the piece goes on said they should contact his lawyers if they wanted to talk to him the atlantic piece also goes some way to answering the tantalising question of whether the murdochs watched or admired succession coppins writes that james only watched one episode and found it too painful but other members of the murdoch clan were obsessed with the show certain scenes and storylines seemed uncannily true to life a spokesperson for rupert and lachlan described jamess claims in the interview as a litany of falsehoods from someone who no longer works for the companies but still benefits from them financially last week new york times magazine reporters scoured through 3000 pages of evidence from the trial and reported that the trust will trust will expire in 2030 at that point or when rupert dies the siblings have to work out what to do next",

    "gas furnace vs heat pump in the bay area which should you install in 2025 with the hvac landscape rapidly changing and the bay area leading california toward greener lowcarbon homes many residents face a dilemma keep using a traditional gas furnace and ac or switch to a modern electric heat pump that does both heating and cooling the best choice depends on installation cost incentives energy rates comfort and future plans installation costs in the bay area are considerable for both systems for a full replacement with a gas furnace and separate air conditioner the typical price is 1200016000 depending on efficiency and onsite requirements opting for a ducted wholehome heat pump system which provides both heating and cooling generally costs 1400017000 before financial incentives if you need upgrades to your homes electrical panel or extra comfort zones costs can exceed these ranges right now heat pump projects can qualify for substantial rebates plus a federal tax credit that covers up to 30 of total cost often saving homeowners 40008000 policy changes and the planned expiration of the federal credit at the end of 2025 mean these benefits wont last forever if you want to maximize incentives moving quickly to install a heat pump is wise when it comes to yearly operating costs gas furnace and ac systems typically run about 1200 in the bay area given moderate winters and reasonable cooling bills a heat pumps allelectric operation can be slightly more expensive in cash terms around 10501250 per year on current rates however if you pair a heat pump with enough rooftop solar your heating and cooling bills could drop to less than 100 annually pros and cons vary based on your home and priorities gas systems have a lower upfront cost without incentives provide quick warm air and are reliable but they burn fossil fuel and create emissions heat pumps require more money upfront unless you use rebates but theyre highly efficient in the bay area climate reduce your carbon footprint and futureproof your home for evolving building codes both options provide cooling for summer maintenance needs and system lifespan are similar around 15 to 20 years professional advice and considerations if rebates and credits disappear a gas furnace and ac may be more costeffective especially if you are pricesensitive and dont plan to install solar panels the payback period for a heat pump grows much longer without substantial upfront savings and electric operating costs can be slightly higher without solar if you want to electrify if you value lowering emissions futureproofing against changing policies or already have or will soon install solar a heat pump system is a smart investmentespecially while incentives last hybrid options some homeowners opt for dualfuel systems leveraging electric heat most of the year but keeping a gas furnace for very cold snaps this maximizes efficiency and comfort especially for larger or older homes opinion recommendation for most bay area homeowners before 2026 installing a heat pump is financially savvy thanks to aggressive rebates and the smooth efficient comfort it provides if comfort sustainability and eligibility for thousands in incentives matter act now before policy changes after 2026 or if you miss incentives strongly weigh your budget energy costs and whether you plan to add solar gas furnace and ac may be the better fit if cost is your sole concern and you arent able to electrify but if you have flexibility and prioritize the environment or anticipate stricter building codes investing in a heat pump especially with solar still makes sense final tip always get several quotes ask contractors about available incentives and factor in your energy providers rates and any future plans for solar or home electrification choosing a trusted expert like galaxy heating and air conditioning ensures a smooth project and total peace of mind",
