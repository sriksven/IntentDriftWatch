    "he xiaopeng we will definitely sell more robots than cars in ten years question why does xpeng insist on making highly anthropomorphic robots highly anthropomorphic robots require extremely high investment costs how does xpeng make trade offs he xiaopeng i believe that in the future high level robots will come in different forms but anthropomorphic robots have three major advantages first for a robot to be intelligent it cannot rely on rules but must be ai driven and the most data can be learned from the human world second most scenarios in the world such as homes and factories are designed built and operated for human use the more anthropomorphic a robot is the easier it is to adapt to the world third from a purchasing perspective anthropomorphic robots are more likely to make people feel a sense of affinity which means they may sell well higher sales volume can lead to economies of scale and with scale costs will be lower forming a positive cycle question what is the reuse ratio of components between xpengs new generation robots and cars he xiaopeng i dont have an exact answer but many processes are the same for example perception and domain controllers and 70 of the ai software is the same however the joints and skin of robots are not found in automotive components question what proportion does xpeng hope the revenue from the physical ai business will account for in the total automotive revenue he xiaopeng the global automotive market is worth trillions of dollars with 90 million cars produced annually i personally think that the robot market will be worth 20 trillion dollars but this may take 10 to 20 years and wont happen overnight the development of the automotive industry often follows a relatively low growth linear curve because it is closely related to strict safety regulations and policies however once robots pass the technological and product inflection point they will experience extremely rapid growth i havent thought about how many robots we can sell in a year ten years from now but i believe it should definitely exceed the number of cars question many robotaxi companies havent made a profit yet how does xpeng motors ensure profitability when promoting its robotaxi plan how is its business model different from other robotaxi companies and how do you view the competition with them he xiaopeng xpeng may be a different kind of robotaxi company we have mass produced cars with pre installed systems our thinking is not technology first instead we consider whether what we do has commercial value user value whether it can reach a technological inflection point and whether the government and society will accept it xpeng will also launch robo intelligent driving version models for consumer sales which can significantly share the bom cost a key cost component in the product design procurement manufacturing and assembly processes of automotive manufacturers and r d expenses in addition xpengs robotaxi and xpeng cars can share bom and r d expenses giving us a natural advantage of tens of percent or even several times over other companies in these two aspects moreover we dont need high definition maps street scanning or lidar we think more like a person in the physical world so our technology has broader applicability and generalization and there is no need for deployment costs i firmly believe that in the future four wheeled vehicles will be a combination of shared and private use i dont think all cars will become robotaxis in this case xpeng chooses to provide a toolbox for robotaxi including cars software and sdk interfaces we open up our capabilities and partners from different countries and regions can buy our robotaxis for operation question why did xpeng choose to cooperate with autonavi for a global ecological partnership for its robotaxi first he xiaopeng first autonavi was previously under my management its my former employer second autonavi is a very large travel ecosystem platform in china so it operates and we provide the toolbox i think this aligns with the strategic positioning of both companies question xpeng mentioned at the press conference that it will launch three robotaxi models next year what are the differences among these three models he xiaopeng they are priced differently we have different robotaxi models at different price points to meet the needs of different users there are also 7 seat 6 seat and 5 seat versions for now this is all i can disclose these three models support different robotaxi requirements question why didnt the press conference mention l3 and directly aimed at l4 is the progress of l3 products stuck due to laws and regulations he xiaopeng i believe that in the future there will only be l2 and l4 no l3 because l3 is neither l2 nor l4 question has xpengs second generation vla vision language action really completely removed the l or has it been converted into other forms of tokens he xiaopeng ours is v l we didnt convert it into human language and format but into a new language for the physical world its not a language that humans can see and recognize but its very efficient and more comprehensive second it can be decoded in the middle and we can completely deduce the intermediate process for example we can figure out why it should have turned left but didnt weve achieved this in the evaluation of the physical world model question at the xpeng motors technology day press conference physical ai was applied to different carriers what other ideas do you have for the application scenarios and carriers of physical ai in the future also as the sino us technological competition intensifies which side do you think has more development advantages in the field of physical ai he xiaopeng companies that develop earlier will have a greater advantage today in physical ai the first mover advantage is very important which was not seen in the past physical world or on earth in the future data will be the most important guarantee weve seen that the progress of many large model companies in the digital world has slowed down in recent months i believe the root cause is not the algorithm the model the computing power or the electricity but the data in the field of physical ai i think everyone has a chance the core is who can do it well first and who has good engineering capabilities good engineering capabilities mean good implementation and after implementation good user experience and better service are needed to form a huge cycle this is also why xpeng has never fully believed that simply making a car bigger more beautiful cheaper and of higher quality can lead to victory these are only necessary conditions not sufficient ones it is important to do a good job in hardware which is the foundation but software also needs to be well developed thats why i talked about physical ai for nearly two hours at the technology day how to organically combine the physical world and the digital world to meet customer experience i believe is just the beginning of the emergence of physical ai question tesla is also exploring flying cars recently tesla and xpeng may be the two companies with the highest business overlap in the world so what is the biggest difference between xpeng and tesla he xiaopeng both tesla and xpeng have found a way to cross domain innovation by changing dimensions for example when applying vla to robots the original robots used reinforcement learning for the foot joints it was the optimal solution for the previous technology but its not good enough for the new technology i dont know exactly how tesla is developing flying cars but i think both are crossing boundaries by changing dimensions tesla conducts self research on machines but promotes integrated innovation across domains let me share with you the vlt vision language taskthinking of robots once the robots brain matures well apply it to the next generation cars youll see that countless new logics will converge at a certain point which will be really interesting gu hongdi i think there are two points worth noting when comparing tesla with us one is the similarity neither of us focuses on a very narrow niche but aims for mass production scale the difference is that xpengs ecosystem is very open which is different from tesla",

next steps for qimc qimc reported a key permitting milestone in qubec july 23 2025 and has stated it is preparing to present drill targets for nova scotia nov 13 2025 nova scotia as of november 7th 2025 qimc has now identified drill targets to be revealed at the conference in nova scotia next week offtakes as spoken about in live videos as well as in our road map for ai data centres as well as for ammonia in q4 2025 and q1 2026 new board appointments qimc announced the creation of an advisory board for its ai data centre strategy this ties into the vertically integrated ai data centre model with their natural hydrogen energy model since midseptember 2025 qimc has signalled a strategic shift from pure exploration to integrated project development announcing an ai datacentre strategy powered by its natural hydrogen discoveries and forming an external advisory board to accelerate implementation the company is preparing to present defined drill targets at the nova scotia mining

fault zone this is a major crustal structure in nova scotia the geology includes sedimentary covers horton group etc and structural complexity faults reactivation that may help generate and allow migration of hydrogen exploration expansion qmet and qimc are continuing together in the region with qmet recently closing the first tranche of their private placement with the second to be closed shortly qimc has expanded its land claims in nova scotia especially around west advocate phases 34 are now in play looks to finalize offtakes all four zones in ns have had sampling results released qimc now has their announcement of drilling targets to come shortly qmet will also be looking to drill in the present quarter in tandem with qi recent work in the cumberland basin produced another major discovery sept 22 2025 with peak soilgas values up to 4125 ppm h and multiple samples over 1000 ppm supporting the companys characterization of nova scotia as a districtscale hydrogen system and forming the basis of nearterm drill targeting significance implications the hydrogen concentrations are unusually high for soilgas in eastern canada the 5558 ppm measurement in west advocate is especially notable the size of the anomalies multikilometre scale in multiple zones suggests this isnt just isolated pockets but part of a more extensive hydrogen system geological fault zones seem to play a critical role in enabling or concentrating the hydrogen that points to potential predictability areas along these faults are good exploration targets ontario qimc and dmed have sampling done on their ontario properties dmed with the inrs and qimc have a program with 2000 soil gas samples to identify natural hydrogen zones this is on the geological continuation of qimcs stbrunodeguiges asset the results of the sampling program have come out with 454 samples analyzed 55 above 500 ppm 19 samples over 2000 ppm and a high of 2817 ppm hydrogen h2 these lines cover 453 km as part of our commitment to sustainable regional development we are also advancing discussions with the tmiscamingue first nation on establishing an ai data infrastructure project powered by offgrid natural hydrogen energy said john karagiannidis president ceo of qimc united states minnesota in minnesota through orvian qimc secured a 1600acre land package it is close in proximity to koloma one other consideration is that qimc were unsolicitedly invited by officials from minnesota to come out and discuss land the ministry has 12 million acres at its disposal and now qimc can narrow it down to the ones that fit the geological profile that the company is aiming for and expand in the us thanks to strong government support qimc also announced an agreement through their spv orvian in tandem with rggs land and minerals ltd owned by russell gordy through this collaboration qimc looks to expand their clean hydrogen initiatives qimc since my last article has now announced that through orvian they have secured a large area in the mesabi iron range 12000 acres qimc continues to expand geographically and strategically since late summer 2025 the company has secured us acreage through orvian including a large 12000acre package announced sept 15 2025 while also continuing discovery work across qubec nova scotia and ontario positioning itself as both a natural hydrogen explorer and a potential energy supplier for offgrid infrastructure projects now in minnesota recent developments with the government revealed some information regarding the legislation for extraction there are some concerns over the extraction of the hydrogen in the us regarding fracking concerns this is something that would be bypassed in collaboration with dmeds technology however in this article this was stated to not be a concern and would result in progression before legislation passes in late 2026early 2027 minnesota would not be gas extraction in the traditional sense like a static reservoir geologic h2 isnt that it is a dynamic system from source rocks things in minnesota for qimc are moving forward with the mnr and the state that is the portion of the technology coming to play with integration into the iron ore formations such as those in the mesabi iron range as highlighted in this and in the article provided above everything is on track as governments get on board with natural hydrogen houston this conference is meant for qimc to engage with international partners industry leaders and stakeholders in the hydrogen space this will help raise awareness to the ongoings of qimc a lot of very serious players will be involved at this conference black tree energy group qimc entered a partnership to bring their expertise to the us in march and develop natural hydrogen projects there culminating in an orvian project one in every state qimc for their part are now able to capitalize on bteg connections for financing and other benefits for their expansion news to follow in this space below the writeup contains old information from quebec nova scotia and ontario next steps the processes that qimc have used for sampling and those for next steps align with scientific processes to be or that have been used with marc richerlafleches theories on the hydrogen now it is no longer a test on whether there is hydrogen it is a question of how much hydrogen there is hydrogen is a dynamic underground system with constantly flowing hydrogen due to the timing of the year this is the time when the next steps are drilling advancing on our land in the us and the continuation of work on nova scotia ontario and quebec land qimc is also doing work in the land of companies such as qmet matane and nova scotia and dmed ontario with dmed technology having the ability to be deployed in the us qimc will be looking to drilling in nova scotia after the conference in november with the targets announcement pending industry contacts as a nascent industry qimc have a relationship with avalio ran by vitaly vidavsky and nikolay larin they are experts with years of experience working on natural hydrogen and qimc can benefit from that working relationship pricing resources natural hydrogen is a lowcost resource to exploit at a cost as low as 080 per kg for extraction and selling at about 10 per kg as gold hydrogen has recently discovered there are possibilities of helium in the grounds where the hydrogen is found the team at qimc will be exploring the opportunity for their helium on their property sells for about 50kg determining natural hydrogen from the news release dated september 11th the tectonic zone of the graben appears to have been active since more than 546 ma as evidenced by the emplacement of alkaline magmatism represented regionally by numerous carbonatites eg sthonor carbonatite niobec mine but also by lamprophyres and kimberlites gittins et al 1975 notes prof richerlafleche the grabens normal faults were subsequently reactivated between 200 and 250 ma during the triassic and early jurassic tremblay et al 2013 the graben still exhibits neotectonic activity as evidenced by the magnitude of the earthquake that struck the saguenaylac stjean region in 1988 in addition states professor richerlafleche in the western and southwestern parts of lac stjean normal graben faults cut large volumes of potassic granitic and syenitic rocks as well as mafic intrusive rocks associated with the lac stjean anorthositic complex potassic rocks which are also rich in actinides are potential sources for the production of hydrogen by radiolytic processes importance of soil samples and at the right timetemperature no false positives for qi materials soil samples are key to any hydrogen project and false positives need to be ruled out something qi materials does not have a problem with some hydrogen exploration companies are looking for h2 in old oil or gas wells and have issues with anthropogenic values where the corrosion of wells creates hydrogen other hydrogen exploration companies have false positives coming from biogeneration caused by the soil type whereby bacteria could break up and produce hydrogen in qi materials case existence of unique geological settings has been modeled which enables hydrogen to be generated by geochemical reactions deep in the underground where water geochemically reacts with specific type of basement rock that is rich in iron potassium radon etc taking out the o from the h20 and generating hydrogen which then seeps up to the surface through seismic faults that are now being explored as qimcs highest ppm measurements read over 21000 ppm at subzero temperatures this gives indications that the numbers are higher now and at deeper depths the company has also received support from local first nations and they have aided the company in their drilling efforts not just in quebec but in nova scotia as well news releases since sept12 2025 qimc orvian secures 12000acre minnesota package sept 15

funds leaving the company in a good position to not need massive dilution to get their end goal this presents a unique opportunity as the inrs are part of it insiders are very committed and a ceo john karagiannidis and a team with the know how to bring qimc in the best direction at the time of writing the approximation on their other exploits quartzsilica pays for the market cap qimc has expanded their team recently with andre turmel fabrice consalvo sylvain boucher eric chouinard and peter wong andre is part of the comite executif for hydrogene quebec he has a proven track record widely recognized in canada being named lawyer of the year in both oil gas and natural resources 20242025 and earning a top ranking in energy law fabrice joined the board and brings in over 30 years of

technologies bringing insight into scaling up these ai projects peter is the economist development officer for the tmiscamingue first nation who will guide community and indigenous engagement as qimcs projects expand across the ontarioqubec hydrogen corridor new staked land qimc have secured more land since my last writeup with new claims in the cumberland basin which is strategically near ports and easier to distribute future thought qimc are now in their second stage there with more than 1000 samples collected in the area proflafleche and his team are looking to find the results of the sampling program to find hydrogen methane and carbon dioxide members from the temiscamingue first nations are also in this initiative dmed development john kargiannidis is now the president ceo and director of diagnamed given the government is strengthening their budgeting for hydrogen in the province this is a clever move with 30 million being put toward their initiatives qimc and dmed together can now look to advance the sector not just in ontario but the us too dmed are now exploring temiscamingue and will be continuing work with the inrs and qimc to move this program forward qimc now has the full temiscamingue district and now has the dmed technology history of quebec sampling based on the soil and geophysics anomalies they began deploying monitoring shallow wells these were placed in anomalous zones identified from lines electrical tomography up to 50 m deep in overburden quaternary sediments and shallow fractured rock some wells drilled into shallow monitoring holes to sample below the soil horizon and in shallow fractured rock one major result a shallow well got 7119 ppm h at 50 m depth with several other wells giving results in hundreds to a few thousands ppm started realtime monitoring of hydrogen flow at hot spots using shallow drilled holes 5 m with probes these are shallower than the 50 m wells intended to monitor dynamic gas flow and see temporal variations very shallow 5 m for flow monitoring plus continued monitoring wells at 50 m and increasing depths in some cases also using headspace gas and possibly dissolved hydrogen in water helps see how hydrogen concentration flow varies over time season temperature etc and starts to validate that accumulation is not just a soilorganic effect monitoring wells deeper sampling line wells etc also increasing depth of wells and increasing hydrogen concentration readings launching larger campaigns in quebec and other zones conclusion qimc represents an intriguing investment opportunity as the partnership with the inrs will reduce dilution as opposed to other options there is no foreseeable cash raise coming in the short mid or longterm future the drills as mentioned above are provided for exploration and provide a clear path to the next steps with a tight float held by insiders and long holding investors qimc has the potential pending more discovery to become more established continuation of work with the inrs will provide a clearer path to more findings and establishing reservoir sizes with proven scientific methods unique to those used in the past by others qimc has three prongs to their arsenal with interests in hydrogen silica and potential in helium insiders have been purchasing on the open market at all time highs this is not financial advice all of these are

    "leaving a bad survey just wondering if my frustrationdisappointment is warranted in this deal im contemplating sewering the dealership with the manufacturer survey we were looking for a sienna for a bit nearly impossible to find xses in alberta but halloween night this dealership calls me at like 6 and says someone backed out and the one i inquired about a few days ago was available he texted me the all inout the door price with all the extras so i asked if price is firm and he said no movement then he called and asked if he could put a 500 deposit on it for me which i was fine with we were going to buy it anyways i was gonna pay cash and we were going to go down the following friday to a concert since the city the van was at is a 5 hour drive one way they pushed and pushed that it would really help them out if i could come pick it up either tha coming saturday or sunday im assuming for some sort of month end so my wife and i figured out childcare over sunday so we could go pick it up a couple days later couldnt get money from tfsa into cheques soon enough to pay cash over the weekend so had to pivot and setup financing 7pm that night i do the credit app all went good and was approved in a few minutes i asked them to send me everything for insurance asap so i could get it done first thing saturday morning this is where the issues started 1 spent 4 hours off and on trying to get ahold of the salesman and finance guy saturday to get the info i needed for insurance they ignored calls sent texts theyd call back in a few minutes then nothing finally after a couple hours salesman texts me an offer to purchase paper that is 350 more than what he texted me last night i asked about the difference in price and he called me and said yeah uh i did my math wrong an its actually this price theres nothing we can do about it i said okay it is what it is only xse i can find so dont have a choice signed the offer to purchase right away 2 looked at my banking they charged me 1000 instead of 500 deposit end of the day doesnt really matter but they werent authorized to do that 3 finance guy refused to send a bos because we hadnt done the deal yet insurance would not send a pink card without bos i told him to send me everything over docusign he wouldnt they wanted to verify my identification in person before they would do any paperwork and he said that the price on the bos today probably wont match the final amount i said how does that work and he starts on about all the extras they offer for warranty and stuff i said not interested in any of that so lets get this done so i can get this info to my insurance he finally agreed went over the warranty on the vehicle the charges on it then gave me the biweekly payment i said okay whats the final amount financed then and it was 5000 higher than the salesman and i had agreed on i said how did that happen oh the extended electrical warranty to which i said i dont want any of that i told you that i want it for the out the door price the salesman gave me this morning he reluctantly removed it honestly think he was trying to screw me with that not once did he mention through any of the conversation with him that he was adding on an extended warranty for 5000 had i not asked him the final finance price he wouldve snuck it in there for sure by now it was 330 and insurance closes at 5 long story short finally at 415 he sent the bos to insurance finally meanwhile while this is all going on we are returning my wifes rental to another city 2 hours away that we used during the insurance claim they knew we needed that vehicle sunday because we were returning the rental saturday and they just dragged ass all day with the simplest thing just was way more stressful dealing with this than it needed to be i felt 4 told the salesman that when we came in wed like to be in and out as quick as possible nicely since its 10 hours of driving we still gotta pickup and kids etc get there sales manager comes over saying important the survey was to get perfect scores if i need anything please let him know basically wasted 15 minutes then finance guy takes us upstairs tries the whole series again of protections warranties etc wastes over another hour of our time when we already went over everything and told him we didnt want any of it the day before finally once its all said and done and salesman is showing us the van he goes oh i need to get you your second set of keys comes back and says oh so i guess you get your second set of keys when you send us proof of registration i just said okay i was just done with them at this point to me ive now bought the vehicle its my property give me why i paid for lol maybe im wrong ive bought a new truck every 612 months for the past 45 years not once have i never received both sets of keys been screwed around trying to get a bos had a price in writing that changed the next day had such a hard time getting answers or call backs from sales staff been charged more for the deposit than what was agreed on i was not rude or ignorant to any of them i didnt try to remove anything from their price sheet like the tire and rim protection their 700 platinum protection package which im still not sure what it even is lol so im just kind of surprised they were such a headache to deal with i just think the finance guy was a weasel salesman had no clue what he was doing really and it was by far the worst experience ive ever had buying a vehicle in my life if there was any other xse available in alberta i wouldve told the salesman to kick rocks as soon as he told me the vehicle was another 350 the next day and not given them another minute of my time but thats the problem with supply and demand i guess",

    "storm ability this ability set was inspired by an ability ive posted befpre this is an average hunter no stronger than shoot or knucle despite having experience in the field theyre still in training under their mentor assisting them with their hunts until he finds his specialty they are a gentle giant and transmuter with dual affinity in conjuration not considering themselves a fighter they created their abilities based on their love of clouds and a desire to protect rather than harm however they know conflict is inevitable so they only use their nen aggressively as a last resort flowing cloud ryun affinities transmutation the user transmutes their aura to mimic the properties of pressurized vapors making their aura either a soft cushion or forceful when it is allowed to build up pressure this allows their aura to behave like dense but soft pillows to soften incoming attacks or as steam to enhance the force behind their strikes the user can combine these properties to make cloudlike shields to shroud a target to protect them or pressurize their legs to jump higher or rush a target like a steam engine train their clouds can also be easily molded into any shape or size to more accurately touch a particular target rising tempest shten arashi affinities transmutation conjuration by sacrificing 50 of their current potential aura output all at once the user conjures a black hooded cloak around their body the cloak is 100 immune to electricity and acts as a condition that allows the user to add transmuted electricity to their flowing cloud the cloak lasts for sixty seconds noted by the hourglass designs on its chest and back gradually fading from top to bottom once sixty seconds are up the cloak disappears if the user wishes to reuse the cloak they must sacrifice an additional 50 of their potential aura output as a result this ability can only be safely used 35 times a day without sufficient rest if the users maximum aura potential is 20000 aura activating this ability cuts it down to 10000 and they lose the other 10000 they then can only access the 10000 aura they have left for any of their objectives background reflecting his views on conflict the user only uses this ability as a last resort reflected by the hefty cost of sacrificing half of their current aura pool to conjure it and put themselves on a strict timeline to finish the task perfect storm kanpekina arashi affinities transmutation perfect storm is a combination of flowing cloud and the electricity produced by rising storm when the user activates flowing cloud their aura now manifests as clouds charged with electricity the clouds act as a vehicle for the electricity allowing the user to focus on shaping the clouds to more accurately strike their intended target whenever the target is touched by this cloud the electricity forces their nerves to fire causing their body to be paralyzed for a few moments by diluting or concentrating their cloud aura the user can create either a numbing mist or a focused bolt of lightning to deal considerable damage",

the attributes below stats nen overall mastery of the 4 major principles and advanced techniques ryu ko ken and more sta staminaaura reserves the endurance to sustain prolonged physical or mental activity without fatigue str strength the raw physical power to deliver damage and to lift push or throw targets spd speed determines how quickly distances are covered and how fast movements are

fast controlled execution of complex movements reaction time agi spd per des ability to perceive and respond instantly players do not need to list these on their sheets they are naturally implied through stat distribution individual traits each oc may have up to 2 traits which represent strengths not covered by stats examples sword mastery charisma advanced gyo control skilled boxer proficiency in conjuration keen nose enhanced lung capacity etc each trait must include a brief description explaining what it does traits cant be overly broad or cover multiple skills for example master of all martial arts isnt allowed however creating a fighting style that incorporates elements from various martial arts without fully mastering each one is fine as long as its wellexplained weaknesses maximum of 1 weakness per oc having a weakness is optional but if a weakness is included the oc gains 5 additional stat points totaling 90 pts and 1 extra trait statbased weaknesses attributes rated 14 may be considered weaknesses players cant have more than one attribute rated below 5 points impact and coherence all weaknesses must have meaningful impact and align with the ocs concept examples blindness is only valid if it significantly affects combat performance similarly a stealthbased oc cant take loud as a weakness without strong justification battle relevance weaknesses will be actively explored by enemies during pvp encounters the level of exploitation will depend on how the weakness is defined and integrated into the oc in pve npcs may also target weaknesses but this isnt guaranteed prohibited weaknesses lack of training or experience eg cant use firearms mechanics directly tied to a hatsu eg must close eyes to activate the ability weaknesses must be logical and exploitable absurd or overly niche examples like fear of pink cotton candy arent allowed point allocation stats range from 1 to 10 whole numbers only only one stat may reach 10 none may be 0 total 85 points or 90 with a weakness stat levels 1 novice barely competent 23 beginner just starting still learning the basics 4 competent able to perform basic tasks with some consistency 5 average comparable to skilled midtier hunters like shoot knuckle and palm 67 skilled above average demonstrating refined technique and efficiency 89 expert highly refined skills consistently performing at an elite standard 10 master the pinnacle of the nca potential equipment equipment is optional carrying limit each oc may carry up to 6 distinct items quantities of the same object count as a single item eg 30 bullets 2 revolvers different items count individually eg revolver katana grenade always specify exact quantities eg 5 arrows 2 daggers allowed weapons mundane objects vehicles and trained animals prohibited militarygrade vehicles eg tanks jets mythical items or beings that grant powers eg divine script dragons animals extinct for over 100 years overpowered items eg nukes or any item that can end a match instantly description unique or modified items require a brief description eg weighted boots for strength training proficiency wear and loss players lacking the necessary traits to handle an item are considered competent lvl 4 such gear is prone to breaking being lost or stolen attributes like agility and intelligence help mitigate this however if an item is vital to your strategy investing in a related individual trait is strongly recommended hatsu nen abilities creativity is welcome but all abilities must follow nen logic and stay balanced ability limitations different abilities you may have up to 3 completely distinct abilities that are unrelated to one another eg pouf had 3 distinct abilities his unnamed hatsu to bestow nen abilities on others spiritual message and beelzebub shared element abilities you may create one ability with multiple variations as long as they share a common theme or element the total limit is 7 variations eg pokkles arrows tsubones vehicles kites random weapons highly versatile abilities you may design a single versatile ability with multiple applications provided they remain coherent and consistent eg hisokas bungee gum killuas electricity or morels smoke attention memory overload will be considered in this event overly complex or fragmented hatsus that diverge into unrelated effects may be rejected during review if you plan to develop multiple abilities it is strongly recommended to follow the shared element abilities format for coherence and balance prohibited overpowered abilities that can instantly end a match abilities that rely on conditions being fulfilled before the match begins or after it ends activation through lifethreatening conditions or use of postmortem nen abilities without strict conditions or techniques that grant excessive versatility without meaningful restrictions vows and conditions feedback process note oc reviews are handled in the review post anyone is welcome to review and give feedback on ocs if an oc seems unbalanced reviewers should tag the player with suggestions eg uterranoctis your stats are incorrectly allocated dont forget to tag the player players arent required to accept feedback but must justify their choices if questioned however if multiple reviewers suggest changes the player must implement them approve ocs by replying approved to the submission each oc must receive at least 2 approvals submission guidelines the oc sheet template and an example are located in the first comments of this post oc sheet template here formatted example just for reference the example sheet features hisoka here having trouble submitting your oc due to size limits if your sheet is too large for the comment box follow these steps 1 create a separate post on rhatsuvault with your hatsu 2 copy the link and paste it into your main submission oc sheet 3 remember player take care when formatting your sheet avoid submitting something

    "ielts writing task 2 band 7 need feedback before my test in 4 days hey rielts ive got my ielts in 4 days and want to make sure my task 2 essay is on point im aiming for band 7 and would love honest feedback on structure vocabulary coherence and task response write about the following topic both government investment in public transport systems and reductions in public transport ticket prices will help to reduce transport pollution greatly do you agree or disagree with this statement give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge and experience write at least 250 words the upgradation in the quality and standards of the local transportations by the authorities along with the subsequent reduction in the ticket costs will lead to the decrease in pollution levels this is true to some extent and i agree with this statement pollution levels especially in the metropolitan cities have increased drastically over the last 20 years one of the major factors behind this is the carbon emissions by the everincreasing numbers of private cars and motorcycles on the roads the governments are unable to accommodate the needs of the increasing population by providing good standard of public transportation systems so most of the citizens prefer their own private vehicles for comfort and convenience hence by lowering the costs and providing quality public transportation facilities administrations can convince the general public to change their method of transportation for their daily commute although i do think that this is a positive step in trying to reduce the pollution levels and i support this initiative however this alone will not be able to make a crucial impact on the environment the policymakers should increase the taxes on the import of petrolpowered vehicles to encourage the people to use the public transport instead apart from this the authorities should encourage the use of ecofriendly electric vehicles by abolishing the heavy duties on their import this will surely incline more people to buy electric cars and bikes lastly dedicated cycling tracks should be made for the cycle enthusiasts amsterdam has adapted this technique a long time ago and more people use cycles there than anywhere else making it a green city to conclude the allocation of funds to improve the public transportation and the reduction in traveling costs is a good initiative to counter the rising pollution levels but to really make a noticeable change some additional policies which are discussed in this essay are needed to be adapted as well 318 words",

    "removable fence ideas hey folks im looking for some removable fence ideas the situation the back portion of my property est size 150 x 100 has an easement from the power company for some power lines that run through there there are 20 or so houses on my street who also have easements on the back of their property so there is a long strip of open land running down the side of my neighborhood we arent allowed to put any kind of permanent structures on there because the power company has to be able to access the power lines and they come through every couple years to trim back trees before hurricane season the problem there are some idiots nearby who drive go carts four wheelers etc up and down the area under the power lines which makes sense because its a nice long empty fairly flat strip of land while i get the appeal of it i dont want anybody driving their murder mobiles on my property i dont want the liability if they get hurt additionally i would like to spread some native wildflower seeds back there in the spring so i dont want these fools messing up my habitat we have caught a couple of them and told them to stay off our property but theres only so much we can do to catch them were at the end of the easement properties so they are trespassing just long enough to turn their vehicles around and go the other way what kinds of things would yall consider putting up to block access knowing that the power company will occasionally come through and take it down im thinking the green plastic mesh fence might be the way to go with the green metal fence posts every few feet and put very visible no trespassing signs on it weve done smaller versions of that to protect rabbit warrens that occasionally show up in our backyard so our dogs dont kill the babies but nothing nearly as big do yall have any other recommendations edit the easement is 150 wide by 100 deep the power lines run longways through that portion the power company is georgia power and this is their exact wording about putting fences on easements in general a fence should be no taller than fifteen 15 feet the easement may require a shorter height a fence must not obstruct access to or along the rightofway and must be placed in a manner that will ensure proper minimum distances from georgia power facilities are maintained any fence that spans the rightofway must have a minimum sixteen 16 foot drivethrough gate installed with an appropriate georgia power padlock singlecable fencing is not acceptable for georgia power access fencing and gate locations should be clearly visible to georgia powers crews any fence built with conductive material should be effectively grounded and electric filters may be required on certain electric fences so we technically could put a permanent fence across the easement as long as there is a gate that provides an opening at least 16 wide and we have a padlock from georgia power if i am understanding that correctly also in the state of georgia the landowners are responsible for keeping property with an easement on it clear of debris and for any maintenance and we have to allow access to the easement at all times without notice",
