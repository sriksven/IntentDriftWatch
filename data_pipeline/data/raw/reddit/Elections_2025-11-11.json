    "can u guys pls read the first three chapters of my novel managing the store of the dead msd and tell me what you guys think i dont know if i should label as ya fantasy or adult fantasy btw i need an agent im done with my fantasy novel chapter 1 the job offer from beyond the air was freezing the kind of cold that just latched onto your bones and told you you were an idiot for even being out here the wind whipped around me on the rooftop cutting through my cheap jacket like it was nothing below the city lights blurred into a dizzying smear i wasnt admiring the view though i was too busy focusing on the hollowedout feeling in my chest that had become my permanent roommate this was it one step and it would all be over bit of a chill out tonight isnt it i nearly jumped out of my skin stumbling on the slippery gravel i whipped around heart hammering against my ribs standing a few feet behind me like he just popped out of nowhere was a guy in a charcoalgrey suit not just a suit a perfect suit the kind you only see on tv or in some fancy magazine he had this neatly trimmed goatee eyes that seemed to sparkle with a weird amusement and a smile that didnt quite reach them can i help you i snapped my voice rough i just wanted to be left alone the guy chuckled a soft dry sound maybe maybe i can help you david miller he took a step closer and i instinctively took one back there was something off about him not creepy exactly just other like he wasnt quite real how do you know my name i demanded i hadnt told anyone where i was going my anxiety was already through the roof no pun intended my dear fellow i know many things his smile stretched showing teeth that were almost unnaturally white lets just say ive got excellent intel and my intel tells me youre looking for a change of scenery a rather permanent one if im not mistaken he nodded subtly toward the roof my face felt hot i hated being caught like this exposed and pathetic thats none of your business on the contrary the guy said pulling a pristine white business card from his jacket he held it out its very much my business my name is mr e and i have a job offer for you i looked at the card it was thick embossed and completely blank no name no number just a faint shimmer that seemed to pulse i didnt take it a job i snorted a bitter laugh escaping me what you hiring for professional rooftopjumpers because i was about to apply mr e leaned in his voice dropping to this theatrical whisper better much much better im offering you a chance to manage a store a very unique store i might add one that caters to a very particular clientele what kind of store i asked despite myself a tiny spark of curiosity like a dying ember flickered in the darkness a store for the recently deceased mr miller mr e said like he was talking about the weather the dearly departed the nolongerliving whatever euphemism you prefer its retail just like any other but for spirits i just stared at him then i slowly backed away youre nuts a common misconception mr e replied completely unfazed but rest assured i am quite sane and quite serious my current manager just moved on bit of an unplanned sabbatical you understand and we need a replacement someone with an open mind and frankly someone who has nothing left to lose he looked right at me a silent jab so youre saying you want me to manage a store for ghosts i said a hysterical giggle trying to force its way out this had to be a dream or id finally broken precisely mr e clapped his hands together softly its a busy place very high demand youll be responsible for inventory customer service staffall the usual managerial stuff only you know with the occasional ectoplasmic stain or poltergeist incident thrown in and where is this store i asked my brain doing loopdeloops mr e waved a hand dismissively oh you wouldnt find it on any map its adjacent between worlds you might say very exclusive very convenient for those whove just checked out he winked why me i asked youre at a crossroads mr miller youre adrift you have a certain detachment that will serve you well plus youre clearly not afraid of the unknown considering what you were just contemplating mr e finally pushed the business card into my hand it felt cool smooth and pulsed faintly think of it as a fresh start a new life even one where your previous troubles are irrelevant i looked at the blank card then back at mr e his eyes had this weird knowing depth not threatening just powerful what did i have to lose my old life was already over one way or another this this offered something a distraction at the very least whats the pay i asked a sliver of my old cynical self poking through mr e grinned more than you could ever spend mr miller and a company apartment all expenses paid plus excellent benefits i thought about it for a long moment it was insane completely utterly insane but going back to my empty apartment to the suffocating weight of everything id screwed up felt even more insane okay i said the word feeling weird on my tongue okay ill take the job what do i do mr es smile widened he held out his hand and the air around it seemed to shimmer excellent just take my hand mr miller we have a lot to discuss and a store full of customers waiting i hesitated then took his hand it was surprisingly warm yet firm the world around me twisted the rooftop the city lights the night skyeverything just blurred into this crazy kaleidoscope of impossible colors a sickening lurch like falling forever then a sudden snap i was standing in what looked like the main lobby of a really old department store like from a blackandwhite movie ornate pillars marble floors and these high arched ceilings with dusty chandeliers but the customers there was a woman with a gaping hole in her chest calmly looking at some spectral scarves a dude with an arrow sticking out of his back was arguing with a glowing blue ghost behind a counter a headless knight was browsing a rack of what looked like shimmering armor and through it all there was this faint sweet smell of decay mixed with something like static electricity mr e beamed gesturing grandly welcome mr miller to the managing the store of the dead or msd for short your new home and your new life i just stared my mouth hanging open my suicidal thoughts were long gone replaced by this overwhelming mindbending absurdity one thought managed to get through what the hell have i gotten myself into chapter 2 retail hell literally my jaw was practically on the marble floor my brain which a few minutes ago was ready to check out permanently was now trying to reboot a headless knight a woman with a hole in her chest ghosts actual honesttogod ghosts and i was supposed to manage them speechless i see mr e chuckled tightening his grip on my arm slightly a purely human gesture that somehow felt out of place given the circumstances a common reaction but dont worry youll get used to it the msd has a way of normalizing the extraordinary he tugged me forward past the spectral scarfshopper the woman with a hole in her chest paused her ethereal gaze passing right through me and then went back to examining a shimmer that probably wasnt even there right then an orientation is in order mr e declared his voice cutting through the faint eerie hum of the store first things first your office my office already my head spun trying to keep up wait wait back up what is this place why am i here are you are they real mr e stopped turning to face me his perfectly trimmed goatee emphasizing a slight frown real my dear david thats a philosophical quagmire best left for your offhours what matters is that this place exists and you are here as for why i believe we covered that on the rooftop no you needed a new path i offered one a rather unique one admittedly he gestured around the vast echoing space this is the liminal emporium colloquially the store of the dead or msd for short we cater to those who find themselves between destinations between destinations i repeated my voice barely a whisper you mean like purgatory a rather archaic term but yes youre in the right ballpark mr e nodded a glint of amusement back in his eyes think of it as a very exclusive layover lounge spirits who arent quite ready to move on or perhaps have some unfinished business tend to linger here and like any good consumer they still have needs he continued walking and i stumbled after him my eyes wide we passed a section labeled in glowing ancient script memory lane souvenirs inside a translucent elderly woman was painstakingly polishing a display of what looked like shimmering fragments of light ah edith mr e called out meet david our new manager edith looked up a soft benevolent smile gracing her translucent lips oh hello dearie welcome to the msd dont mind the draft its just the constant passage of souls you know she giggled a sound like wind chimes need any help finding your way uh no i think i think im just getting started i stammered she looked so normal apart from being seethrough lovely lovely edith chirped going back to her polishing edith was a department store clerk for fifty years mr e explained as we moved on very dedicated found it hard to let go even after a rather unfortunate incident with a rogue escalator excellent with customer relations though my stomach churned rogue escalator this was getting wilder by the second we rounded a corner and the ambiance shifted this section had flickering lights and shelves stocked with what looked like dusty glowing artifacts a tall gaunt figure with sunken eyes and robes that seemed woven from shadow was meticulously rearranging a shelf of what he called echoes of regret and this david is barnaby mr e announced cheerfully our resident curator of existential dread he handles all things unresolved barnaby turned slowly his eyes like deep wells fixing on me he didnt smile another warm body for the meat grinder eh mr e lets hope this one lasts longer than the last he dissolved into a puddle of existential angst and glitter messy that barnaby play nice mr e chided but without any real sternness david is a fresh perspective and he has a very grounded approach to management he winked at me right i mumbled trying to avoid barnabys intense stare existential dread got it barnaby for all his macabre charm was a philosophy professor before a very aggressive paper airplane accident mr e whispered to me conspiratorially as we walked away he appreciates order even in chaos good man to have on your side if you can get past the gloom we finally arrived at a set of ornate double doors at the far end of the store they looked like something out of an old bank vault but made of dark polished wood mr e pushed one open with a flourish and here we are he announced ushering me inside the office was surprisingly mundane a large mahogany desk a leather armchair a few dusty bookshelves and a window that looked out onto nothing just an endless swirling mist cozy isnt it mr e said settling into the armchair behind the desk as if it were his own this is your command center david from here youll oversee the daily operations handle inventory manage staff and ensure customer satisfaction i walked over to the window peering into the swirling grey whats out there the void mr e replied simply dont worry about it its mostly harmless unless you fall in of course i quickly stepped away from the window right so what exactly am i selling here and who are these customers why do they need souvenirs or echoes of regret mr e leaned back a knowing smile playing on his lips excellent questions david thats the spirit of a true manager the msd provides whatever a lingering spirit believes it needs to finally find peace sometimes its a tangible object from their past recreated from their memories sometimes its an abstract concept like a forgotten dream or a moment of courage they never had and sometimes he paused his eyes twinkling its just a really good cup of spectral coffee to help them think things through just then a small shimmering bell on the desk chimed faintly mr e gestured towards a monitor on the desk which flickered to life showing a grainy blackandwhite image of a ghost with a bowler hat arguing with a spectral cashier in what looked like the lost found desires section ah a customer service issue already mr e said sounding almost gleeful see never a dull moment thats bartholomew he insists his ability to whistle the complete works of beethoven backward was stolen from him at the moment of his demise agnes our cashier in lost found is trying to explain that musical talent is not a refundable item postmortem he looked at me expectantly well david whats your first managerial decision i stared at the monitor then at mr e my old life with its crushing debts and failed aspirations felt like a distant hazy dream this was my new reality a store for the dead managed by a man who looked like hed stepped out of a fashion magazine from another dimension staffed by ghosts and selling echoes and regrets okay i said taking a deep breath my heart was still pounding but a strange almost manic energy was starting to course through me first we need to clarify the return policy on intangible items second whos agnes and can she actually hear bartholomew whistling backward mr e threw his head back and laughed a rich genuine sound that briefly seemed to chase away the ethereal chill of the msd brilliant david absolutely brilliant i knew i picked the right man come lets go introduce you to agnes and then we can discuss the finer points of spectral retail law he rose and i followed a bizarre sense of purpose already starting to replace the hollow ache in my chest what the hell indeed but for the first time in a long time i wasnt thinking about how to end things i was thinking about how to manage them chapter 3 the intangible inventory agnes was well she was a ghost obviously but unlike the headless knight or the woman with the chest wound agnes looked completely normal a bit frumpy maybe with her hair pulled back in a tight bun and a sensible cardigan draped over her shoulders she stood behind a counter laden with shimmering almost invisible objects tapping a spectral pen against a ledger that seemed to write itself agnes my dear mr e purred gliding up to the counter allow me to introduce david miller your new manager agnes looked up her expression a mix of weary professionalism and mild irritation her eyes a startling shade of ice blue fixed on me another one she sighed not unkindly they usually dont last a week most of them get the vapors when they realize customer complaints here sometimes involve spontaneous combustion or temporary temporal displacement charming as ever agnes mr e said with a theatrical shrug david agnes was a school librarian before a rather unfortunate incident involving an overdue copy of grimms fairy tales and a particularly irate parent shes excellent at cataloging and maintaining order even in the most chaotic circumstances nice to meet you agnes i managed feeling utterly out of my depth about bartholomew and his whistling can he actually do that and is there a refund policy for you know skills agnes sniffed pushing her spectacles up her nose bartholomew was a virtuoso yes he lost his ability to whistle due to a sudden fatal case of laryngitis brought on by a particularly potent poltergeist prank during a sance as for refunds on intangible talents absolutely not we facilitate their remembrance mr miller not their restoration we are a store not a miracle worker although ive heard rumors that the forgotten arts crafts section sometimes dabbles in restorative enchantment but thats strictly against msd policy and highly unregulated mr e winked at me agnes is a stickler for the rules a valuable asset in an establishment such as this so what exactly is in lost found desires i asked gesturing to the shimmering display it looked like static on a tv screen but with an underlying glow anything a spirit has lost or desired during their lifetime and wishes to reexperience mr miller agnes explained her tone softening slightly as if discussing her favorite subject a lost childhood toy a fleeting moment of courage the taste of a specific meal a conversation they never had a dream they couldnt quite grasp we help them access the memory package it if you will so they can hold it examine it find peace with it and its tangible to them yes she said to us its a construct of memory and belief very fragile not meant for resale mind you bartholomews whistle is a memory package he keeps trying to return it because he believes if he gets rid of the memory hell get the skill back he wont its a common misconception among the newly departed so my job is to manage these transactions i asked picturing myself arguing with a ghost about store credit for a lost sense of humor partially mr e interjected your job is to ensure the smooth operation of the store david that means managing the staff living and otherwise ensuring inventory is replenished handling interdepartmental disputes and occasionally mediating customer complaints that escalate beyond agness considerable patience just then a spectral shriek echoed from further down the aisle a tall translucent man in what looked like a tattered toga was floating wildly knocking over several displays of flickering ethereal trinkets my laurels theyre gone my victory is unacknowledged he wailed agnes sighed dramatically oh for heavens sake its old senator gracchus again he lost his election then his life and now he insists weve misplaced his imaginary victory wreath see david mr e said a twinkle in his eye a classic case for managerial intervention whats your play i blinked senator gracchus imaginary victory wreath my mind raced trying to recall any customer service training that covered ancient roman political ghosts uh does he respond to reason agnes snorted he responds to ego and the occasional theatrical gesture excellent insight agnes mr e beamed david the msd is built on emotion and perception what seems real here is real to gracchus those laurels are as real as your own beating heart i took a deep breath okay this was just like dealing with a difficult customer but with added spectral drama alright so he needs to feel acknowledged agnes do we have any acknowledged achievements in stock perhaps a symbolic victory package agnes actually looked surprised well we do have a moment of triumphant recognition in aisle seven under unfulfilled potential its rather dusty no ones asked for it in centuries perfect i declared a spark of something almost like enthusiasm flickering within me mr e agnes you two stay here im going to go talk to senator gracchus just point me to aisle seven mr es smile widened genuine amusement crinkling the corners of his eyes aisle seven david and perhaps try a slightly more resonant voice gracchus appreciates gravitas i nodded feeling a strange mix of terror and exhilaration as i walked towards the wailing roman the shimmering objects on the shelves seemed to pulse around me this wasnt just a job it was a performance and i was about to go on stage my old life had been about failure and despair this new one insane as it was was about trying to understand the incomprehensible and maybe just maybe finding a purpose in the pandemonium",

    "vitodens 100w boiler connected to radiant floor heat with copper pipes removing air we purchased a 100 year old home a few years back and the last few years we have been doing remodeling etc we removed and replaced older weilmclain boiler for a new vitodens 100w installed by a local company the new boiler is to heat water for the faucets and to bring hot water to hydronic baseboard heaters on first floor of house and second floor of house only issue we have had with setup is air in the pipes copper pipes on the second floor there is no air or issue with with pipes on first floor of house and i am not sure how to remove air from the pipes the pipes do not have purge valves on them anywhere thats part of the why did they do that things weve run across with this home but not a big deal except at night when were sleeping and we hear the pipes starting to make noise i came across these tips to remove air from pipes but not sure it is right direction to go steps to bleed air from copper pipes this method works for the entire homes pressurized water system both hot and cold lines 1 turn off the main water supply locate the main water valve usually in the basement near the water heater or outside the house and turn it off this is a critical step to stop fresh water from entering the system while you open the faucets 2 open all faucets starting with the highest faucet in your home eg an upstairs bathroom open both the hot and cold water taps about halfway this allows air to escape efficiently continue opening all other faucets and fixtures showers outdoor hose bibs etc one by one working your way down to the lowest floor 3 drain the system and flush toilets let all the water run out of the open faucets until it stops flowing completely then flush all the toilets in your home until no water remains in their tanks this uses gravity to help clear the water and air from the lines 4 slowly restore water supply go back to the main water supply valve and turn it back on very slowly a slow flow prevents a sudden surge of highpressure water which could cause damage or further trap air known as water hammer 5 let the water run allow the water to run through all the open faucets for about 10 to 15 minutes initially the water will likely sputter and spit as the trapped air is forced out wait until you see a steady continuous stream of water without any noise 6 close the faucets in order once the water runs smoothly from all fixtures turn them off start with the faucet closest to the main water valve and work your way to the highest and farthest faucet the reverse order of how you opened them any advice would be appreciated no issue with or in calling service company who installed boiler id just like to have an understanding of issue and correcting it myself especially if it needs to be addressed again in the future",
    "im red and i live philosophy theology and history so i went on a way longer than intended rant about lorehold and strixhaven so the criteria for an idea or activity being a color is different than the criteria for a person being a color the prismari are a school that uses logic science and passion to make art and the most appropriate color for that school is defintely redblue however a person who attends prismari is not for that reason redblue even if they are highly likely to be so one of the major differences between a concrete thing like a real person and a mental construct like a fictional character is that a real person is always completely determined i have a definte weight even if nobody knows what it is whereas somebody like jace belren can have a kind of reality while only having a general number as to how much he weighs having a strixhaven card like fiery artist is different from a card like prismari magmashaper because in the first case were getting information about the character as opposed to information about what they do right now these two characters are only their names they are not further determined in any way i didnt give any information about the color of my two hypothetical characters but we can at least assume that they are both red what they are doing is not important to their identity as red but the fact that they are doing red activities and the fact that i type them as red lead us to make further assumptions as to what they are like we can determine how they would react to ideas and situations which is what makes them really red that being said i really love lorehold and i think that the combination of philosophy theology and history is really red white though i think its weird that silverquill got ethics as something seperate from philosophy but whatever i think the biggest obstscle to freedom is ideas going to prison might take your freedom for a while but an idea could lead to you making your own prison out in the dessert away from all your family and friends and passions its an internal policeman that can gobern you far more harshly than any external policeman can red and white are the two colors most concerned with how am i personally going to live my life history shows us that black style self interest often comes back to bite the people that practice it or how selfless people might be randomly rewarded stepping on others to get ahead isnt fun and when theres no guarantee that its even going to get you ahead its just a bad deal history shows us that you cant just obey tradition and authority even if you want to because tradition and authority often differs from itself its very important to me that i incorporate arabic and jewish sources into my theology for variety its like being the child of an arabic father and an indian mother you cant just do what your ancestors have been doing for thousands of years because that would be self contradictory it forces you to choose for yourself the study of the history of science shows us that very intelligent and very well studied people often believed some pretty wild things and that many of them were in contradiction with each other just compare the beliefs of enlightenment luminaries like descartes leibniz kant locke and hume the founder of modern logic is somewhat infamous for his failed lifelong attempt to give a logical foundation to mathematics and his attempts to use his logical ideas to ground his racism and anti semitism and then the people who learned from him used those very same ideas to combat racism and antisemitism the study of theology and objective ethics is satisfying for the individual even if they turn out to be wrong in a way that science and more modern philosophies arent if i spend my life studying god and i decide that he isnt real that gives me a real direction in how im going to live my life in a way that spending my life studying a scientific theory that turns out to be false wont the false scientific theory might still help advance knowledge but it does very little to help me theology can be used in a white way or a red way if i study it and decide its true great i have a white guide to life if i study theology and decide its false great i have red freedom and i response to anybody who would tell me otherwise if i were to elect a real life philosopher as dean of lorehold i would elect blaise pascal blaise pascal was a french scientist who turned theologian and he is famous for claiming that every decision in life is a gamble including our religious decisions and that the heart has its reasons that reason does not know about he also once said something like my knowledge of internal things can console me for my lack of scientific knowledge but scientific knowledge will never console me for a lack of knowledge of internal things something like that im just going off memory",

cosmodelia as a scene or a genre when its a word i made up to designate a vibe a concentration of spaceage themed 90s electronic easy listening music in its blood there is a callback to spaceage roughly 5669 lounge records with their moog melodies but there is also traces of 70s kosmische music of germany with the electronic experimentations of bands like harmonia and tangerine dream more recent to the time period is the wave of artists doing space rock revival like spacemen 3 and moonshake which had played with elements of neopsychedelia whatever that is and trends in british indie like shoegaze however cosmodelia is in fact a departure from that indie rock spirit as it draws from what was going on in ambient the electronic listening music of artificial intelligence warp records in general and the rise of chillout music add in a pop sensibility based on retromania and you roughly arrive at the formula of cosmodelia still each of the bands featured had their own unique sound palette and as the bonus rate shows there were a lot of different styles but the commonality is the invocation of space whether in the naming the lyrics or the spaciousness of the melodies and beats some critics saw the music as futuristic despite the retro focus and they had a point the music seemed to belong to an imaginary space distant from the thenpresent however they dont seem to belong to now either making thought exercises like the one from john mulvey look silly but i think that preserves the magic i find the music featured here more comforting than anything in both its warm moments and the cold it envelops me with sounds of an unspecified time and space but enough rambling about vibes what actually is in the rate air moon safari air french band not to be confused by swedish band air france released their debut album moon safari on january 16 1998 16 days too late to make this rate a perfectly aligned 1997 affair nicolas godin and jeanbenot dunckel the duo behind the project were far from the first to fuse lounge with downtempo electronic music and they would not be the last yet there is something about moon safari that feels singular part of it is due to the level of craftsmanship presented here from the iconic bassline of the opener la femme dargent to the delicately layered synths of kelly watch the stars this album is full of sounds engineered to the finest details but the music itself is too chic to demand your attentionmaking it perhaps the perfect album to actually imagine yourself on a trip across space never too demanding of a listen to draw your attention from the vast wonders surrounding you out there but never a disappointing soundscape that would distract you from the experience and want to put on another record the first single of the three that were released after the album was out sexy boy proves one exception to the rule with its wobbling intro and catchy chorus but in an air fashion it is perhaps the least hot song about being sexy which has its own coolness in a way moon safari despite being chronologically the last album to come out in the lineup feels the most emblematic when it came out it drew comparisons to other loungeinfluenced pop albums of the time most notably dots and loops the influences from french pop artists such as serge gainsbourg were also of note after it came out music of this caliber drew comparisons to moon safari instead and it was not an album without its imitators including air themselves whose following career could be characterized by how much they moved away from the sound they perfected here and how much they later returned to it since 2023 air have been touring the 25th anniversary of this album the one that put them on the map and for better or worse their defining record they made a stop in istanbul this june which i was lucky enough to see and they put on a great show remember forever 1 la femme dargent 2 sexy boy 3 all i need feat beth hirsch 4 kelly watch the stars 5 talisman 6 remember 7 you make it easy feat beth hirsch 8 ce matin l 9 new star in the sky 10 le voyage de pnlope fishmans uch nippon setagaya following a debut album that launched the career of a duo we have the bookend of a career that of the japanese trio fishmans fronted by shinji sato and rounded by bassist yuzuru kashiwabara and kinichi moteki on drums fishmans released three albums on polydor between 19951997 dubbed the setagaya trilogy where the sound of the band shifted from their earlier pop rock with reggae and funk grooves to a more drawnout psychedelic sound heavily influenced by dub thanks to zak kazuyuki matsumura who had arranged for their polydor deal and engineered their final albums the first single with polydor nightcruising proved a success and became their most recognizable tune leading up to the release of kch camp translated commonly as something in the air and not aerial camp for reasons unknown to me which seems to be the bands mostcanonized album in japan at least for a long time after its release but the fame of fishmans over in the west is mostly a result of online music forums in 4chan and rym picking up on the second installment of setagaya trilogy the 35minute album length track long season uch nippon setagaya space japan setagaya closes out the trilogy with elements of both its predecessors it is a return to more individuated songbysong structure the band had in kch camp but the songs themselves are more abstract longer in length and more spaced out in the arrangements like in long season the lead single magic love finds the band remembering that they were making funk music a couple albums ago and is the most upbeat tune on the record the rest of the onehour runtime is made up with more laidback music sato said of the album that he wanted the music to reach out to one person a listening experience between each individual listening to it and the music many of the songs in the album are about two people their descriptions kept intentionally vague as the narrator sings about onesided observations or yearning this feeling of distance is often amplified by the feeling of vastness in the instrumental it is not a particularly sad album however thanks to the warmth of satos voice which might need some getting used to or simply not be your cup of tea but when it hits it feels like hes hugging you like a cloud enveloping you perhaps it was due to satos music for one person attitude that the band saw a major rise in popularity with the digital age where people can put on their headphones and withdraw into the music goodnight tomorrow 1 pokka pokka 2 weather report 3 ushiro sugata 4 in the flight 5 magic love 6 backbeat ni nokkatte 7 walking in the rhythm 8 daydream the music video for walking in the rhythm contains the prototype mix from the single version laika sounds of the satellites the final track on sounds of the satellites dirty feet and giggles contains a radio broadcast about laika the dog that soviets put on the spacecraft sputnik 2 and launched into space on november 3rd 1957 on the week of the 40th anniversary of the bolshevik revolution while i will not go into the details of laikas fate here her survival was never part of the plan and the shuttle was her coffin the music of laika can also get eerie moody and at times disturbing the lyrics of margaret fiedler which she usually delivers with a soft whisper can touch on topics like loneliness selfharm tendencies and abuse soundtracking her bleak lyrics are the long passages of dubby and jazzy grooves the odd time signatures here and there electronic bleep bloops transmitted from space and the occasional flute melodies fiedler had previously been a member of experimental rock band moonshake one of the earliest bands on the too pure records roster she departed from the band alongside later laika bassist john frenett in 1993 and formed laika with guy fixsen who had produced the moonshake releases on too pure laikas debut album 1994s silver apples on the moon drew attention from critics as part of the first wave of postrock simon reynolds grouped them under the name postrock groove collectives alongside pram tortoise and rome the followup was even more slick n smooth polishing out the rockier edges resulting in a sound that was no means lesser out of the four acts in this lineup laika remains the most enigmatic in its aura making them for me the most alluring in sound while this rate includes a lot of sonic ideas as to what space would sound like the 15 minutes of silence between the song and the broadcast in the closer is the only accurate simulation of what you would hear if you were adrift in space i wont disencourage skipping ahead the silence jump to 1820 but more than anyone else in this rate laika nails down the sound of being adrift in space without any sense of direction nbsp nbsp nbsp and i like to imagine the silence was part of the intent 1 prairie dog 2 breather 3 out of

dots and loops stereolab was an autoinclusion in any cosmodelia lineup as they were not only making music that invoked space but they were also one of the most prolific and creative bands of the 90s 1997s dots and loops is the album where stereolab supposedly ditched the indie rock to make avantpop turns out things are not usually as binary as sometimes made out to be marking a central moment in the stepping out of rock conventions i mentioned in the introduction as part of the cosmodelic ethos but as i am no expert on the stereolab expanded universe at large today we welcome a guest lecturer

band impenetrable while i look at their litany dispatches as mile wide sound explorations a state of the groop if you will stereolab was always tinkering and depending on where you hop in you find yourself exploring a different facet of the band and why many folks offer gaggles of opinions on their output the bands novelty or nothing approach made them their own island in the postrock archipelago who else was signing early with too pure and being in the scene that celebrates itself trading synths with labradford pushing dengers neu beat into modern indie drumming while also working

and the early 2000s that were deemed by yours truly to be cosmodelic in name and in sound some of them are more indebted to air than anything else some of them are more indebted to postrock others are

and all of them are independent from one another so you can choose the galaxies you want to see or hear in this case unlike typical bonus rate rules all three songs in one galaxy are required scoring for me to accept the scores for that galaxy this was a workaround for me to highlight some stuff that i did not feel like prioritizing over the official bonus rate due to timeframe mismatch sheer song length or simply being too niche however i encourage spending some time with the curation here as i think it is really fun and it adds some more perspective to the whole thing which is always nice 1

repeated public demands supported by lieberman to occupy the gaza strip i convened the cabinet i asked the chief of staff to present the plan for the ground occupation and the cost in human lives i then asked the defense ministry to estimate the resources that would be required to manage gaza at the end of the war i believed that the cost in human lives and resources did not justify such an action i was impressed that all the cabinet members agreed with me although they were reluctant to say so publicly eliminating hamas would require the introduction of large infantry forces into gaza an action that could result in hundreds of our deaths and many thousands on the palestinian side here the question also arose to whom would we hand over gaza and its two million inhabitants after we occupied it there would be no party other than the idf to control it after the occupation and this control could last for years did i have any interest in tying the idf to the gaza strip indefinitely when the greater threat posed by iran and perhaps also from a possible front with syria the unequivocal answer was no we had much more important military objectives netanyahu also tries to give his side to the claims he incited against rabin the security collapse in israel after the oslo agreement gave me a clear advantage over rabin in the polls in a channel 2 poll in early february 1995 i received 52 percent support compared to rabins 39 percent a tel aviv university poll in midmarch increased the gap to 60 percent compared to 40 percent the days after rabins assassination were fraught with difficult emotions world leaders came to pay their last respects president clinton delivered a moving eulogy many ceremonies were held in his memory at all these gatherings there was always someone who took the trouble to implicitly accuse the religious right and me of rabins assassination my political opponents completely ignored the repeated calls i made to my supporters before the assassination not to see rabin as an enemy but as a mistaken political opponent who would be replaced in the elections to them i was an enemy of peace and an inciter of political violence these outrageous claims were repeated endlessly and were accepted by the elites in israel and abroad as selfevident truth netanyahu also tries to separate rabin from the left and highlights some of their agreements in the months following the assassination any criticism of oslo was labeled as incitement and an attempt to eliminate rabins legacy it doesnt matter that this legacy gradually changed its face and became a fantasy that distorted the perception of rabin while he was alive despite all my disagreements with him rabin was by no means what the left made him out to be all of this is a far cry from the story that the supporters of oslo are trying to tell they claim that if rabin had not been assassinated he would have promoted the establishment of a palestinian state with full sovereignty including almost all of judea and samaria with east jerusalem as its capital this is simply not true in many ways rabins vision did not correspond to the principles of the left the supporters of oslo will never admit it but before the assassination rabins positions were closer to mine than to theirs what followed the murder was a reversal of democratic norms a heinous act of murder by one criminal became a tool for the delegitimization of an entire camp in the israeli public you can see from the lines that netanyahu probably had a similar issue with the rabin legacy like how nixon had with jfks among the lines bibi probably sees himself as the true victim of the murder he clearly also has a lot of appreciation but an issue with bill clinton that both clinton and barak were blind to this simple truth is unfathomable blinded by the pursuit of fame and the hope of winning the nobel peace prize clinton and barak dive down the rabbit hole of palestinian peace promises and discover that they have nothing in them if only israel would agree to more concessions clinton believed the palestinians would make peace when he visited israel after the wye conference in december 1998 he traveled to gaza and gave a passionate speech to the plo executive committee naively believing that his emotional appeal would win their hearts when i failed to make the farreaching concessions that he believed were a precondition for a final peace agreement he turned his attention to barak and helped him defeat me in his eyes and in the eyes of his people this often meant that israel had to be saved from itself since time after time israeli voters had proven that they probably didnt know what was best for them one of my associates commented on this ironically after all what do we know we just live here if for clinton saving israel required blatant interference in its domestic elections he had no hesitation in initiating such interference twice he sent his political advisers to israel to help peres and barak in the elections against me the first time he confessed to me when he failed and the second time he openly celebrated his victory when he succeeded ironically the people who falsely accused me of interfering in the us elections were the ones who interfered in the israeli elections to bring me down despite his tireless efforts to unseat me as prime minister i couldnt help but like clinton personally while democrats often complain that netanyahu is impossible to work with and its hard to push him for concessions netanyahu clearly sees that as a compliment and likes to boast about how he knows to withstand and stand against pressures albright later wrote in her memoirs that negotiating with me was likened to torture i considered that a great compliment i was defending the jewish state my meeting with albright took place in a london hotel as soon as it began she gave me an ultimatum i had to accept some clause that i opposed in the negotiations with the palestinians you have two hours to give me an answer she told me if you refuse i will go down to the journalists waiting in the lobby and tell them who is responsible for the failure of peace i was furious inside thats it madam secretary of state i said i dont need two hours i dont even need two minutes lets end the meeting now and both of us go down to speak to the world media you tell them what you want i tell them that as prime minister of israel i will not jeopardize the thousandyearold jewish struggle for our own place among the nations by giving in to conditions that endanger the one and only jewish state he also shows a lot of suspicion towards clerks and bureaucrats in some ways netanyahu predated trump in his approach towards the civil servants the deep state and in close doors he mocked europes economies for relying on the civil servants his hatred for the liberal media is also hard to ignore disengaged american clerks repeatedly got their predictions wrong they underestimated the power of the islamists with trump it couldnt be any other way he took the debate in directions that interested him and ignored the agenda that the bureaucrats tried to dictate to him the medias extraordinary generosity towards sharon in the face of suspicion of receiving illegal donations was in stark contrast to the attitude of journalists and bureaucrats who later sought to bring me down my father and i watched the action from our balcony after a brief moment my father dismissed with one word clerks and went back inside i am convinced that at that moment a skepticism towards bureaucracy began in me that i carry with me to this day my efforts to cut taxes have met with fierce opposition from another unexpected sourcethe treasury departments legal advisors i could see they were not convinced i said in frustration okay dont defend me ill do it myself and bring nobel prizewinning economists to the stand to support my case that ended the argument the wind went out of the bureaucrats sails television was largely a closed clique of the left and served as a breeding ground for media professionals who staffed the commercial channels that were later opened the ruling media oligarchy sought to preserve its power through legislative barriers to entry in television and radioa phenomenon that intensified especially after the likud came to power in the historic 1977 elections israeli media executives see shifting public opinion to the left as their personal mission they cannot hide their joy when the left forms a government and have difficulty containing their bitterness when the right comes to power i believe that this elephant skin that i developed only made things worse with the many leftwing journalists they felt that unlike other politicians on the right the venomous attacks did not deter me or make me bow down to them to put it mildly many in the media elite have difficulty accepting the democratic choice of the citizens of israel almost half a century after the first victory of the likud they still see it as a usurpation of the lefts natural and proper control of the country television was largely a closed clique of the left and served as a breeding ground for media professionals who staffed the commercial channels that were later opened the ruling media oligarchy sought to preserve its power through

    "realistically what did you want the democrats to do on the shutdown republicans refused to concede in any manner trump touted the idea of firing people who were working in the government snap was about to expire during the holidays people were going to miss their third paycheck yes this is the republicans fault but at the same time is it possible that some of these democrat congresspeople just wanted their constituents to get paid and get food for the holidays its a game of chicken and the democrats chickened but to an extent i dont blame the defectors republicans are ok with suffering they were willing to deprive their consiguents of snap so what happens if the republicans refuse to concede to anything i know we see this as a loss but i can understand why people defected and i absolutely think it was coordinated in a way to sacrifice the people not vulnerable in upcoming elections",

stand before you humbly and proudly as the 10th president of this beautiful country the people have spoken and have given their president a powerful mandate to articulate their vision for a new republic a republic worthy of its name where everyone is valued and diversity is cherished where sustainable solutions are urgently implemented and where a home is a fundamental human right the change that led to this joyful day began with a small group of elected representatives and volunteers facing what appeared to be insurmountable challenges we were led to believe that it was too great a leap that our ideas were too far out too left at odds with the prevailing narrative in shared conversations all over the country however it became evident that the dominant narrative did not reflect or represent peoples values and concerns time and time again people spoke of how it served to silence to other to label to exclude and to stifle critical thinking along with that however along with meaningful engagement we saw the emergence of hope we saw the emergence of joy along with the courage and determination of people to use their voices to shape a country that we can be proud of as president of ireland i will ensure that all voices are represented heard and valued and promote a public discourse that nourishes inclusivity tolerance and active citizenship previous presidents faced different challenges reflecting the dominant issues of the day in 1990 when mary robinson and i want to welcome mary robinson and her husband nick when mary was elected the parameters of geopolitics were shifting following the fall of the berlin wall the previous year and the dissolution of the soviet union while at home ireland was undergoing its own seismic changes laying the foundation for a modern and inclusive society in 1997 one year before the good friday agreement the former president mary mcaleese and again i want to welcome the former president and husband martin was elected in the midst of the ongoing peace process a landmark event in shaping a shared vision for the future of ireland in 2011 michael d higgins assumed office and again i want to pay tribute to his courage and his work michael d assumed office as a global financial collapse shook ireland and the world the reverberations of that crisis continue to impact upon and shape peoples lives and our economy now in 2025 as i assume the privilege of office we face the existential threat of climate change and the threat of ongoing wars both of course are inextricably linked as i speak i am acutely conscious of the 165 million people currently forcibly displaced from their homes and countries due to war famine and climate change we cannot turn back the clock nor close our eyes to these realities these are the challenges of our times and our actions or inaction will determine the world our children and grandchildren will inherit it is both an individual and a collective challenge and one which obliges us to reflect on the way we live and interact with our world and with each other it is also the responsibility of those entrusted with public office to come together both nationally and internationally to lead and to create the conditions for a sustainable existence on our planet it is significant that today is remembrance day the eleventh of the eleventh 2025 it is significant on so many levels but it gives us an opportunity to pause and reflect on the horrors of war in a world where unfortunately we have all become witnesses to ongoing wars and genocide given our history the normalisation of war and genocide has never been and will never be acceptable to us as a sovereign independent nation with a long and cherished tradition of neutrality and an uninterrupted record of peacekeeping since 1958 ireland is particularly well placed to lead and articulate alternative diplomatic solutions to conflict and war indeed our experience of colonisation and resistance of a catastrophic manmade famine and forced emigration gives us a lived understanding of dispossession hunger and war and a mandate for ireland to lead we can and should take real pride in the success of the good friday agreement knowing that this is recognised far and wide and is a model for peaceful resolution of conflict we also know that this journey of peace and reconciliation was the result of meticulous and methodical work over a long period of time and this work continues to this day i look forward to paying my first official visit to the north and meeting with people from all communities and celebrating the rich heritage and traditions of all who live there i am particularly conscious of article 3 of the constitution which sets out in detail the firm wish of the irish people the irish nation to have a united ireland albeit in the conditions set out very clearly in the article on consent as president i will foster an inclusive and open dialogue across the island in a manner that highlights and recognises our similarities and respects our differences i want to acknowledge our large and growing diaspora there is hardly a family on this island that does not have a personal experience of migration on every continent our emigrants have put their ingenuity and hard work at the service of new homelands yet they have kept their love of ireland and its culture deep in their hearts i hope over the next 7 years that there will be many opportunities for me to celebrate with them and share our experiences i have never believed more in the spirit of this country having travelled the length and breadth of the island i have witnessed it in every county in every corner of ireland i have heard it in the music the literature and the dance of our people in the deep tradition of solidarity and decency that continues to be the dominant force behind our people i have felt it in the quiet dignity and stoicism of those who simply keep going despite the very real challenges that they face is sibhse muintir na tre cosmhuintir na tre a casadh orm agus m ar fud na tre a spreag m agus a spreag mfhoireann le linn an fheachtais sibhse a chuaigh agus a thann i ngleic

    "national feminism and the hypocrisy of the political right a trend has emerged in the political landscape this trend attempts once again to exploit and position women or as they call them females for political purposes as a german i recently witnessed this in the statement made by german chancellor friedrich merz of the cdu the christian conservative party of germany as well as in the us after the new york mayoral election the chancellors statement was roughly as follows but of course we still have this problem in the cityscape he said in the context of his government having already done a great deal regarding migration deportations this drew criticism because he implied that nongermans were a problem in the cityscape and that one could judge a persons criminality by looking at them when asked about it later at a press conference he grinned and said ask your daughters what i could have meant by that i suspect youll get a pretty clear and unambiguous answer i have nothing to take back the political right is attempting to coopt feminism with such statements they portray themselves as defenders and advocates trying to position feminism and women as a whole against foreigners or for example against trans people see jk rowling this shifts the focus of the debate suddenly the discussion turns to what constitutes a woman and even worse the opponent is redefinedfrom the patriarchal system to foreigners the attempt is being made to blame only foreigners or transgender people two goals are hoped to be achieved in this way firstly more people are to be mobilised against foreigners andor transgender people in order to gain political capital from the demonisation of minorities the culture war has long been the only way the right wing conducts politics secondly this serves to distract from the patriarchy the deep social cultural and economic roots of the patriarchy are to be replaced by simple enemy images it is obvious that the right wing has no desire to change this systemic disadvantage for women feminism and women are merely a means to an end the actual reality for women is ignored and reinterpreted when friedrich merz says daughters are afraid to go out at night he certainly hits a nerve but neglects the fact that firstly foreigners are not solely to blame and secondly that a woman is more likely to be raped in her own home than on the street if friedrich merz or the political right truly had an interest in womens policy they would take action against it and not merely use women as an argument to justify their antimigration policies rightwing interests do not concern themselves with women thats the conclusion i draw from this government the hypocrisy is particularly evident in the election of zoran mamdani according to statistics from tufts circles 84 of young women under 30 voted for mamdani the rightwing reaction followed on twitterx and youtube with talk of overturning the 19th amendment and of disenfranchising women because they werent satisfied with the result this completely disregards the fact that 70 of young men also voted for mamdani its nothing other than misogyny im saying it clearly its becoming increasingly common on the internet and unfortunately people tend to get used to things very quickly but this is nothing other than misogyny instead of acknowledging the problems and concerns of 50 of the population and making policy accordingly they shoud rather be disenfranchised and beaten into submission this isnt just happening in the usa even in the rather moderate or at least it used to be germany ive encountered people who wanted to disenfranchise women in germany as in almost every other part of the world women tend to lean left this was demonstrated among other things by the fact that many young women have become members of die linke or the left party the only truly leftwing party in germany the reaction of the political right or at least parts of it was to wish rape upon these women to wish such a thing upon ones political opponent while simultaneously inciting hatred against foreigners with the phrase protect our women shows how depraved and insincere this is the emphasis here is on our the sharpest sword these people can wield against women and leftists in general is the bogeyman of sharia completely disregarding the fact that countries like afghanistan are of course perverse and oppressive regimes that every leftist and feminist must fight against it is nonetheless astonishing that all those who warn against sharia here and in the united states are also those who want to introduce it however in their version the lawgiver is not allah or mohammed but christ pastor dale partridge is one such person who advocates disenfranchising women i saw a video from him argue for it his god may have a different name than the talibans but the command is the same oppress women no matter the political issue rightwingers conservatives and christian nationalists are always on the opposing side when it comes to womens selfdetermination and equality in germany the afd the libertarian fascists want to economically subjugate women and make the family dependent on a single income again its clear who is supposed to earn that income and who is supposed to stay at home for these people a womans voice outside of her relationship with her husband is meaningless when someone like sen tommy tuberville proposes a no sharia law act and has the nerve to write about sharia on twitterx under sharia law women get raped trafficked and abused it makes my blood boil while simultaneously being in a party that actively oppresses womenabortion bans statements by politicians about women etc it only demonstrates unparalleled hypocrisy its clear that sharia is antifeminist and incompatible with a free and equal society but as already mentioned these people arent concerned with protecting women these politicians are not protectors they scare people with a spectre and try to win over women and liberal men we will defend you against the foreign threat they say but they conveniently omit the fact that the price is your freedom and dignity and now seeing that they cant win women over so easily that their cheap populism isnt working theyre talking about disenfranchisement and similar measures those who dont follow will be forced to only the women of ones own nation are valued and even then only if they are wellbehaved and submissive bear many children and are nice to look at republicans wont protect you from sharia law christian nationalists wont protect you from islamism and friedrich merz who voted against criminalising marital rape in 1997 wont protect daughters from their rapists either",

both sidesregime and protests have high radicalism and low popularitytrust the regime took a beating and those earlier enchanted by their propaganda begin to leave its side their legitimacy fades and the top down structure it starts desintegrating into cliques the protesters start to view the protest leadership as controledregimesystem opposition and are sick of their inaction and dogmatic upholding of peaceful and dignified protest methods they are tired of the constant cycle their emotions repressed in the name of peace and dignity their vision denied reality que the music the release valve dissent and civil disobedience are nothing new for as long as man had the ability to govern and to be governed there had been disagreements and hostilities between the sovereign and their subjects many different methods have been utilized by the sovereigns of old to disperse and weaken these movements from compromise to brute force they had varying success but none was more effective in the long term as was controled opposition when a major upset occurs call up the system opposition and have them rally the people they will pretend to hold themselves on a moral highground above the regime and will therefore only use peaceful methods that while good at rallying support will never actualy threathen the regime eventualy the protests will lose momentum and end this has always left the people with a sour taste in their mouth and desiring for more but as long as their organisers were regime agents that anger was impotent pressure the average young adult dissatisfied with this regime has seen and been a part of many movements in the last few years all of them following the exact same formula all of the ending in the exact same way each time they saw the song and dance play out they grew more distrustful of both the regime and organised resistance each time left them more and more agitated and made their feeling of dissatisfaction grow more and more into hatered the regime in their neverending hubris overplayed their hand and humiliated the people by attacking them regularly while making their leadership call for peaceful protests what kind of fools do they take us as the regime fired volleys of petards trash and tear gas towards us and they want to remain dignified and peaceful said a man to his friend this made the people take matters in their own hands the controled opposition and governing institutions kept calling for peace but their calls were meaningless militias formed people both pro and anti regime started raiding everything from pharmacies to police arms depos state and civil authority was becoming weaker and weaker by the minute stone wood fire nature human nature is a potent and nasty force humans were given free will but they had to sacrifice a part of it to make organised society work they had to sacrifice their impulses and self intrest and they had to trust an authority higher than themselves to ensure coexistence with another law only lasts as long as it had the authority to be enforced as my professor of legal science would put it and that authority relies on legitimacy legitimacy relies on trust when trust is gone legitimacy falls authority greatly weakens and even the arms that are supposed to enforce it may abandon it in pursuit of their own self intrest and that is when law and by extention the state stops existing trust is institutions the state protest leadership and even their fellow man has left the people they are resorting to either senseless violence mass suicide refuge abroad or tribal family conflict in pursuit of resources they live off the land and their own skills and pay no tax or attention to anyone claiming legitimacy over what was a state a mere few months ago no law no authority

full text joint statement by the chairs of lgbt lib dems lib dem women lib dem disability association lib dems campaign for race equality young liberals and presidential and vice presidential candidates the purpose of this statement is to report back on the meeting that we secured on 7th november with the barrister who issued the legal advice underpinning the partys decision on changing the diversity quotas for the federal elections and to tell you what we collectively have agreed to do following that meeting as the respective chairs of the affiliated organisations represented on the federal people and development committee and presidential and vice presidential candidates we were and remain appalled at the decision to change quotas rules for internal federal elections on 27th october after nominations had closed and the day before voting opened which has unacceptably undermined the dignity and inclusion of trans and nonbinary members in our party they deserve so much better than this not least because our quota system has historically been used to facilitate inclusion the barrister a kings counsel kc who has a track record of fighting for the rights of trans and nonbinary people fully answered our relentless questioning for approximately 90 minutes in summary we understood from the barrister that their legal opinion was that the former quota rules were not compliant with the supreme court judgement the party was therefore legally required to change the quota regime to give effect to the supreme court judgement candidates had entered into a contract with the party upon being nominated that explicitly involved the use of quotas under articles 25 and 26 in the constitution wider changes to the quota system whether by the returning officer or by members at a conference in the context of this contract given that candidates were already nominated would likely constitute a breach of contract the option of greatest legal viability remaining was therefore to retain the quota system but refashion it to reflect the supreme court judgement wider options would be legally viable for future federal elections so long as changes were made before the contract with candidates was established the party made its decision about the quota system for these federal elections on the basis of the opinion described above our view in light of this is that had the party and returning officer taken action to address the implications of the supreme court judgement sooner the ruling was 7 months ago in april 2025 the kc would have advised that more options would have been available it is unacceptable that the partys decision to change the quota rules was left until after nominations closed and therefore after the contract with candidates was initiated the delay appears to have been completely avoidable a full review must take place to understand the reasons for this delay and to identify castiron steps to ensure that the partys apparent options are not restricted by such significant failures ever again while we are doing the job of reporting back on what we were told in the meeting with the kc we are aware that members are exploring alternative legal opinions on this matter and that an appeal has been submitted to the partys federal appeals panel the situation may change as a result of those two things and we will closely follow efforts by members to test alternative legal opinions on this matter our next steps we are clear that this meeting was only the first step of a journey the affiliated organisations represented at the meeting and the presidential and vice presidential candidates are fully committed to the policy and principles of the free to be who you are motion that members overwhelmingly passed at spring conference 2025 in that stead we will work together to help develop a solution that honours our moral legal and liberal obligations to protect the rights of trans and nonbinary people and all members in terms of constitutional next steps the aos and candidates agreed in the session to meet again before christmas to begin working on a conference motion in pursuit of this in terms of political and legislative next steps we have requested to collectively meet with our partys women and equalities spokesperson to explore what options we can take to properly honour the liberty and dignity of trans and nonbinary people each ao represented will respectively bring proposals and ideas to these meetings based on their engagement with members and may communicate the development of these accordingly we are also concerned about the impact of the decision to change the quotas on trans and nonbinary candidates and about the level of attack that they may come under when the results of the elections are known we therefore have pushed the party to commit to the creation an online hub that signposts candidates to critical resources to support their wellbeing we have also discussed how we can better facilitate the provision of peer support for candidates especially trans and nonbinary candidates we thank all those who have supported us to hold the party to account for its actions here and will continue to fight for a society where noone including trans and nonbinary people is enslaved by poverty ignorance or conformity and where we are all able to live in a fair free and open society with equality and community at its heart",
