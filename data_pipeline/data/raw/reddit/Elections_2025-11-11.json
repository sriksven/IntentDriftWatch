eaglaise agus dhaoine uaisle ar fad chomh maith le an chad aire an tuaiscirt michelle oneill agus ceannair eile gach cairn den tuaisceart ba mhaith liom cad mile filte a chur roimh mo chlann freisin at anseo mo bheirt mhac mo fhearchile mo dheirfiracha mo dhearthireacha thaisteal siad cheann ceann an domhain atlanta georgia ceanada toronto agus mle buochas go chuir siad an dua sin orthu fin i stand before you humbly and proudly as the 10th president of this beautiful country the people have spoken and have given their president a powerful mandate to articulate their vision for a new republic a republic worthy of its name where everyone is valued and diversity is cherished where sustainable solutions are urgently implemented and where a home is a fundamental human right the change that led to this joyful day began with a small group of elected representatives and volunteers facing what appeared to be insurmountable challenges we were led to believe that it was too great a leap that our ideas were too far out too left at odds with the prevailing narrative in shared conversations all over the country however it became evident that the dominant narrative did not reflect or represent peoples values and concerns time and time again people spoke of how it served to silence to other to label to exclude and to stifle critical thinking along with that however along with meaningful engagement we saw the emergence of hope we saw the emergence of joy along with the courage and determination of people to use their voices to shape a country that we can be proud of as president of ireland i will ensure that all voices are represented heard and valued and promote a public discourse that nourishes inclusivity tolerance and active citizenship previous presidents faced different challenges reflecting the dominant issues of the day in 1990 when mary robinson and i want to welcome mary robinson and her husband nick when mary was elected the parameters of geopolitics were shifting following the fall of the berlin wall the previous year and the dissolution of the soviet union while at home ireland was undergoing its own seismic changes laying the foundation for a modern and inclusive society in 1997 one year before the good friday agreement the former president mary mcaleese and again i want to welcome the former president and husband martin was elected in the midst of the ongoing peace process a landmark event in shaping a shared vision for the future of ireland in 2011 michael d higgins assumed office and again i want to pay tribute to his courage and his work michael d assumed office as a global financial collapse shook ireland and the world the reverberations of that crisis continue to impact upon and shape peoples lives and our economy now in 2025 as i assume the privilege of office we face the existential threat of climate change and the threat of ongoing wars both of course are inextricably linked as i speak i am acutely conscious of the 165 million people currently forcibly displaced from their homes and countries due to war famine and climate change we cannot turn back the clock nor close our eyes to these realities these are the challenges of our times and our actions or inaction will determine the world our children and grandchildren will inherit it is both an individual and a collective challenge and one which obliges us to reflect on the way we live and interact with our world and with each other it is also the responsibility of those entrusted with public office to come together both nationally and internationally to lead and to create the conditions for a sustainable existence on our planet it is significant that today is remembrance day the eleventh of the eleventh 2025 it is significant on so many levels but it gives us an opportunity to pause and reflect on the horrors of war in a world where unfortunately we have all become witnesses to ongoing wars and genocide given our history the normalisation of war and genocide has never been and will never be acceptable to us as a sovereign independent nation with a long and cherished tradition of neutrality and an uninterrupted record of peacekeeping since 1958 ireland is particularly well placed to lead and articulate alternative diplomatic solutions to conflict and war indeed our experience of colonisation and resistance of a catastrophic manmade famine and forced emigration gives us a lived understanding of dispossession hunger and war and a mandate for ireland to lead we can and should take real pride in the success of the good friday agreement knowing that this is recognised far and wide and is a model for peaceful resolution of conflict we also know that this journey of peace and reconciliation was the result of meticulous and methodical work over a long period of time and this work continues to this day i look forward to paying my first official visit to the north and meeting with people from all communities and celebrating the rich heritage and traditions of all who live there i am particularly conscious of article 3 of the constitution which sets out in detail the firm wish of the irish people the irish nation to have a united ireland albeit in the conditions set out very clearly in the article on consent as president i will foster an inclusive and open dialogue across the island in a manner that highlights and recognises our similarities and respects our differences i want to acknowledge our large and growing diaspora there is hardly a family on this island that does not have a personal experience of migration on every continent our emigrants have put their ingenuity and hard work at the service of new homelands yet they have kept their love of ireland and its culture deep in their hearts i hope over the next 7 years that there will be many opportunities for me to celebrate with them and share our experiences i have never believed more in the spirit of this country having travelled the length and breadth of the island i have witnessed it in every county in every corner of ireland i have heard it in the music the literature and the dance of our people in the deep tradition of solidarity and decency that continues to be the dominant force behind our people i have felt it in the quiet dignity and stoicism of those who simply keep going despite the very real challenges that they face is sibhse muintir na tre cosmhuintir na tre a casadh orm agus m ar fud na tre a spreag m agus a spreag mfhoireann le linn an fheachtais sibhse a chuaigh agus a thann i ngleic

parliament shall be reserved for others these reserved percentages are measured against the total number of seats in parliament for the relevant electoral term b judiciary supreme court a target of 10 of judicial seats for women and 19 for others shall be established due to the small size of the judiciary the seat calculation rule below shall convert these percentages into whole seats and be applied transparently seat calculation rule integer rounding conflict resolution a percentages will be converted to whole seats by multiplying the applicable percentage by the total number of seats and rounding up to the nearest whole number ceiling function example if parliament has 15 seats 10 15 rounded up 2 reserved seats for women b if the sum of reserved seats for all categories would exceed total seats reserved seats shall be scaled down proportionally preserving relative proportions women others and then rounding up as needed provided no category receives less than one reserved seat when that categorys numerical target before scaling equals or exceeds 05 seats c for the judiciary currently five judges applying the percentages will be performed using the same rule when the calculated reserved seats for any category is zero ie percentage total 05 the appointing authority shall still ensure meaningful consideration of qualified candidates from that category and the supreme court shall include at least one sitting judge from each reserved category within the earliest practicable appointment cycle unless doing so would unavoidably exceed total seats under

the outstanding reserved seats by expedited special selection among the highestqualified remaining candidates of that category subject to confirmation processes set out below filling reserved seats in the judiciary nomination confirmation a for each supreme court vacancy the president shall nominate a candidate such that in aggregate across appointments the reserved seat numerical targets for women

scene so i cant say who will lead it all 3 sns routes inevitably fail an economy built on nepotism and a political system that emodies the dictators parodoxa dictator must surround himself with idiots but idiots are idiots and do idiot things while relying on foreigns support and domestic force cant lastor lead to anything good forced lib has to accept free media judiciary and elections which they have no way of surviving business as usual can either lose an election so bad they cant cover it up and give up power refuse to give up power and get the milosevic 5102000 treatmentcivil coup get the corpo coup or die by catharsis consolidated mafia state can be couped by the military invaded by the victor of 1ew noone would want a feral drug and organ trafficking state on their southern flank cms is in their respect for human rights just a tad better than awd corpo coup or catharsis catharsis occurs if the 20242025 protests last too long home by christmas turns into a multi year conflictand both sidesregime and protests have high radicalism and low popularitytrust the regime took a beating and those earlier enchanted by their propaganda begin to leave its side their legitimacy fades and the top down structure it starts desintegrating into cliques the protesters start to view the protest leadership as controledregimesystem opposition and are sick of their inaction and dogmatic upholding of peaceful and dignified protest methods they are tired of the constant cycle their emotions repressed in the name of peace and dignity their vision denied reality que the music the release valve dissent and civil disobedience are nothing new for as long as man had the ability to govern and to be governed there had been disagreements and hostilities between the sovereign and their subjects many different methods have been utilized by the sovereigns of old to disperse and weaken these movements from compromise to brute force they had varying success but none was more effective in the long term as was controled opposition when a major upset occurs call up the system opposition and have them rally the people they will pretend to hold themselves on a moral highground above the regime and will therefore only use peaceful methods that while good at rallying support will never actualy threathen the regime eventualy the protests will lose momentum and end this has always left the people with a sour taste in their mouth and desiring for more but as long as their organisers were regime agents that anger was impotent pressure the average young adult dissatisfied with this regime has seen and been a part of many movements in the last few years all of them following the exact same formula all of the ending in the exact same way each time they saw the song and dance play out they grew more distrustful of both the regime and organised resistance each time left them more and more agitated and made their feeling of dissatisfaction grow more and more into hatered the regime in their neverending hubris overplayed their hand and humiliated the people by attacking them regularly while making their leadership call for peaceful protests what kind of fools do they take us as the regime fired volleys of petards trash and tear gas towards us and they want to remain dignified and peaceful said a man to his friend this made the people take matters in their own hands the controled opposition and governing institutions kept calling for peace but their calls were meaningless militias formed people both pro and anti regime started raiding everything from pharmacies to police arms depos state and civil authority was becoming weaker and weaker by the minute stone wood fire nature human nature is a potent and nasty force humans were given free will but they had to sacrifice a part of it to make organised society work they had to sacrifice their impulses and self intrest and they had to trust an authority higher than themselves to ensure coexistence with another law only lasts as long as it had the authority to be enforced as my professor of legal science would put it and that authority relies on legitimacy legitimacy relies on trust when trust is gone legitimacy falls authority greatly weakens and even the arms that are supposed to enforce it may abandon it in pursuit of their own self intrest and that is when law and by extention the state stops existing trust is institutions the state protest leadership and even their fellow man has left the people they are resorting to either senseless violence mass suicide refuge abroad or tribal family conflict in pursuit of resources they live off the land and their own skills and pay no tax or attention to anyone claiming legitimacy over what was a state a mere few months ago no law no authority and no organised society only the need to survive to just feel anything",

    "joint statement by the chairs of lgbt lib dems lib dem women lib dem disability association lib dems campaign for race equality young liberals and presidential and vice presidential candidates full text joint statement by the chairs of lgbt lib dems lib dem women lib dem disability association lib dems campaign for race equality young liberals and presidential and vice presidential candidates the purpose of this statement is to report back on the meeting that we secured on 7th november with the barrister who issued the legal advice underpinning the partys decision on changing the diversity quotas for the federal elections and to tell you what we collectively have agreed to do following that meeting as the respective chairs of the affiliated organisations represented on the federal people and development committee and presidential and vice presidential candidates we were and remain appalled at the decision to change quotas rules for internal federal elections on 27th october after nominations had closed and the day before voting opened which has unacceptably undermined the dignity and inclusion of trans and nonbinary members in our party they deserve so much better than this not least because our quota system has historically been used to facilitate inclusion the barrister a kings counsel kc who has a track record of fighting for the rights of trans and nonbinary people fully answered our relentless questioning for approximately 90 minutes in summary we understood from the barrister that their legal opinion was that the former quota rules were not compliant with the supreme court judgement the party was therefore legally required to change the quota regime to give effect to the supreme court judgement candidates had entered into a contract with the party upon being nominated that explicitly involved the use of quotas under articles 25 and 26 in the constitution wider changes to the quota system whether by the returning officer or by members at a conference in the context of this contract given that candidates were already nominated would likely constitute a breach of contract the option of greatest legal viability remaining was therefore to retain the quota system but refashion it to reflect the supreme court judgement wider options would be legally viable for future federal elections so long as changes were made before the contract with candidates was established the party made its decision about the quota system for these federal elections on the basis of the opinion described above our view in light of this is that had the party and returning officer taken action to address the implications of the supreme court judgement sooner the ruling was 7 months ago in april 2025 the kc would have advised that more options would have been available it is unacceptable that the partys decision to change the quota rules was left until after nominations closed and therefore after the contract with candidates was initiated the delay appears to have been completely avoidable a full review must take place to understand the reasons for this delay and to identify castiron steps to ensure that the partys apparent options are not restricted by such significant failures ever again while we are doing the job of reporting back on what we were told in the meeting with the kc we are aware that members are exploring alternative legal opinions on this matter and that an appeal has been submitted to the partys federal appeals panel the situation may change as a result of those two things and we will closely follow efforts by members to test alternative legal opinions on this matter our next steps we are clear that this meeting was only the first step of a journey the affiliated organisations represented at the meeting and the presidential and vice presidential candidates are fully committed to the policy and principles of the free to be who you are motion that members overwhelmingly passed at spring conference 2025 in that stead we will work together to help develop a solution that honours our moral legal and liberal obligations to protect the rights of trans and nonbinary people and all members in terms of constitutional next steps the aos and candidates agreed in the session to meet again before christmas to begin working on a conference motion in pursuit of this in terms of political and legislative next steps we have requested to collectively meet with our partys women and equalities spokesperson to explore what options we can take to properly honour the liberty and dignity of trans and nonbinary people each ao represented will respectively bring proposals and ideas to these meetings based on their engagement with members and may communicate the development of these accordingly we are also concerned about the impact of the decision to change the quotas on trans and nonbinary candidates and about the level of attack that they may come under when the results of the elections are known we therefore have pushed the party to commit to the creation an online hub that signposts candidates to critical resources to support their wellbeing we have also discussed how we can better facilitate the provision of peer support for candidates especially trans and nonbinary candidates we thank all those who have supported us to hold the party to account for its actions here and will continue to fight for a society where noone including trans and nonbinary people is enslaved by poverty ignorance or conformity and where we are all able to live in a fair free and open society with equality and community at its heart",

    "should the next democratic president if there is one deemphasize foreign policy pretty much what the title says its often said that trust is gained in drops and lost in buckets i dont think the us former allies particularly canada are ever going to trust the us again weve wronged the whole world by electing trump twice even if a democrat wins in 2028 the damage to international relations will never be fully repaired the next president might try to patch things up and maybe theyll succeed to a limited extent but everyone knows that the next time a republican retakes the white house likely in 2032 well go right back to threatening to invade canada and greenland any deal that requires longer than a 4year commitment from the united states would be more useful as toilet paper i think the next democratic president should give up the facade that theres anything to be salvaged and admit that were just not allies with canzuk and europe anymore they should lay all the blame at the feet of the gop for good measure so that voters ideally know whos responsible i dont know what it would take for other countries to trust us again if thats even possible but i think never electing another republican president or electing one who doesnt threaten to invade ones former allies would be as good a start as any no matter what the next democratic president wont be able to do much in the way of foreign policy so why bother",

    "what is not covered by private insurance 2025 exclusions update hi all ive seen a few posts here from people who were surprised or disappointed when making a claim often because the issue wasnt covered it seems a lot of the confusion comes down to understanding the fundamental purpose of private medical insurance in the uk which is designed to work alongside the nhs not replace it the single most important concept to grasp is the distinction insurers make between acute and chronic conditions this is really the foundation of how most policies work an acute condition is a disease or injury that is likely to respond quickly to treatment and return you to your previous state of health think of things like a joint replacement hernia repair or treatment for a sudden infection pmi is designed to diagnose and treat these issues swiftly a chronic condition is a longterm illness that needs ongoing management rather than a cure this includes conditions like diabetes asthma high blood pressure and arthritis the daytoday management of these almost always remains with the nhs the reason for this hard line is primarily about keeping premiums affordable if policies were to cover the expensive lifelong management of chronic conditions the cost would become prohibitive for most people alongside this policies also have standard exclusions for preexisting conditions this typically means any illness or injury youve had symptoms advice or treatment for in the five years before your policy started this is often handled through moratorium underwriting where the exclusion is applied automatically without you needing to declare your full history upfront other common exclusions to be aware of are electivelifestyle procedures and while cover is improving there are still often significant limitations on mental health treatment understanding these limitations from the start is key to avoiding disappointment later full disclosure these insights are from a guide i work on whats one exclusion that surprised you when you first got your policy or is there a grey area between acute and chronic that youve found particularly confusing in your experience",

    "girlfriend 27f of 2 years refuses to find a job and im 23m at my breaking point am i correct in the conclusion ive come to is there any fixing this i have been with my girlfriend since 2023 and ever since we got together her life has plunged into a downward spiral when we met she had a car job and even rented a room in an older ladies house not long after we got together it appeared as if she quit on life 2 months later she lost the job she had at the time got kicked out of her place meanwhile i was doing well at the time and had my own place so i offered her support and housing while she got on her feet she managed to get a job months later in 2024 after i kicked her out after warning her 5000 times to get a job she started living out of her car and it seemed like she was getting back on her feet everything seemed to be going well for her until about 3 months into her employment she lost her job and a couple of months later she also lost her car due to the police towing it after giving her 100s of tickets and not very long after she also lost her phone by it unfortunately accidentally slipping out of her hand and falling into a sewer drain since i felt bad for her i allowed her to sleep overnight in my car under the conditions that she needs to actively be looking for and must find a stable job and must be out of my car by morning each day months passed and no progress was occurring on the find a job front so i decided to try and help her find a job i planned ahead took the whole month of june and early july off work in order to help her find a job during the whole month of june and early july i put all my effort into helping her i helped her by finding jobs for her writing resumes for her and even driving her to interviews and to work eventually with my help she got a job and she worked a grand total of 1 day before she was told to not come back and was paid off for the 1 day she worked every consecutive job she worked at would be the same working 13 days maximum getting fired getting paid for the hours she worked looking for the next job rinse repeat i believe that she purposely sabotages herself at work in order to get fired at each job she lasted no longer than a maximum of 3 days 3 was rare 21 was the most common usually everytime she was fired i asked her why she was fired she would respond with i dont know then she would of course lament how she doesnt know what employers want from her and how the world isnt fair during june and rarly july she was fired and hired from so many jobs that i lost count but it was easily 12 jobs and she got fired from every single one of them finally as it was early july i gave up with helping her and went back to work meanwhile she promised that she would find a job shes worked about 13 jobs between july and now the longest employment before she was fired lasted 2 days and now its gotten to the point where im done with her sabotaging herself at every job she gets or scheduling interviews for jobs and either not going or self sabotaging during the interview to not get hired recently ive gotten so fed up with her not having a job and leeching off me that i gave her an ultimatum around october 17th i told her that either she gets a job which is stable she holds the job and starts getting back up on her feet by november 20th or ill have no choice but to kick her out of my car as soon as she heard my ultimatum she started looking for and found a job she spoke with the lady offering the job over the phone on speakerphone with me close by to prove to me she had gotten serious and was getting a job she and the woman offering the job eventually agreed to meet on friday november 7th at 430pm at a dunkin donuts in order to discuss details of the job and finalize her employment start date etc i dropped her off at the dunkin which she was supposed to meet her at since i had an important work related event which i had to attend so i drove off to attend the event i picked her up a few hours later and while driving home i asked her about how her meeting with her potential employer went she proceeded to describe her whole meeting with the woman among 1000 other unnecessary details about her and eventually she got back to the important part of the conversation and told me that she will be starting work on monday so november 10th i was so relieved at the possibility of her finally getting serious about life and starting a job that even though the way she spoke about the meeting seemed a little off to me i still pushed past the feeling and was genuinely relieved and happy for her that she had finally got her act together on monday i had the day off from work but i still had some errands and things to do so i woke up early and headed over to my car fully expecting to not find her in there since she had her first day of work and she had mentioned the day prior that she will have to get up early around 5am to catch the bus and later the train to get to work i opened my car door to get my ice scraper and low and behold i find her still in my car i got in my car and drove to my doctors appointment and on the way i asked her what had happened with today regarding her job i asked her if she had slept in accidentally or whatever she told me that at the meeting with her new employer last week the lady apparently told her that she the woman hiring her is monitoring the weather for monday and that if it snows then her first day will be rescheduled to tuesday the 18th of november the following week i immediately called bullshit in my mind on the whole if it snows im rescheduling your start date to next week on tuesday i immediately knew she was lying and even though i was furious i decided to hide the anger and pretended to believe her throughout the day as she accompanied me from place to place meanwhile i decided to find out the truth for myself in the evening i decided to text the woman since she my girlfriend had used my phone to call and text her i shot a text over pretending to be my girlfriend asking when would i be able to start working the woman quickly texted back well first i need to meet you and i can meet you tomorrow at 10am if that works for you i replied with why do we need to meet first and she texted back well we need to meet because first of all i need to see speak with and get to know who im potentially going to hire and hand over a company vehicle to as soon as i finished reading i reread it a few times more because i couldnt believe what i was reading and the scale of bullshit and lies my girlfriend was feeding me she literally just fucking got me to drop her off she most likely wandered around the nearby mall located about 20 minutes away from the dunkin and walked back to the dunkin so that when i come by to pick her up i wont have any suspicions and instead of telling me the truth she elected to bullshit me i dont know whats wrong with her and im honestly so fed up with her bullshit its gotten to a point where im basically her caregiver and provider earlier in the year she mentioned that she had depression and mental illness and blamed her problems on those things including her problems with finding and holding down a job so i got her to go to a therapist and psychiatrist like 4 times she later on told me that she wouldnt be going to the therapist or psychiatrist for any further appointments since it isnt helping her and that she doesnt like going to a doctor we havent had sex in like a year aswell since i refuse to engage in any of the sort with her even though she has tried multiple times since a year ago at a routine doctors appointment the doctor discovered that she has bacterial vaginosis and an untreated serious uti which even though she received a prescription medication to treat it she just decided to throw it out and not take it since she knows better then the doctor apparently im just so tired of everything when i originally hooked up with her it was never my intention to have a serious relationship with her at the time i only wanted a casual friends with benefits type of friendship but ever since shes been stuck to me like glue and refuses to leave no matter how many times ive told her that its over to make everything worse shes always been a liar and had a lying problem shes notoriously a big bullshiter and liar and had that reputation before we even met ive always wondered if her lying is caused by mental illness is she not able to tell the truth why cant she just work like any other normal person and hold down a job its not rocket science im just so done with everything that i dont even know anymore ive thought everything through and i think ive come to the conclusion that when the 20th rolls around and she still doesnt have a stable job ill kick her out of my car since if she never hits rock bottom and if i continously keep being kind to her shell never get back on her feet or find a job if anyone has anything to add or ideas advice etc then feel free to chime in i feel kinda like a cruel asshole due the fact that im planning to kick her out on the 20th and i feel conflicted even though im pretty sure thats what i
