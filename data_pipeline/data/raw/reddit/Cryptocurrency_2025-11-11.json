    "you are a social media expert come up with a good title for a reddit post to help push my enviromental propaganda make it impossible for the average redditor to not rage click were being fed a steady diet of articles about how your chatgpt queries are destroying the planet while industrial agriculture which dwarfs ais impact by an order of magnitude gets treated like background noise this isnt an accident its a textbook example of what researchers call climate delay discourse industrial livestock is responsible for 1120 of all global greenhouse gas emissions the global food system overall accounts for about a third of humancaused emissions half the worlds habitable land goes to agriculture and 7580 of that agricultural land is dedicated to livestock either as pasture or growing animal feed animal products contribute more than onequarter of humanitys entire water footprint and its not just beef dairy production generates about 32 of global greenhouse gas emissions on its own a kilogram of cheese produces about 135 kg of co2 equivalent higher than chicken or pork a liter of milk generates about 32 kg of co2 equivalent and requires about 628 liters of water to produce the global dairy sector uses roughly 10 of all agricultural land and 20 of agricultural emissions the entire data center ecosystem ai cryptocurrency everything is projected to hit around 4 of global electricity demand by 2026 training a large ai model produces emissions equivalent to about 300 roundtrip flights both matter but you wouldnt know it from the discourse ai gets endless handwringing think pieces agriculture gets what exactly heres what makes me absolutely crazy people will share articles about how your ai queries are destroying the planet then go eat a burger without a second thought you cant get most people to even acknowledge that beef has a significant environmental impact mention it and youre immediately dismissed as preachy extreme pushing an agenda the defensiveness is instant and total but suggest that maybe we should be cautious about ai use suddenly everyones a concerned environmentalist this selectivity isnt random its psychologically convenient worrying about ai costs you nothing if you werent planning to use it much anyway its new its tech its easy to be suspicious of you can signal environmental concern without changing any behavior that actually matters but your food choices those are three times a day every day those are cultural social tied to pleasure and tradition and identity so weve collectively decided that beef is in the dont examine too closely category while ai queries are an environmental crisis who actually takes this seriously theres a telling pattern in who actually changes their behavior based on environmental evidence climate scientists and researchers themselves are significantly more likely to be vegetarian or vegan than the general population studies show vegetarianism rates among environmental and climate scientists run anywhere from 2040 compared to about 5 in the general us population the people who actually understand the data have changed their behavior the people who share articles about ais environmental impact while eating cheese three times a day have not there is a constant drumbeat of articles about how asking ai to help with your email or generate an image is environmentally questionable every query compared to running a lightbulb for 30 seconds the implication that you should feel guilty every time you use these tools or restrict your usage meanwhile the actual impact of your dietary choices which are orders of magnitude larger gets treated like a personal preference thats nobodys business heres the thing individual choices absolutely matter the problem isnt that were holding individuals accountable the problem is that were holding them accountable for the wrong things in wildly disproportionate ways if you eat beef regularly your annual dietary emissions dwarf anything youll ever do with ai a single quarterpound burger has a carbon footprint of about 66 lbs of co2 eating beef twice a week adds up to over 680 lbs of co2 annually just from that one item a grilled cheese sandwich with 2 oz of cheese produces about 25 lbs of co2 have one of those for lunch three times a week and youre adding nearly 400 lbs annually meanwhile heavy chatgpt use for a year might add up to 50 lbs of co2 but try pointing this out and watch people bend over backwards to avoid the conclusion suddenly its all about regenerative grazing or how almonds use water too or why personal choice doesnt matter compared to corporate emissions which notably include producing the meat and dairy youre eating why this matters climate delay this is textbook climate delay discourse rhetoric that accepts climate change is real but redirects attention away from effective action were obsessing over a sector that represents 4 of electricity while studiously avoiding any conversation about the food system that causes 30 of all emissions weve created a moral panic about new behaviors ai use while refusing to examine far more harmful existing ones dietary choices and heres the kicker with ai your individual use barely matters your decision to use or not use chatgpt has essentially zero impact on emissions or water use but your food choices those directly create demand every burger you dont buy is one less burger that needs to be produced every block of cheese you skip is one less block that needs to be made the causal chain is direct and immediate so weve managed to fixate our environmental anxiety on the thing where individual choice matters least while ignoring the thing where it matters most but the corporate harm is real now this doesnt mean ai infrastructure has no environmental impact it absolutely does and its concentrated in specific communities in ways that are unconscionable memphis xais illegal operation elon musks xai built its colossus supercomputer in south memphis the facility needed 150 megawatts enough for over 100000 homes when the local utility couldnt provide it xai just built their own power plant with at least 35 gas turbines they ran these turbines for six months without air permits a clear clean air act violation the facility went into south memphis zip 38109 a predominantly black neighborhood that was already an environmental sacrifice zone with cancer rates four times the national average since operations started nitrogen dioxide levels near the facility jumped 79 residents report smells like rotten cabbage and new severe asthma attacks at the only public hearing an xai executive read a statement then walked out before public comment an xai manager told the local rotary club that for their next facility we are copying and pasting what we did metas water grab in papillion nebraska metas data center uses millions of gallons of water for cooling residents describe a constant industrial hum that never stops not at night not on weekends never one resident said its like living next to an airport in dekalb illinois meta built a facility that uses up to 17 million gallons of water per day the citys water system was already stressed but meta got priority access while residents were asked to conserve in taos new mexico high desert country where water is precious meta proposed a data center that would consume 12 million gallons daily locals organized and stopped it but only after a fight in louisiana meta is building in richland parish a rural area where median household income is around 35000 the facility will use an estimated 15 million gallons of water per day and employ maybe 50100 people mostly requiring specialized skills locals dont have these are different problems requiring different solutions the memphis situation is about regulatory capture and environmental justice its about whether companies can break the law in poor neighborhoods with impunity but your food choices those are directly causing the environmental impact the meat and dairy industries produce what you buy reduce demand reduce production its not complicated both things need to be addressed but they need to be addressed differently for ai infrastructure regulation permitting environmental justice law corporate accountability proper siting decisions for agriculture actual changes in consumption patterns because thats what drives production you cant regulate your way out of agricultural emissions if people keep eating the same amount of meat and cheese the demand is the problem the hypocrisy is the point the tech companies love that youre worried about your prompts microsoft will tout being carbon negative by 2030 while their electricity consumption nearly triples google will claim 12 emissions reductions using marketbased accounting while their actual locationbased emissions rise 22 but the agricultural industry loves it even more every article about ais environmental impact is one less article examining the catastrophic impact of industrial meat and dairy production every person wringing their hands about chatgpt is one less person questioning their burger or their cream cheese what actually needs to happen we need to be able to hold two thoughts simultaneously 1 ai infrastructure needs democratic oversight environmental regulation and must not be dumped on vulnerable communities the memphis situation is inexcusable metas water grabs are inexcusable these require policy solutions and enforcement 2 your dietary choices have a far larger environmental impact than your ai use and pretending otherwise is climate delay if youre actually concerned about your personal environmental impact the beef and dairy matter more than the prompts by a lot the people freaking out about ai while eating beef and cheese multiple times a week are engaged in what psychologists call moral licensing performing concern in one area to avoid examining behavior in another its the environmental equivalent of buying a carbon offset for your private jet the real conversation start asking yourself honest questions about your actual highimpact consumption choices and yes also demand that xai follows the clean air act demand that meta cant drain aquifers in droughtprone regions demand proper environmental review before data centers get built but dont pretend that sharing articles about ais energy use makes you an environmentalist while youre eating beef for lunch and putting cheese on everything dont use concern about ai as a shield against examining the choices that actually matter the climate crisis requires honesty about scale and impact right now were being spectacularly dishonest selectively outraged about new technologies while giving ourselves a pass on far more destructive everyday behaviors",

    "how much matters more than what in investing the majority of investing discussions you will see and hear involve the question what however the most important investing decisions you will ever make usually involve how much get the how much decisions right and the what decisions wont matter nearly as much successful investing consider what it takes to be successful in reaching your financial goals 1 adequate funding a how much issue 2 a reasonable investing plan a what issue 3 staying the course with that plan which matters the most far and away its step 1 in fact if you save enough money it really doesnt matter what you invest in at all but no investment will provide returns adequate to overcome a minimal investment amount what vs how much questions were always asking questions like should i invest in actively managed or passively managed mutual funds yes getting the what right does have an effect the answer is passive by the way but really the question is a how much question how much of my money should i put into passive vs active funds if you put 90 into passive funds youre going to be fine if you put 10 into passive funds youre likely to underperform the how much matters more than the what nearly 100 of financial news financial blogs and financial advice are concentrated on what to buy and sellcrypto r estate commodities options stocks bonds cds or mygas we shouldnt be surprised when investors think those are the most important questions but dont these how much questions matter a whole lot more how much of a good investment should you buy how much leverage should you use to buy it how much should you spend to insure against low probability events how much should you spend vs save today how much should you spend over time consider people who have become financially ruined due to a bad investment or fraud what was the problem was the problem that they chose a bad investment or was the problem that they put too much money into it or borrowed too much money to buy it sizing matters remember the debacle that was long term capital management the bets they made would have paid off over the next few years but the short term comes before the long term too much leverage and too much was placed on those bets they couldnt ride out the short term to get to the long term the same issue happens with real estate investors how do you turn a cash flow negative property into a cash flow positive property you put more money down what is cash flow negative with a 20 down payment is often cash flow positive with a 33 down payment the problem isnt the investment a what question the problem is the leverage a how much question cash flow positive investors can ride out long real estate downturns cash flow negative investors declare bankruptcy or they end up firesaleing assets dr dahle invested in a fund that focused on buying singlefamily homes prices fluctuate but there wasnt a major downturn or anything the investment thesis about singlefamily homes being a good investment was fundamentally sound especially in the long term the problem for this fund was that it tried to grow too quickly and to do so it took on debt at terms that turned out to be unfavorable as interest rates unexpectedly rose the result was a significant loss of capital for all of the investors the problem wasnt the singlefamily homes it was that the fund bought too many of them what saved his portfolio from this disaster the fact that he didnt invest very much into the fund he was still trying it out with something like 02 of his portfolio when it imploded the size of your bets matters more than what the bets are when risky bets are small and leverage is low the portfolio may take a hit but it survives large leveraged bets are a pathway to eventual financial ruin good bets with bad sizing can be catastrophic where are all the billionaires the authors of the missing billionaires make this point well their premise is that there should be a lot more billionaires than there are today even with estate taxes and the dilution of fortunes among multiple heirs as they write considering 100 million in 1877 is the equivalent of 29 billion today what happened to all these people they had how much problems as you make your financial plan and work through your financial life put at least as much focus on the how much decisions as on the what decisions",
