    "denied ll at 17 even with parivahan application went to the rto yesterday for a license to ride an electric scooter with a max speed of 70kmph and 4kw which can be used by 1618 year olds now apparently as it comes under the same 50cc category which was there before for under 18 but when i went to the rto with my application form which i got online after filling details and documents the guy at the rto said only 50cc is allowed for under 18 and started arguing saying where is there a 50cc scooter and denied license but when i tried telling him about the 70kmph electric scooter which im supposed to be allowed to ride the man started saying get me vehicle documents first to prove that i have a 70kmph scooter and then hell give license my plan was to get a license for that category scooters and buy tvs orbiter which comes under 70kmph limit so im legally allowed to ride it how do i go about this is the guy at the rto allowed to ask me for vehicle documents to issue my ll or is he just supposed to give me the ll as when i applied on parivahan it shows 16 can ride mcwog",
    "icom 7100 and toyota hybrid suv good friends vhfhf i think i finally have a good working mobile vhfhf installation in my toyota hybrid suv using a hustler mag mount and the icom 7100 the 12 volt car battery in my new toyota suv is located under the rear cargo cover inside of my vehicle i was able to take power directly off the 12 v battery and run it to the rear corner of my vehicle i ran the antenna coax to the rear corner where i put the main unit of the 7100 it was then just a simple matter of running ethernet cabling to the front of my vehicle where i installed the remote head having the main unit within a few feet of the car battery with a direct feed seems to have eliminated most if not all of the electrical interference from the hybrid drive train apparently the icom 7100 is also very sensitive to any drop in voltage i have been to transmit with the engine off despite a lower voltage the 7100 does not have an internal tuner i am able to transmit full power on hf 20m and 40m with ham stickhustler antennas as the swr is under 30 even using a mag mount with the radio at full power i hope folks find this info helpful",
    "in defense of the t or more accurately in defense of rail transit ive been seeing a lot of comments on here lately touting the lower estimated operating costs of the east busway as some sort of incontrovertible proof that buses are superior to rail in every possible case and that the region should never again attempt a rail project for any reason while the comparison makes sense in that it mitigates the typical accounting problem of buses relying on and beating up taxpayerfunded public streets though the busway does still rely on public streets at either end of its routes it is still an oversimplification consider the following points 1 the t uses 100 electric vehicles while prt buses still burn fossil fuels your lungs and the climate are subsidizing the busway more than the t have you ever smelled a bus in the street as a pedestrian sure prt could electrify the busway using trolley buses or battery buses but that would require more expensive vehicles and an infrastructure buildout oh and did you know that battery vehicles are heavier and wear out the pavement faster 2 the t does a harder job in terms of routes and alignment the t serves hilly suburban neighborhoods on a tricky alignment with lots of hills and grade crossings with all of that adding maintenance complexity prt recently had to tear out and rebuild a street crossing for the t in mt lebanon so that traffic didnt bottom out as badly on the tracks the east busway uses a relatively flat completely gradeseparated heavy rail alignment in the middle of the city it doesnt have to worry about intersections its stations are spaced further apart the pavement doesnt need to deal with braking forces as much prt doesnt really need to coordinate with penndot or domi to do busway maintenance none of those advantages and disadvantages have to do with the vehicles on the rights of way in fact a huge part of the east busways efficiency comes down to the citys infrastructure layout being a giant f you to the hill district i dont have a source but ive heard that the t literally exists because of how infeasible it was to replace the south hills trolley system with buses you cant fault the technology for being more expensive when its competition literally couldnt do the job can you speaking of which see point 4 3 the t crosses 2 rivers on its own infrastructure no busway does technically just a continuation of point 2 but i feel its important enough to stand on its own 4 the pandemic happened i used to live on the east busway before the pandemic the buses were routinely packed to the doors at rush hour buses would just pass by and refuse to pick me up because they were full this was not an occasional thing it was just the status quo i and presumably hundreds of other riders drove biked walked or took different buses at least some days of the week to avoid dealing with the busier lines on the east busway the busway was failing to meet this demand meanwhile trains are more scalable than buses the t can run 2 or even 3car trains during periods of high demand without needing more drivers maybe today the busway is rightsized and the t is overbuilt but before the pandemic the t was the right size and the busway was trying and failing to do a trains job 5 the t is a hodgepodge mishmash of legacy systems and cant be taken as representative of light rail in general for one thing serving 3 fundamentally different types of stations means that your rail vehicle needs extra doors that need extra maintenance and why havent they eliminated the 2 stops 200 feet from each other yet 6 sometimes you get what you pay for the ts manned fare booths and high platform stations are expensive but they serve a purpose they improve accessibility for wheelchairs bicycles and strollers and they allow a large number of passengers to board at once without holding up the vehicle buses get stuck waiting when more than 2 or 3 passengers get on at once the t is also quieter roomier and has more space inside for stuff like wheelchairs and strollers though it could still be way better in this regard this is not theoretical i routinely make tbike trips that i couldnt make on the bus because the bike i use for carrying kids cant fit on the bus racks maybe the t should charge a higher fare for this relative luxury compared to buses but beware the mba business consultant enshitification philosophy of cheaper better 7 the t could theoretically be improved not so sure about the busway standardize the platforms get rid of the redundant station in beechview downsize the overbuilt parkandride lots in castle shannon x2 and dormont to build transitoriented housing delete the lowplatform doors and rearrange the seats to make even more room for wheelchairs and bikes work with municipalities to reduce conflicts with motor vehicles and reorient main streets in the south hills toward transit like they used to be i could probably go deeper into the weeds regarding the relationship between the t and the stadiums and maybe an acknowledgement that individual sections of the t are perhaps more different from each other than the individual busways are but i think ive covered all of the major points maybe the t would still lose the comparison at the end of the day but the current discourse isnt doing the situation justice tldr the t has its issues but comparing one of the best busways in the country which benefits from a clutch urban rail alignment to an old frankenstein rail line that serves scattered hilltop suburbs is not a fair comparison especially if you ignore externalities and yes reducing emissions and providing more than the bare minimum of accessibility costs money",
    "21 etron prestige thoughts after 6 months and 13k miles awhile back i learned id be needing a new car and i decided to make the switch to electric having always been an automotive enthusiast camaro el camino lexus sc400 porsche 924s as some previously owned cars i wanted something fun to drive my career requires a lot of driving though so i also wanted something comfortable it also requires me to occasionally carry a lot of stuff so having a larger cargo capacity would be a nice bonus i settled on an audi etron after a few weeks of research on paper it fit my every need turns out in reality it pretty much as well below are my pros and very few cons pros insanely comfortable it is by far the most comfortable vehicle ive owned or even ridden in the front seats massage who even needs that i didnt think i did but man im glad to have it now oh and road noise is so much quieter in this vehicle than others ive been in fun to drive an electric drivetrain makes vehicles a blast the instaneous torque and consequent acceleration is amazing and hasnt gotten old yet doubt it ever will audi also did a superb job with the suspension in dynamic mode it corners and handles surprisingly well for a suv the weighs over two and a half tons charging speed fast charging from 30 to 80 takes roughly 20 minutes on a 150kw charger not bad at all at home with a level 2 evse running at 44amps the etron reaches full charge typically before i go to bed after getting home around 6pm maintenance costs service at the dealership has not been anything crazy much to my surprise also not having to deal with oil changes or most other consumables has been nice aesthetics this is personal but i really think this a gorgeous vehicle with great lines cons efficiency i knew the etron was inefficient compared to other evs but in the summer id average 25 miles per kw and now in colder weather im seeing 15 miles per kw typically so my monthly home charging costs wound up about 30 more than i anticipated",

    "thawed 18 and now we continue the stalwart adventures of arthur coldwater man of tomorrow along with his intrepid alien pals in this weeks adventure we journey down to cajun country to find out whatever happened to arthurs son toby along with another big surprise huge thanks to uanonymdoge for proofreading this and saving me from my grammer first previous memory transcription subject aurthur coldwater anxious cajun date standardized human time january 31 2137 i groaned rolling myself out of bed as the alarm on my holopad went off halfalive i made my way over to the beeping tablet on my desk grabbing it and turning off the alarm it was time i knew the transport would be here to pick us up within a couple of hours and i needed to have my housemates ready this trip promised to show me my sons destiny i wish i knew what i was about to face still i was glad i wouldnt face it alone forcing myself from the warm comforting embrace of the blankets i pulled myself up and grabbed some of the supplied clothes the pants were fairly standard blue jeans but the tshirt i found felt oddly fitting there was a cartoonish looking venlil on the stomach with i heart symbol venlil written above it i couldnt wait to see jammys face when he sees it after getting dressed i made my way out of the room and up to the bathroom i took the electric razor jammy had got me and made a quick job of trimming my face it was funny that so much had come from his desire to get me one little gift and having been too embarrassed to just speak his mind while giving me it still it was nice to have it definitely was a step up from the crappy disposable razors the un supplied with that accomplished i gave my face a quick wash and moved to wake my housemates thankfully izra and jammy had set alarms to wake themselves up and were already waiting for me downstairs on the couch by the time i finished i could see my new boyfriend shit it still felt so weird to think of him as that he had braided some of his excessively thick wool i liked it he was already adorable but the addition of the thick almost vikinglike braids just added to it he seemed to notice my shirt and let out a beep of approval morning i greeted as i walked into the living room smiling brightly at the pair sitting on the couch honestly i was nervous as hell but i wasnt going to let them know that good morning friend arthur izra replied adjusting her goggles for the day it seems only our little hatchling still needs roused i nodded in reply moving to mixsels room it had been the first night in a while she hadnt had a nightmare about that dog and she was actually in her own bed that night i hoped that meant she was getting over her initial trauma maybe i should have her talk to bilon it was working for me i walked into mixsels room finding my tiny little sivkit under the blankets clinging tight to frank the stuffed venlil was starting to look rather worn and i could see the stitching around one of his arms starting to give exposing the cotton beneath i would need to work on that soon thankfully i had experience sewing up plushies toby had kept a plethora of them as a kid i walked over to her bed reaching down and gently shaking her time to wake up munchkin i cooed smiling as i watched those big green eyes slowly pry open nooo too eawly she whimpered closing her eyes again and fighting my attempts to rouse her i reached a hand down sliding into her thick white fur and gently began to shake her wake up mon chrie i insisted pressing my hand into her side hard enough to make her roll back and forth i heard my little sivkit let out a groan her big green eyes finally opening i know its early i cooed but we gotta get moving i assured her the transport leaves soon the child whined hugging tight to frank and otherwise not responding with a chuckle i grabbed her sheets forming them into a sort of shell as i picked her up lifting the sleeping sivkit in my arms it wasnt my first time having to rouse a child at 5am mixsel offered no resistance as i hoisted her into the air still wrapped in her blankets i got you mon chrie i whispered hugging the still sleeping sivkit tight against my chest i couldnt help but smile as i felt her softly breathing against me i could remember toby in the same place no matter how long i was removed from it it seemed time couldnt take the father instinct out of me i carried my fluffy little bundle back out into the living room i think were ready i laughed hugging my snoozing sivkit tight jammek looked up at the little fluffball and gave an adorable bleat of approval before reaching out one paw and gently petting her sleeping form even izra seemed to find the sight amusing her tail thrashing behind her as she stood up it was nice to see her happy it had felt like shed been rather grumpy for some reason the last couple of days let us get moving then the arxur replied moving over to the door as she gave her goggles one final adjustment part of me silently wondered what the world must look like to her with her eyes adapted to seeing at night i imagined it must be like living in a world where there was a spotlight constantly glaring in your face i felt a tinge of pity at that i couldnt imagine living in a world where everyone else is active when you want to sleep i took that back i had worked nightshift at a gas station for three years it was probably a lot like that once we had gotten outside i could see a black suv approaching from the front of the camp the vehicle made its way up to the house before stopping with the rear door opening for us i could see eva already inside grinning so wide i imagined it must hurt come on the transport is waiting for us she announced shuffling to the side as our small group piled in she looked over at mixsel sleeping in my arms and let out a happy squeal oh my god arthur she giggled that may be the sweetest thing ive ever seen dont let her fool you i chuckled taking a seat beside the un officer shes a little hellion when shes awake i gently reached my free hand down brushing aside a tuft of fur that had slid over her face eva kept looking on that grin never fading jammek piled in next to me with izra clumsily clawing her way into the remaining seat so you gonna tell me what this is all about now i asked shaking my head a bit eva looked like she was about to explode from excitement nope she answered bluntly stifling a laugh i think itll be more interesting to surprise you the car finally took off now that we were all seated and i looked up to the front trying to see who was driving to my surprise the drivers seat was completely vacant selfdriving vehicles eh i quietly hoped they had improved that technology from my time i could recall a few prototypes of that tech from my era and they didnt have a very good track record thankfully the trip from the house out of the camp and over to the transport was fairly brief and the selfdriving car performed admirably we didnt end up in a ditch anyways the transport ship was the blocky squarelooking type that had brought us down to earth from the un ship last month how did you even manage this i asked as the car came to a stop i thought the whole reason we were in that camp was because theres no spare ships to move people around oh once i found out who your son was it wasnt too difficult she replied cryptically i cocked an eyebrow at that she was enjoying playing out this mystery a little too much plus this transport is defective the sealing is bad so its not fit for space works perfectly fine in atmosphere though i dont know how i feel about riding in something youre already saying is defective jammek whined as eva opened the door and stepped out the woman just waved at his concerns dismissively its fine she assured him our small group piled out onto the flat concrete landing zone i could see that bilon and nalva were waiting for us in front of the transport the venlil woman was busily looking at her holopad and seemed quite excited good morning arthur bilon greeted the zurulian waddling his way over as our group exited the vehicle i wont be coming today but i wanted to check how you were feeling before you left im fine doc i assured him giving him a quick smile just curious about what the hell is even happening i added shooting eva a look the woman just laughed maniacally at my answer yes bilon sighed glaring at her himself i would prefer you go into this knowing what is happening im worried about doc im fine i interrupted with a sigh honestly i felt something wrap around my wrist and looked down finding jammeks fluffy tail wrapped around it dont worry dr bilon the skalgan interjected ill be there for him that does make me feel a bit better the little teddy bear huffed looking from the tail around my wrist up to my face just please dont hesitate to call me if something happens ok i gave the concerned little guy a nod damn it was hard to take these aliens seriously when they all looked so damned cute not as cute as my jammy but still dont worry doc i laughed reaching over with my tail entwined arm and grabbing jammeks waist ive got my emotional support venlil ill be fine i gave him a playful squeeze at the base of his tail jammeks face flushed a bright orange at that making me laugh he was so cute when he got flustered arthur he whined wiggling in my grasp that spot youre touching his voice trailed off as nalva finally looked up from her holopad and made her way over hello you two she greeted rubbing her eye i swear i cant get used to these day qnight cycles good morning nalva i greeted her i could feel jammys tail squeeze tighter around my wrist i just wanted to catch you two before your trip to let you know we have a definitive date for your trip to skalga she announced happily finally using the proper name for her own planet i could feel the approval surge through jammys tail his grip tightening when do we go jammek asked suddenly enthusiastic i looked over to my venlil partner a bit taken aback at his enthusiasm any time id brought it up before he seemed apprehensive i was glad to see he had started warming up to the idea personally i was pumped at the chance to visit an alien planet i wondered if jammek felt like that visiting earth we are scheduled to leave in three days earth time she answered splaying her ears out happily i hope you two are ready governor tarva has a press conference planned for after we arrive and it isnt a problem with me and munchkin tagging along i added absolutely not in fact one of the doctors working on the decuring project was really excited to have you come nalva bleated hes got a side project trying to prove human empathy isnt a recent development having a human from over a century ago take the standard empathy tests would help a ton i would like a chance to go over what that test involves before you volunteer arthur bilon interrupted eyeing the gray venlil cautiously interesting i replied as eva began to herd our group up onto the ship id love to participate if doc says its ok we can talk more about it when we get back i laughed feeling eva give me a playful push up the loading ramp of the transport come on people eva chuckled giving izra a wave to hurry up were burning daylight here as we loaded up into the small metal box i gave one last look down at nalva and bilon at the bottom of the ramp giving the pair a wave before taking my seat the transport wasnt much to speak of simply two rows of sturdy metal seats lined up on either side of the sizable hold and a small room at the front for the pilots i could see a pair of un guards sitting there one of them looking back and watching us curiously i shot the man a quick nod as jammy sat down next to me are you excited he asked watching as the ramp began to withdraw and the door sealed nervous is more like it i replied feeling a bit apprehensive at my lack of knowledge for what was to come everyone settle in eva announced taking a seat herself and pulling the strap on her seat into place we have about two hours of flight time till we get down to baton rouge well i guess at least i know where were going now i said giving a nervous laugh jammek reached over and put a paw comfortingly on my knee eva seemed to pick up on the gesture immediately her eyes getting wide i take it you read his story then she asked me looking positively giddy jammek meanwhile looked absolutely horrified how did you know about that he gasped islatta showed me she answered holding a hand over her mouth as she snickered im going to kill her the venlil brayed burying his face in his paws as his face flushed bright orange i couldnt help but laugh putting a hand on his shoulder hey its fine jammy i assured him im cool with the whole camp knowing what a stud i am the venlil baaed embarrassedly not bothering to withdraw his paws from his eyes archivist note the following appears to be a particularly vivid dream the subject was experiencing it has been left in due to relevance hey now i said wiping the back of my hand over tobys cheek to collect the tear that was falling calm down and tell me what happened the poor boy looked like a wreck he was covered in scrapes and i could see his lip was swelling i i got in a fight he sniffled wiping his own eyes with the back of one arm we were playing football and david said i tackled him too hard we started yelling and then ah i replied sitting down beside him on the steps in front of my apartment those things happen im sure you guys will make up and get over it no he spat i hate him hes just a jerk dont say that toby i sighed putting an arm over his shoulder and tugging the boy tight against me you shouldnt hate people why he huffed still sniffling david is a jerk maybe he is and maybe he isnt i answered giving him a shake of my head but never hate hate is poison son it doesnt make anything better and it doesnt hurt the one youre angry at it just poisons your mind and soul i reached up tussling the mop of brown hair atop his head hate never makes anything son it just destroys so dont hate someone no matter how angry you may be with them there was a long pregnant silence between us as we stared out across the road and watched cars speeding by do you hate grandpa and grandma he asked finally looking up at me i sighed once more no son why they said awful things about you grandpa said hed kill you if he saw you again how can you not hate them for that he growled why on earth had he decided to bring that back up because hating them wont make anything better toby i explained all it would do is torture myself i choose to let it go and move on how can you just let it go he grumbled looking like he might start crying i gave him another squeeze because its my choice to do that i replied i choose to not let the awful things they said affect me even as the words left my mouth i knew that wasnt entirely honest they did affect me they hurt me in ways i couldnt put into words but that wasnt what toby needed to hear if you say so dad he responded leaning his head onto my shoulder i guess i dont really hate him im just pissed i know how that is i laughed happy to change the subject you should go talk to him and work it out i bet he feels the same way maybe he huffed putting his hands on his knees as he pulled himself up off the steps thanks dad thats what im here for i chuckled as he turned to walk off towards the field beside the apartment where the kids all tended to play i sat silently for a moment and watched him go he was a good kid he was going places i quietly wished i could do more for him that i could offer him a better life he was a smart kid transcription returning to current time wake up arthur jammek beeped shaking me gently i groaned opening my eyes my pad glowed in my hands a long list of facts about skalga or venlil prime as the article called it still open on my lap were landing i rubbed my eyes groggily and let out a yawn mixsel had apparently woken up some time while i was napping and was busily showing frank off to eva the woman looked up as she noticed me waking anyone ever tell you that you snore like crazy she laughed mixsel let out a giggle making a mocking snoring sound and closing her eyes just like that haha i answered giving the little sivkit a grin before sticking my tongue out that was greeted by even more laughter from the small fluffball i felt the ship around me suddenly lurch the sound of metal on pavement announcing we had landed izra stood up first rushing over to the door as it opened and the ramp distended finally she growled adjusting her goggles before walking down the ramp i cant stand being stuck in tight spaces like that for hours get a little claustrophobic i asked standing up and grabbing mixsel before following her and jammy down the ramp we appeared to be in a small parking lot i could see a handful of police cars blocking the area off and another black suv waiting for us any chance youll tell me why were here now i asked my eyes scanning the shopping center around the parking lot it seemed familiar as we exited the air conditioned transport i was hit with that old familiar muggy heat i took in a deep breath as i gazed out of the clear blue sky above it was nice to be back here youll know why youre here in just a minute eva promised walking over and opening the door to the suv for us i just groaned and rolled my eyes before getting inside pretty sure i know where we are i said at last as eva got inside i used to live in an apartment near here it looks a little different but im pretty sure this is just down the road from rosalin park right eva looked like she was about to burst as i said that sort of she responded being as purposefully cryptic as she could sort of how i sighed well it isnt called rosalin park anymore she explained gesturing out the window as the selfdriving vehicle took off i could see two more police cars falling into line behind us escorting the vehicle whats it called now i asked as the suv took a right at the nearby intersection and headed towards the park i couldnt help but notice the utter lack of cars on the road had eva somehow arranged to have the area cut off to the public for this in answer to my question she simply pointed out the rightside window i followed where she was pointing and found a large stone sign that read coldwater memorial park what the hell i gasped leaning towards the window and squinting convinced for a moment that i must have misread that its coldwater memorial park now she finally answered her smile growing so large it looked like it was about to wrap the rest of the way around to the back of her head i i dont understand i muttered in shock izra was looking between the outside and me rapidly for a moment does that statue have something to do with why were here she asked gesturing a claw out the window as the car came to a stop it certainly does eva explained putting a hand on my knee arthur if you had told me your sons full name was james tobias coldwater that first day i would have been able to tell you then now come on you need to see this i sat frozen in place for a moment my legs simply refusing to move as izra opened the door and stepped out with mixsel and eva i couldnt move i looked out the door seeing the large marble statue standing in the middle of the park a few yards away its back was turned to us from here but i already had a good idea what i was about to see my body didnt want to move though i wasnt sure if i was ready to see my little boy all grown up to face the life i had been ripped away from i looked down at my knees trying to slow my breathing as i realized i was beginning to hyperventilate then jammy put his paw over my hand youve got this he whispered giving my hand a comforting squeeze jammy i whimpered trying to collect myself i dont know if i can do this s seeing him like this im scared to death this is gonna break me jammy it wont he answered bluntly i wont let it i looked up at my fluffy boyfriend his big blue eyes filled with concern youve got this he repeated i gave his hand a squeeze in response finally feeling the life returning to my legs weve got this i answered scooting my way out of the car with the venlils paw still in my hand i turned to see izra and mixsel with eva waiting patiently for me in front of a small walking path that led from the parking area to the statue a few yards away as we began to walk i took a moment to look around drinking in the sites the businesses nearby had changed names and a few new buildings had gone up but the place looked remarkably similar with a smile i saw the small cajun restaurant across the street that i used to take toby to on sunday evenings louiss the sign still read though much more worn and weathered than i remembered it i wondered if they still served vegetarian gumbo the park was empty and i could see several police cars situated around the periphery eva had definitely had the area closed off my time to sightsee was short lived though and before i knew it we had reached the back of the statue i looked up at the imposing figure as we walked around to the front and i felt my breath hitch as i finally saw the face it was covered in wrinkles and smile marks but even now i knew it i could never forget it t toby i whimpered feeling the tears begin to well up behind my eyes as i saw the man my little boy had become his whole figure exuded a sense of calm strength captured in stone the statue seemed to be extending a hand as though trying to help someone up off the ground at the base of the statue i could see a small monitor and beneath that was carved a few words let us leave behind a better world for those who come after us than the one we were given i choked back a sob turning to eva questioningly arthur she explained gently putting a hand on my shoulder your son was the first secretary general of the united nations after it was reformed following the satellite wars he was a key figure in remodeling the uns charter and was an outspoken advocate of human rights for his whole life he was an incredible man i felt something break inside me it was too much i collapsed to my knees and began to sob uncontrollably my toby my sweet toby you became a better man than i could have ever imagined it felt good to know that but at the same time it hurt until now i could think of you like you were still there just waiting for me at home now kneeling at the foot of your statue i had to face the truth you were gone i would never see you again i would never hear your voice again i would never get the chance to hug you and tell you how much i loved you how incredibly proud of you i was i was right this was going to break me i closed my eyes and sobbed as i felt my very soul shatter then i felt a pair of arms wrap around me then another and another i opened my eyes finding myself enveloped in arms jammek mixsel izra they were there just holding me as i bawled my eyes out after a moment i managed to calm down reaching up and wiping my eyes its ok awfu mixsel whined trying to soothe me as she clung tight to my side arthur eva spoke up stepping over to the statue if you think youre ready theres something you need to see i gave her a silent nod and she reached out touching the monitor on the statues base suddenly the screen lit up displaying some old video footage i could see the floor of the united nations as it had been in my time and there behind a podium stood my boy he must have been in his fifties or sixties at least but it was unmistakably him when i was a boy the man behind the podium began a thick cajun accent only barely disguised i remember coming home one day after getting into a fight and telling my father that i hated the kid i had fought he told me something that day that has stuck with me for my whole life hate is a poison it poisons the mind and soul hate cannot create it can only destroy i fought back a choking sob at that he still remembered that after all those years that is why hate has no place in the new world we hope to build the time has come for mankind to grow up to put away the petty rivalries and old grudges that have kept us divided today i believe we have the chance to build a new better world for our children and our childrens children the screen began to grow blurry as my eyes overflowed with tears i fought back my sobs to try and hear what toby was saying suddenly the figure on the monitor turned to look directly into the camera and despite the vast gulf of time and space between us it felt like he was talking directly to me i know so many of you out there feel that its hopeless that everything youve spent your whole life building up has been yanked out from under you overnight do not give up this is not the end its just the beginning together we will build a new world one that we can all be proud of i believe in you each and every one of us will pull through finally the monitor went dark and the picture of my son faded away not that i could see it by then of course since my eyes were overflowing with tears you raised a great man friend arthur izra hissed gently rubbing her claws over the top of my head you should be proud i buried my face in her scaly chest and just quietly sobbed for a moment i was proud i was the proudest damn man on the planet finally i felt like i had cried myself out and i pulled my face away from izras chest wiping the snot from my face on the back of my arm that was when i realized someone else had walked up to us while i had been bawling my eyes out the elderly man stood quietly beside of eva holding her hand as he patiently waited for me to finish hello there i said giving the old man a dry chuckle sorry you had to see that nothing to apologize for he replied shaking his head with a look of astonishment on his face my god you sound just like him like whom i asked leaning on jammy as i pulled myself back to my feet i could see mixsel still looking up at me her big green eyes filled with worry i gently reached down and gave her head a reassuring pat like toby i finished pointing at the statue the old man nodded his bald head arthur eva interrupted putting a hand on the elders shoulder id like to introduce you to my grandfather alexander tobias coldwater i stood staring at the man for a moment turning between him and eva as the gears finally began to turn in my head coldwater i repeated looking eva in the face thats when i saw it her eyes her gray eyes my eyes are you saying that exactly eva giggled finally getting to let out the excitement she had been just barely suppressing arthur im your great great great granddaughter i broke out into a laugh that must have sounded maniacal i couldnt help it though my emotions were in utter chaos at the moment i had grandchildren its an honor to meet you sir alexander said at last im honestly a little embarrassed that eva didnt recognize you sooner i used to take her to the park here every summer our family has always taken great pride in being descended from your son you would think she would have made the connection as soon as you told her your last name its not like there arent a million coldwaters in the world grandpa eva laughed rolling her eyes plus what were the chances he was somehow related to us its wonderful to meet you i responded leaning forward and just grabbing the old man up in a hug it was so strange seeing my grandchild and them being a good thirty years older than me alexander returned the gesture giving me a weak squeeze in response i cant believe all this i said at last releasing my hold on alexander and snatching eva up into a hug this feels so unreal imagine how i feel she laughed hugging me back my great great great grandpa just fell into my lap grandpa jammek snickered from behind me yeah i laughed as i let her go lets just stick with arthur please i feel old as it is sure thing gramps she snorted earning her a quick swat to her ear from alexander respect your elders alexander scolded before turning back to me now what do you say to getting a bite to eat theres a restaurant nearby i think youll love my first family dinner in centuries sounds pretty nice actually i replied",

    "parking for rita castagna at the bowery electric on nov 17 hey everyone seeing some questions about where to park for the rita castagna show so figured id share some tips ive been to the bowery electric a bunch and parking can be a nightmare if you dont have a plan honestly the easiest thing ive found is using an app called prked it lets you rent someones private driveway or garage right next to the bowery electric its usually way cheaper than the public garages and you get to skip most of the traffic chaos since youre not fighting for a spot in a huge lot you just book it on your phone and the spot is waiting for you super short walk to the venue if youd rather use a traditional garage there are a bunch around but they can be pricey you can find places like the one at 22 e 1st st or 375 lafayette st be prepared for it to be around 3050 or even more a lot of them are valet only because the lots are tiny so youll have to leave your keys my advice is to use an app like spothero to book a spot in one of these garages ahead of time it can save you a few bucks and guarantees you have a place now for street parking i wouldnt even try it seriously the bowery itself has almost no legal spots on weekdays and the side streets are a mess of confusing signs with rules about meters commercial vehicles and weird hours even people who live here get tickets all the time you might spend an hour looking for a spot and still end up in a garage its just not worth the stress before a show traffic around there gets really heavy before an event so plan on getting there at least 45 minutes before the show starts to give yourself time to park and walk over another good option is to just take the subway there are a ton of lines that stop near the venue and its way less of a headache than driving hope this helps everyone out its gonna be a great show",

about this is that a blend of the most amazing emotions and light filled experiences as well many things that are dark and outright demonic coexist on our earthly plane now even though both extremes are available to each of us on this planet i find that my predominant experiences are based on my internal vibration when i deliberately work to maintain a high vibration my experiences and the world around me tends to be filled with many positive things when my vibration stays low for too long i tend to descend into some sort of inverted reality or hell realm seeing both sides of this coin has

the hell realm that was brought on by my past whorish behavior as an ignorant wanker and womanizer has been well documented here on our shared forum being brought that low was like being transported

appearance actually completely changed and had me looking like a heroin addict for a while i tried to fight back in the physical plane through arguments and confrontations but something would always mysteriously happen to ensure i never won any of those looking back i think it was the hand of god himself making sure that his son brother cooked wasnt rewarded for worldly sinful behavior and the use of carnal weapons while i was in the depths of hell i slowly started putting the puzzle pieces together i started to see how my life circumstances got worse and worse as i abused my body and my sexuality year after year i started to understand just how hard the world around me worked to keep all of us deceived and living in error i started to understand how most of this world is actually deliberately inverted to trap so many beautiful men and women in a state where they can be fed off of by the system at this point it dawned on me that the only way out was for enough of us to commit to the righteous way of life and raise our collective vibration raising your vibration and escaping the control of the demonic matrix requires a lot of dedication over a prolonged period of time now please note that regardless of what you do there will still be challenges in life which are designed to help us develop and grow however lightening your karmic load will mean that you will overcome these challenges without being completely destroyed or overcome by them below are some tenets to live by if you want to lighten your karmic load and live a more peaceful and rewarding life dont lie dont worry im not talking about the odd white lie here and there to spare someones feelings i am referring to the methodically and deliberately crafted manipulative lies that some people use to trick people out of their inheritances conduct smear campaigns or harm another person in some sort of way upon no real provocation now please note that some level of practicality and discernment is necessary here because not everyone is worthy of knowing the truth about the important things in your life for example you shouldnt be honest about your little nieces whereabouts to a known pedophile as that would put her in unnecessary danger dont be a whore man was i guilty of this one i spent so many days and nights raging and complaining about how promiscuously toxic and selfish women were while conveniently refusing to shine that same spotlight within and see that i was exactly the same way and perhaps even worse at the time i didnt actually genuinely like or respect any of those women from my past and was really only interested in using them as tools to satisfy animalistic lust sexual energy is the most powerful metaphysical energy available to man and abusing it will absolutely darken your outer world with extremely heavy karmic retribution this is one of the major ways to keep you perpetually trapped in the demonic playground of the matrix where satan an his loser demons can torment and mess with you all day avoid intoxicants this is another mistake i frequently made i loved candy bars pastries coffee alcohol pizza mcdonalds soft serve twix ice cream bars red velvet cake sour patch kids and i indulged in all these delicious tasting poisons way too often i even dabbled with weed and cigars from time to time gradually my body got filled with toxins which eventually tanked my vibration and actually made me very irritable distracted fussy and whiny in short eating too many poisons robs you of your manhood when i finally woke up from my slumber and changed my food intake to strictly natural things provided by god i changed the first thing i noticed was my predominant mood and general temperament lightening significantly great nutrition needless to say we humans are physical beings that need food to survive however what i didnt know back then was just how incredibly important the nutrients needed by our physical bodies are for maintaining the health of our souls and minds you see the three pillars of the human organism mind body and soul are inextricably linked if your body is lacking the nutrients it needs to function properly and efficiently you will have a perpetually pissed off spirit and soul this is actually a good thing because it is the feedback loop designed by the heavenly father to get you to fall back in line with natural law i encourage you to start looking at food for your body as you would look at gasoline for your internal combustion engine car or electricity for your electric vehicle think about food as what you need to function first and then try to make that taste as good as possible with natural ingredients that dont have a bunch of sugary garbage in them dont steal yes it is true that you shouldnt steal physical items from people but even much more important is to not engage in energetic theft for example stealing the joy of another person by throwing insults at them is energetic theft stealing the energy of another person by provoking them to anger or trying to drag them into pointless arguments is also energetic theft this is one of the highest levels of karmic debt that a human being can incur so please do not do it this is one reason why narcissists have such bad karma that affects everything and everyone around them narcissists are the human embodiment of energetic theft in closing my dear brothers continue to work on raising your vibration and bringing love and light to your surroundings avoidresist the temptation to fight against negativity because that is a fruitless endeavor in and of itself we cannot actually destroy demons and negativity but we can certainly rise above them by consistently engaging in the proper practices and lifestyle thank you all so much for your support i love you guys no weird stuff till next time brothers godspeed and remain blessed brother cooked",

    "the 50000 sticker shock how regulatory chaos fuels auto industry costs trump has consistently advocated for a sweeping deregulation agenda rooted in the philosophy that environmental and efficiency standards are an impediment to economic growth his view is simple rules designed to improve fuel efficiency or reduce water usage for household items cars and appliances only serve to make products more costly and less functional the stated goal of this approach is to unleash prosperity by stripping away regulatory burdens however a closer look at the american auto industry suggests this antiregulation drive may be generating an outcome precisely opposite to its stated intent instead of lowering costs the policy turmoil is contributing to recordhigh prices for both buying and owning a vehicle while simultaneously crippling the industrys ability to plan for the future the 16 trillion us auto industry finds itself caught in an unsustainable cycle of regulatory whiplash the past decade has seen a dramatic shift in direction with nearly every administration vehicle efficiency standards were tightened under president obama aggressively loosened during trumps first term and then reinstated and strengthened by president biden this instability is the core problem developing a new conventional car typically takes around five years and requires investments of billions of dollars automakers needing a consistent regulatory landscape to justify these monumental investments are forced to operate without a clear target as david cooke of the center for automotive research succinctly put it the recent situation for the industry can be summed up in one word chaos when environmental rules change every few years automakers struggle to meet existing benchmarks and cannot look ahead this constant need to retool development plans scrap existing work and design new compliance strategies adds substantial time and expense to the product development cycle these inflated costs are not absorbed by manufacturers they are inevitably baked into a cars price tag and passed directly to the american consumer the evidence is clear the average price for a new car topped 50000 for the first time in september according to kelley blue book furthermore the operating costs for consumers are rising less efficient vehicles mean more time spent at the pump gasoline represents the single largest energy expenditure for most households averaging around 2930 annually think tanks estimate that repealing existing tailpipe standards could cost us households an extra 310 billion by 2050 primarily through increased fuel consumption the push for deregulation also targets the burgeoning electric vehicle ev market trump has moved to end tax incentives for evs and is withdrawing support for domestic battery production moves that hamstring us car companies while this may align with a desire to slow the transition to electrification it puts us automakers at a disadvantage globally markets like europe are moving toward outright bans on internal combustion engines and china is dominating the production of popular affordable evs american companies must serve these global markets and continue to invest in evs regardless of domestic policy shifts ford for instance is moving forward with plans for a 30000 electric pickup truck intended for both us and export markets showing a continued commitment to the future of electrification ultimately the consensus among industry experts is that while companies may sometimes grumble about stricter regulations the unpredictable stopandstart nature of regulatory policy is a much greater business hindrance this uncertainty not only sets america back with regard to decarbonization but severely hurts us global economic competitiveness and drives up costs for consumers",

    "we will never run out of resources the supply of minerals is theoretically finite but human knowledge and creativity are limitless marian l tupy david deutsch jul 28 2023 summary the fear of running out of resources has been a recurring concern throughout history and continues to come up frequently today evidence suggests that as the fear has turned out to be unfounded in the past it will continue to do so in the future with innovation efficiency gains and the possibility of future technological advancements the concept of unlimited growth becomes conceivable this article delves into the abundance of resources debunking the notion of scarcity and emphasizing the importance of continuous knowledge creation in the process of overcoming supposed limitations the worlds population has increased eightfold since 1800 and standards of living have never been higher despite increases in consumption and contrary to the prophecies of generations of malthusians the world hasnt run out of a single metal or mineral in fact resources have generally grown cheaper relative to income over the past two centuries even on the largest cosmic scale resources may well be limitless how can a growing population expand resource abundance some of the ways are well known consider increased supply when the price of a resource increases people have an incentive to find new sources of it geologists have surveyed only a fraction of the earths crust let alone the ocean floor as surveying and extracting technologies improve geologists and engineers will go deeper faster cheaper and cleaner to reach hitherto untouched minerals efficiency gains also contribute to resource abundance in the late 1950s an aluminum can weighed close to 3 ounces today it weighs less than half an ounce that smaller mass represents considerable environmental energy and rawmaterial savings market incentives motivated people to search for opportunities or new knowledge to reduce the cost of an input aluminum to produce a cheaper output a cocacola can technological improvement drives a continual process whereby we can produce more from less innovation creates opportunities for substitution for centuries spermaceti a waxy substance found in the heads of sperm whales was used to make the candles that provided light in peoples homes long before the whales might have run out we switched to electricity are you worried about having enough lithium to power all those electric vehicles on the road quickcharging sodiumion batteries are already on the horizon there is far more sodium than lithium on or near the surface of the earth were living in an era of dematerialization not long ago every hotel room in the us was equipped with a thick blue copper cable to connect the guests laptop to the internet nowadays guests use wifino cables necessary likewise the smartphone has minimized if not eliminated the need for paper calendars maps dictionaries and encyclopedias as well as for metal or plastic radios cameras telephones stereos alarm clocks and more perhaps less appreciated is that apart from a minuscule amount of aluminum and titanium that we have shot into outer space all of our material resources are still here on earth vast quantities of steel may have been used to build our skyscrapers and copper in power cables but all that metal could be recovered and reassigned during world war ii 14000 tons of silver in the us treasurys west point bullion depository were made into silver wire for electromagnets as part of the manhattan project virtually all of it was eventually returned common sense implies that since no physical resource is infinite the cupboard will eventually grow bare given everincreasing consumption we will reach a level where all useful atoms are physically incorporated into objects that make life enjoyable wont economic growth plateau or reverse course entirely at that point you cant have unlimited growth on a planet with a finite number of atoms or can you this argument has no bearing on any real resource issue it invokes a hypothetical future when we are mining the earths very core for rare elements and draining its oceans to sustain billions of thirsty humans this is so far in the future as not to be relevant to any presentday policies or planning today the bottleneck isnt physical resources but knowledge of how to use them to our benefit not just theoretical knowledge but downtoearth practical engineering knowledge we need to improve that as fast as we can for millennia learned people and charlatans dreamed of transmuting elements in 1919 physicist ernest rutherford achieved the first artificial transmutation by turning nitrogen into oxygen today transmutation is all around us smoke detectors contain americium an artificial element produced by transmutation nuclear physicists achieved the transmutation of lead into gold decades ago though the process requires far too much energy to be a viable alternative to mining but the cost of energy is bound to fall the sun is effectively a nuclear fusion reactor converting millions of tons of mass into energy every second someday soon we will be able to capture as much of that energy as we like via superefficient solar panels the difficulty wont be harvesting that energy but getting rid of waste heat by radiating it into space we may find it more convenient to make our own fusion reactors all the elements found on earth other than hydrogen and helium were made by transmutation in various kinds of stars in the distant future we could use artificial fusion not only for energy but for artificial transmutation to make whatever elements we like all we need is abundant energy and hydrogen which is plentiful in the water that covers most of the earths surface and is the most common element in the universe long before humans have extracted all the useful atoms in the earths crust and oceans we will develop the technological sophistication to obtain vastly more atoms and energy from asteroids planets and beyond in that future just as has always been the case the only bottleneck will be the rate at which new knowledge can be created and nothing prevents us from improving that rate too knowledge is the ultimate resource and there are no limits on creating it this article was originally published in the wall street journal on july 20 2023",

    "seat leon beats honda civic in headtohead test there was once a time when family hatchbacks ruled the sales charts but in recent years their taller suv counterparts have become more popular we think thats a shame because in many cases the hatchbacks have more to offer than their chunkier rivals here we have two cars that aim to prove that the hatchback is due a revival the first is the honda civic which has impressed us ever since this 11thgeneration version was launched in 2022 and it has now benefitted from a midlife refresh the japanese hatchback looks as competitively priced today as it has ever been too its rival here is a car which has long flown under the radar without the appreciation it deserves after what seemed like an uncertain time for seat it looks like the brand will soon find its feet again as we reported last week the ibiza supermini and arona compact suv are being revamped while the larger leon will gain an overhauled powertrain lineup in 2027 as part of a range of updates so its the perfect time to remind ourselves just what seat has to offer both cars have the ability to deserve more success but which model is most worthy of your cash winner seat leon the leon has always been a solid dependable performer in the family hatch class and even in its advancing years theres still a huge amount to like here its not quite class leading when it comes to ride handling or practicality but its solid in all of those key areas while slightly clunky and expensive phev excepted the powertrain lineup is excellent in an area of the market where value for money matters a huge amount its the discounts available on the leon that seal its win here the low prices turn an otherwise competent allrounder into a car that has the measure of a very compelling rival here runner up honda civic in this contest the honda civic has a lot of advantages over its spanish rival its a little quicker rides and handles better although only by a small margin is more frugal in the real world and while headroom is a little tighter it does offer much more legroom too the hondas hybrid powertrain is excellent combining its electric and petrol systems almost seamlessly to make it as smooth to drive as many electric vehicles however while the civic is better value for money than it has been in recent years based on the current deals available the leons bang for the buck is too great to ignore read the full test",

    "mechanical eng or electricalelectronics eng hey guys i live in turkey and have always been interested in technology since i was a child i am currently aiming to study engineering in high school my passion for theoretical physics grew tremendously and i realized that i had good research skills at the time which is why i wanted to study physics back then however my mind has completely changed now and i am aiming for one of these engineering fields mechanical engineering and electricalelectronics engineering i am extremely indecisive between these fields because i am highly interested in both departments and do not anticipate struggling with the courses actually my goal after engineering is to design something myself mechanical part electronic part etc do all the necessary theoretical calculations etc and code the necessary parts with software to produce the product i want in my own lab eg humanoid robots multifunctional vehicles etc that is exactly my goal for this would it make more sense to study mechanical engineering or electricalelectronics engineering at the undergraduate level and which one should i study at the undergraduate level while selfstudying the other pursuing both fields in parallel to reach my desired goal"
